  <p><strong>TAKEN FROM A SPECIAL EDITION OF THE FLOYD COUNTY TIMES DURING THE GULF WAR, ARTICLES PERTAIN TO WWII AND THE KOREAN WAR</strong> &nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>RELEASE OF JAPS' PRISONERS BRINGS JOY, HOPE TO COUNTY</strong> &nbsp; Floyd County had its intimate share in the nationwide wave of thankfulness arising with the news that American prisoners had been liberated on Luzon. &nbsp; One Floyd soldier was released in the heroic commando raid by American Rangers and Filipino guerillas last week which freed 513 American prisoners, survivors of the Bataan's "March of Death" after the fall of Corregidor, and a nurse, a sister of a Floyd county man, was liberated a few days later, from San Tomas internment camp in Manila as McArthur's forces dashed into the capital of the Phillipines. &nbsp; The soldier now among friends and freed Jap cruelty is Pvt. Lawrence Robinson, son of Robert Robinson, of Wayland, and a member of the famed 31st Infantry whose survivors were taken from Corregidor on its fall as prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse is Lieut. Ruby Bradley, 37, Spencer, W.Va., sister of Smith Bradley, Prestonsburg, who was one of the 11 nurses taken prisoner on Bataan. &nbsp; Anxiously awaiting the day when word will come that their sons are released are Mr. & Mrs. W.J. Reynolds, Martin, parents of J.B. (Bud) Reynolds, a medical corpsman on Corregidor at its fall, and Mr. & Mrs. J.E. Walters, of Emma, parents of Seaman Wyman Walters, also taken prisoner on the Phillippines after his ship had been bombed.&nbsp; Letters received by these parents, however, indicate that their sons have been removed to the Japanese mainland.&nbsp; Another Wayland soldier, Fred Williams, was taken prisoner by the Japanese but died in April, 1942, his father J.W. Williams, was notified. &nbsp; Father of Pvt. Robinson, a miner at Wayland, could not be reached for an interview, but The Times was assisted by Noble Hobbs there in gaining an insight into his reaction to the news that his son was safe and at last in a American hands. Mr. Robinson was notified by the American Red Cross in a wire from Lexington that his son had been liberated.&nbsp; He was characteristically reticent.&nbsp; "I didn't work the next day," he quietly remarked. &nbsp; Lieut. Bradley, the nurse freed from internment in Manila, has visited her brother, an employee of the Columbian Fuel Corporation here, several times.&nbsp; An Army nurse since she was graduated from Walter Reed hospital, Washington, D.C., 19 years ago, she was sent to the Philippines in 1938 and was superintendent of nurses at Camp Hay hospital in Manila at the time she deliberately remained behind to care for the wounded as the Japs closed in on the city.</p>
  <p><strong>WIREMAN WINS HERO-AWARD IN RESCUE OF WOUNDED MAN</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp; A Floyd countian's heroism in rescuing his wounded section chief from a flaming battlefield in Korea has won for him the Army's Bronze Star. &nbsp; The decoration was conferred on Sgt. Roy Wireman Jr., son of Mrs. Hazel Wireman, of Wayland, for heroism in action against the enemy Nov. 30, 1950, near Sinchang-ni.&nbsp; He is a member of the First Calvary Division's 7th Calvary Regiment. &nbsp; At the time he earned the medal, Sgt. Wireman- then a private first class- was helping man a roadblock on a main supply route.&nbsp; A force of enemy troops, disguised as civilians, infiltrated through the battalion defense perimeter and were not disovered until they attacked Sgt. Wireman's roadblock.&nbsp; The citation accompanying the Wayland sergant's award tells that he opend fire immediately with his machine gun.&nbsp; When he was ordered to withdraw, according to the citation, "he fearlessly covered the displacement of the machine guns to more tenable positions." &nbsp; "When the last gun was emplaced," states the citation, "he finally fell back to rejoin his section.&nbsp; Upon finding his section leader wounded and unable to move from his position, Sgt. Wireman called for supporting fire. &nbsp; "Ignoring the intense hail of enemy fire," the citation continues, "he rushed couageously to his wounded comrade and carried him to safety. His selfless behavior and outstanding devotion to duty possibly saved the life of the section leader and greatly inspired the members of his unit."</p>

  <p><strong>Blast Claims Lives of Four Friday in David Mine</strong> <strong>No. 1</strong></p>
  <p>Four men died last Friday morning, July 28, 1967, deep within a mine at David in what has been described as the worst mine explosion in the long history of Floyd county coal mining.The dead: Shannon Turner, 46, and his nephew, Ancil Turner, 36, both of Garrett; William Bill Titlow, 56, West Van Lear, night sit foreman at the mine, and George Cavins, 56, of Sitka, Johnson county.</p>
  <p>All apparently died in one blinding moment as a spark of undetermined origin ignited methane gas in a section of No. 1 mine of Princess Coals, Inc. which had not been in operation since January 27. Time of the explosion was fixed at 3:45 a.m.&nbsp; Two company employees, Jean Webb and Ray Spears reached the bodies around 6 a.m. and all were removed from the mine by 8 a.m., it was said. The explosion, investigators said, could have been of electrical orign or the result of smoking. A safety lamp said to have been worn by the foreman, Titlow, has not been found, and this is regarded an important item in the search for the cause of the blast. The four men went inside the inactive mine section to recover a coal drill and were winching a Browning hoist along the mine tracks.&nbsp; They were in Section 8 right off the south main, and were at or near a point, 4 1/2 miles inside the mine, where the slope begins to reach a lower seam of coal.&nbsp; Apparently, the gas had escaped from a lower level to where the bodies were found in the upper workings. Willard Stanley, of the Kentucky Bureau of Mines and Minerals, said the body of Titlow was nearest the outside, that Ancil Turner was 100 feet farther inside, Cavins 30 feet ahead and that Shannon Turner was 70 feet farther.&nbsp; There was evidence indicating that some of the doomed men had travelled about six feet toward the outside before being overcome.</p>

  <p><strong>From the Herald-Leader 2-28-1988.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>CAUSE OF '58 BUS DISASTER STILL A MYSTERY</strong></p>
  <p>Crash that killed 27 left its mark on survivors</p>
  <p>Prestonsburg--The morning of Feb. 28, 1958 was cloudy and cold, but the pavement on old U.S. 23 above Lancer was dry. About 7 a.m., bus driver John Alex DeRossett began his usual route from Cow Creek to consolidated schools in Prestonsburg, stopping to collect students in the communities of Sugar Loaf and Emma. The bus would never reach the schools.&nbsp; It would plunge into Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, killing 26 students and the bus driver. The crash happened 30 years ago today and remains the worst school bus accident in U.S. history.</p>
  <p>DeRossett was on schedule.&nbsp; Unlike an older bus he had driven the day before--a bus one student described as having its rear emergency door wired shut--Bus No. 27 had just been serviced. About 8:10 a.m. , three miles east of Prestonsburg at the mouth of Knotley Hollow, DeRossett pulled off the main road where two 14-year-old freshman girls, Ezelle Pennington and Joyce Matney, stood hugging their books and waiting with six other students. Joyce, a band member, and Ezelle were best friends.&nbsp; both wore fashionably long skirts, bobby socks, loafers and sweaters.&nbsp; A week earlier, they had rdred identical Easter outfits.&nbsp; Now, they discussed a forthcoming Prestonsburg High School basketball game. With them stood Joyce Matney's little sister, Rita Cheryl, 8, who had blue-green eyes and reddish hair.&nbsp; Rita Cheryl was "a doll--the prettiest little girl that ever was," said Ezelle Pennington Copley, now 44 and a resident of East Point. The eight students climbed aboard.&nbsp; Someone asked Joyce Matney what her grandfather's pickup was doing "down there in the ditch line." About 200 yards down the highway, a pickup was mired to its axles in the ditch alongside the road.&nbsp; A wrecker driven by Donald "Dootney" Horn was maneuvering across the road to pull it out. Because the bus was almost full, Joyce and Ezelle took separate seats. Joyce and her little sister took seats near the front of the bus, while Ezelle found one near the back, a section routinely reserved for older boys. As DeRossett changed gears, Janice Blackburn, 14, sitting with her feet against the top of a rear wheel well, loked up from her book.&nbsp; She saw Horn's wrecker and went back to reading. In the back of the bus, the older boys spotted the wrecker and someone predicted the bus would hit it, said Donald Dillon&nbsp; of Prestonsburg, who was an eighth grader.&nbsp; "He had plenty of time to stop if he'd wanted to. Dillon does not recall a collision.&nbsp; But Isaac Vanderpool, then 17, who was sitting behind the driver, said that DeRossett yelled when the bus struck the wrecker's left rear bumper and fender. Aroused students began screaming, too, when the bus turned a hard left and started toward the river, striking a parked car and narrowly missing a trailor owned by Bennie Blackburn, Ezelle Pennington Copley remembers watching Blackburn's trailor flash by as the bus slid head-first down the riverbank. "I remember thinking, "We're going to hit the trees any second," she said.&nbsp;</p>
