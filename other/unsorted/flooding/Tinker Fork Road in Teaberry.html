      <b><font size="4">Pike man dies in Friday flooding</font></b>
      <p>A Pike County man was killed and a woman was missing after torrential
      rains and flash flooding Friday evening throughout Eastern Kentucky left
      roads impassable and stranded people in their homes and vehicles,
      authorities said. <b>Leslie Howell Jr., 31, of Coon Branch</b> near
      Pikeville, died when his four-wheel all-terrain vehicle stalled and turned
      over, and he was swept down Hurricane Creek near Pikeville around 10 p.m.,
      police said. Kentucky State Police Sgt. Lynn Cross of Pikeville’s Post 9
      said Howell and another man were riding an ATV in the area when they tried
      to cross a flooded roadway. When they were unable to cross, the men
      panicked, Cross said, and jumped off the vehicles. Witnesses said when
      Howell attempted to recover one of the vehicles, he was overcome by
      swiftly moving water and pulled under. Howell’s body was found
      downstream an hour later, and resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful,
      police said. He was pronounced dead by Pike Coroner Charles Morris at
      Pikeville Methodist Hospital. Morris said results of an autopsy on Howell’s
      body are pending. The fire department was still looking for a woman who
      was swept away by waters after she exited her vehicle. Police had not
      revealed the woman’s identity officially, as os presstime. The woman had
      exited her vehicle, which had stalled just before 11 p.m. Friday night in
      high water from flooding on Indian Creek. KSP Post 9 Sgt. Steve Slone said
      police were continuing to search many still-swelled area waterways late
      yesterday afternoon for the woman. “We’re not assuming that she’s
      dead, we’re just trying to find her,” Cross said. Slone said police
      had contacted family members of the missing woman, but at their request,
      her identity was not being released to the media as of presstime yesterday
      afternoon. Slone also said he planned to work with area fire and rescue
      officials to develop a description of the woman to possibly aid in
      locating her. The storm dumped more than four inches of rain on the area,
      the National Weather Service said, while heavy rain was also reported in
      Letcher, Perry, Harlan and Leslie counties early yesterday. Pike
      Judge-Executive Karen Gibson declared a local state of emergency yesterday
      morning over Friday’s flooding, which she said was made worse because
      some areas have already been hit by other bouts of flash flooding several
      times over the past four weeks. Gibson’s office in the Pike County
      Courthouse was buzzing with activity yesterday afternoon as state
      emergency officials visited the county to begin preliminary inspections
      into the damage the flood waters caused. Present there yesterday afternoon
      was W.R. Padgett, director of the Kentucky Division of Emergency
      Management, who said some amount of state and federal assistance could be
      on its way to Pike to assist in repairs to roads damaged by the rushing
      waters. Padgett also said Gov. Paul Patton was to arrive at the Pike
      County Regional Airport yesterday evening to begin a tour of Pike and
      other Eastern Kentucky counties which suffered heavy flood damage. At that
      time, officials were to present Patton information collected yesterday on
      the flooding to assist him in determining how much flood assistance could
      come the county’s way, Padgett said. Some of that funding likely will go
      toward road repairs and damage assistance in the flood-sacked areas of
      Hurricane Creek, Robinson Creek and Kimper, which reported some of the
      heaviest flash flooding during Friday’s downpours. Little Robinson
      Creek, police said, still was closed off to traffic as of late yesterday
      afternoon. One resident who was stuck in the middle of one of the worst
      flash floods locally was Lois Ratliff. Ratliff said she woke to her
      daughter’s screaming Friday night. Ratliff then looked out her door, and
      saw a deluge of water rushing down Hurricane Creek. “It scared me so bad
      I started crying,” she said. Ratliff’s own home wasn’t damaged, but
      Hurricane Creek residents saw a night where their drain tiles and
      driveways were washed away, trailers knocked loose from their foundations
      and cars ended up submerged by the creek. One of her neighbors almost
      became another casualty, she added, when he tried to drive through the
      water. He was swept away, and if he hadn’t been pushed to a place where
      he could get out, he would have drowned, Ratliff said. “It was extremely
      terrible,” she said. “It still looks really bad here. The farther up
      you go, the worse it gets.” The same holds true for residents near Johns
      Creek, Stinking Branch, Kimper and Grapevine Creek, which also saw large
      amounts of water create muddy washouts and crumble blacktop to bits Friday
      about 9 p.m. “It’s a disaster of epic proportions,” said Johns Creek
      resident Johnny Daniels. “We’ve never seen anything like it.” “We
      need help in Johns Creek and Hurricane, and plenty of it,” said Jeanette
      Daniels. Hurricane resident Troy Slone said material from abandoned mine
      works had slid down the hillside onto the back of his mobile home, and
      behind that area and down the creek, the entire mountain is in danger of
      sliding into about three more houses. Massive mudslides already had pushed
      one mobile home from its foundation and into a nearby roadway there.
      Floodwaters in much of the area were beginning to recede by midmorning
      yesterday. Police reported a man in neighboring Floyd County was found
      yesterday after he was swept away by floodwaters and reported missing.
      Officials said Pike, Floyd and Perry counties were the hardest hit by the
      flooding, while Leslie, Harlan and Letcher counties suffered minor
      flooding. Patrick Conley, a spokesman with the Kentucky Division of
      Emergency Management, said Floyd County had also been declared in a state
      of emergency due to flooding on Mud Creek, Left Beaver Creek and several
      minor creeks. Conley said local officials reported the worst damage to Ky.
      979 in the Branhams Creek Road area. Early estimates, Conley said, showed
      that some amounts of water had affected as many as 200 homes in Floyd
      County. Four different shelters had been set up in the county to house
      those flooded out of their homes. Pikeville’s Post 9 had received at
      least 100 reports of people stranded in their homes or cars Friday night.

      garage at Grethel, Ky., Tuesday, Aug. 7, 2001. Casey was one of a group of
      volunteers from Southgate Baptist Church who came to eastern Kentucky to
      help clean up after the floods swept through the area. Flooding hit the
      state's coal counties when 4 to 5 inches of rain fell on portions of the
      region Friday and Saturday. (AP Photo/Rhonda Simpson) <!-- _JC_  END CAPTION -->
