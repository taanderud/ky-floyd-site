<h3> Who Owns Genealogy? Cousins and Copyrights </p>
    <p>by Gary B. Hoffman Introduction
</h3>
<p> The practice of genealogy -- researching and publishing information about someone's ancestors -- falls under the
    purview of intellectual property laws. Computers attached to CD-ROM readers and communications networks make it easy
    to compile information from disparate locations and then convey it to any point on the globe. Who owns a compiled
    genealogy? The one who compiled it? The one who possesses a copy? The one whose ancestors are the subject of the
    compilation? Anyone? No one?</p>
<p> This article does not purport to answer every question about copyright and related doctrines. Nor can it even plumb
    the depths of all the legal issues involved with the practice of genealogy. Rather, it should be taken as a
    launching pad for further discussions in intellectual property. It should definitely not be construed as legal
    advice. First, I'll define several terms related to copyrights, and then, I'll talk about how copyrights relate to
    you and your genealogy work.</p>
<p> Copyright Basics What is copyright? A copyright is an exclusive right to reproduce a &quot;work of authorship,&quot;
    to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies of the work, to perform the work, and to publicly display the
    work. A work of authorship must be &quot;original&quot; and must be fixed in a &quot;tangible medium of
    expression&quot; in order to be protected. As subject matter, genealogy generally falls into the &quot;literary
    works&quot; category of works of authorship.</p>
<p> U.S. Law. In the U.S., copyright laws derive from the U.S. Constitution which gave Congress the power &quot;to
    promote science ... by securing for limited times to authors ... the exclusive right to their ... writings.&quot;
    (Art. 1, sec. 8) Federal legislation preempts state laws on the subject of copyright. Copyright statutes are found
    in Title 17 of the United States Code, whose last major revision was called the Copyright Act of 1976.</p>
<p> Definitions. </p>
<p> As used in the intellectual property context, &quot;original&quot; means both originating with the author, not
    derived from another source, and novel or new, not previously known or expressed. </p>
<p> copyright law, the first definition is paramount; an author's work need not be different than another's, only that
    it is independently created by him or her. As Justice O'Conner has stated, &quot;The sine qua non of copyright is
    originality. ... Originality requires independent creation and a modicum of creativity.&quot;(Feist) The common
    explanation is that anyone can pen (and claim a copyright in) an exact copy of Ode to a Grecian Urn as long as they
    had never seen or heard Keats' poem.</p>
<p> A &quot;tangible medium of expression&quot; can be any method of recording &quot;now known or later developed, from
    which [the work] can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a
    machine or device.&quot; Spoken words are not tangible unless recorded. Ideas are never tangible and do not receive
    protection, but their expressions do.</p>
<p> When copyright arises. Under current U.S. copyright law, a copyright arises when a work is fixed in a tangible
    medium of expression. That is, it automatically comes into being when it is recorded in any fashion. The immediate
    owner of a copyright is the author, or authors in the case of joint authorship. Works created by employees of the
    U.S. Government and most state and local governments are not protected by copyright. Copyrights in &quot;works made
    for hire, &quot; that is, works created by employees as a part of their employment, are owned by the employer.</p>
<p> Transferring copyrights. A copyright may be transferred to another, as is commonly done when authors assign their
    rights in a work to a publisher in order to get the work published. A major part of the publishing and movie
    business concerns itself with buying, selling, and tracking copyrights.</p>
<p> Ownership of copyright. Ownership of the copyright is distinct from the ownership of any material object in which
    the work is embedded. Mere possession of a book, for example, or a CD-ROM, does not give the possessor absolute
    right to do anything they please with the contents of the book or CD-ROM.</p>
<p> Public domain. A work that is not copyrightable or whose copyright has expired or lapsed is considered &quot;in the
    public domain.&quot; There are no restrictions on what can be done with works in the public domain.</p>
<p> Term of copyright. Newly created works are protected during the author's lifetime and an additional fifty years
    thereafter. (Congress is considering a provision to add 20 years to this limit.) Works created before 1978 are
    governed by the law then in effect, generally for a total term of 75 years. In general, any work published before
    1922 is now in the public domain.</p>
<p> Not copyrightable. Certain expressions cannot receive copyright protection, either because they are not original
    (such as ideas, facts, events, news of the day, concepts, principles, Laws of Nature, or discoveries), or the domain
    of patent law (devices, procedures, processes, method of operation) or trademark law (names, titles, logos). If a
    concept can only be described in a limited number of ways, its expression is said to &quot;merge&quot; with the
    concept and is also not copyrightable. Also not copyrightable are blank forms, plain calendars, and lists or tables
    taken from public documents or other common sources.</p>
<p> Compilations. A compilation, that is, a collection of works, is itself a work that receives copyright protection
    whether or not the works it contains are copyrightable. The originality involved in compiling (selecting, arranging,
    explaining, etc.) the compilation qualifies it for its own copyright. Until 1991, compilers could assert a right in
    a compilation of public domain facts based on their considerable effort to compile them into a new work. But the
    Supreme Court threw out this &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; theory in its decision &quot;Feist Publications v. Rural
    Telephone Service,&quot; (499 U.S. 340). Since then, database owners have been forced to use other techniques to
    protect their market, including license agreements and moral suasion.</p>
<p> Fair Use. &quot;Fair use&quot; allows non-infringing copying of a copyrighted work for such purposes as comment,
    criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research. In determining whether such use is fair, courts
    consider whether the purpose is commercial or non-commercial, the nature of the work, the amount used in relation to
    the whole work, and the effect of the use on the market or value of the work. In general, copying a small amount of
    a work is considered fair unless it is the heart of the work.</p>
<p> You, Genealogy, and Copyright </p>
<p>The copyright laws affect both the research and the publication of your genealogy, either a narrative family history
    or a simple pedigree family line. First, though, consider that the basic facts about your ancestor's life (such as
    name, birth date and place, marriage partner, date and place, and death date and place) do not receive copyright
    protection, no matter their source. Whether you went to the county courthouse, rented a microfilm of the relevant
    records, or found the data in a commercial CD-ROM, the basic facts of a person's life may be freely copied; they are
    in the public domain.</p>
<p> But adding any kind of narration to these basic facts gives rise to a copyright in the creative portion of the work.
    The more narrative, the stronger the copyright. If you are the author, you should take care to mark your work to
    give the proper notice. If it is a large or major work, consider registering it and depositing a copy in the Library
    of Congress.</p>
<p> On the other hand, if you find narrative material in a good family source, you should take care not to violate the
    rights of the author. Remember the idea of &quot;Fair Use,&quot; mentioned above, before using more than a sentence
    or two, seek out the author and get permission. Do not assume that just because you have a copy of a story, you can
    copy it again or incorporate it into your family's history. If the author is dead, genealogists -- of all
    researchers -- are unable to use the excuse that they couldn't locate the heirs to seek copyright clearance!</p>
<p> Simple pedigree charts are not copyrightable, despite their markings, even when filled in with facts. But add a
    &quot;modicum of creativity&quot; and you can claim copyright protection in a pedigree chart. The same goes for
    computerized pedigree data, either in disk form or in a GEDCOM file.</p>
<p> Computerized family trees submitted to a compilation such as Ancestral File, GENSOURCE, the World Family Tree
    Project, or a GenWeb site are subject to the same laws of copyright as are printed genealogies. By submitting your
    data to one of these compilations, you implicitly agree to allow your information to be published. But if you
    include someone else's creative work along with yours, both you and the compiler may be liable for infringement.
    Broderbund Software warns contributors to its World Family Tree project about these issues in its WFT Instruction
    Guide, under &quot;Your Rights as a Contributor to the World Family Tree.&quot;</p>
<p> Copyright Formalities Although basic copyright protection is automatic, additional steps are required by law to
    either avoid fines or to receive punitive damages in an infringement suit. None of these is any longer a condition
    for copyright protection.</p>
<p> Marking. Marking a work with the word &quot;Copyright,&quot; abbreviation &quot;Copr,&quot; or the symbol � (the
    &quot;C&quot; in circle) plus the date and the author's name is permitted by law to provide legal notice of a
    copyright claim. In an infringement action, an infringer cannot reduce damages by claiming &quot;innocent
    infringement&quot; if the work was clearly marked.</p>
<p> Registering. The copyright law permits registration of the copyright at any time during its duration. Registration
    is required before bringing an infringement action at law. Registration involves filling a brief form, paying a
    small fee, and sending two copies of the work to the Register of Copyrights. For more details about this, visit The
    United States Copyright Office.</p>
<p> Depositing. Depositing two copies &quot;of the best edition&quot; of a work with the Library of Congress within
    three months of publication is a mandatory requirement of the copyright law. The copies sent to the Register of
    Copyrights for registration purposes fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p> Genealogy is a literary work under today's copyright laws. And everyone involved in research and preparation of a
    genealogy should be aware of copyright, as they use others' work for source material and generate their own.

<p> Database Copyrights</p>
<p> By Edmund B. Burke Sequence: Volume 30, Number 2</p>
<p> Release Date: March/April 1995</p>
<p> One question of continuing interest to users of computer technology concerns the extent to which computer databases
    may be protected by copyright. This question is important both to copyright owners, who want to maximize revenue
    from their databases, and to copyright users, who want to incorporate portions of databases into their own systems.
    In legal terms the issue revolves around the extent of copyright in a compilation. A compilation is essentially a
    collection of facts that is ordered by logical principles set up by the compiler. The facts are not copyrightable;
    the ordering and organization by the compiler is. Around that delicate distinction hangs many a tale. The Supreme
    Court decided the watershed case of Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service in 1991, which set the standards
    for later review for compilations. Feist marketed telephone directories that covered geographic regions wider than
    the region of any single telephone company. Feist asked for permission to use Rural's database, but Rural refused.
    Not willing to give up so easily, Feist copied (essentially verbatim and in its entirety) the telephone white pages
    which had been compiled by Rural. Rural sued for copyright infringement, claiming that while the names, addresses
    and telephone numbers of its subscribers were in the public domain, still the particular selection and arrangement
    of those names and numbers in its white pages was original and entitled to copyright protection. The Supreme Court
    disagreed. It observed that a certain amount of originality is required for copyright protection. While the
    threshold is low, the Court noted, a phone company's white pages fail to satisfy even the minimal standards
    required. Thus, the wholesale copying by Feist of the telephone white pages was held to be lawful. Users (or
    copiers) of computer databases tended to take great comfort in the Feist decision, on the theory that facts and even
    some elements of the structure from the database could likewise be copied and used without liability to the
    copyright owner. However, recent decisions from the Federal Courts of Appeal have indicated the narrow limits of the
    Feist decision. In BellSouth Advertising v. Donnelley, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
    copyrightability of BellSouth's yellow pages. The Court held that the greater degree of selection and organization
    employed by the editors of the yellow pages, when compared to the editorial decisions for the white pages, created a
    copyrightable work of authorship for the yellow pages. These actions involved selecting and naming advertising
    categories, dividing the directory into those categories, and assigning businesses to different categories. These
    were all deemed original acts of authorship which distinguished the yellow pages case of BellSouth from the white
    pages case of Feist. Therefore, the claim of infringement lodged by BellSouth against the copyist was upheld. A
    similar case was recently decided by the highly respected Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. In
    CCC Information Services v. Maclean Hunter Market Reports, the Court of Appeals examined the copyrightability of
    Maclean Hunter's Automobile Red Book - Official Used Car Evaluations. The valuation figures assigned to different
    types of automobiles represented the editors' judgment of the value for vehicles, based on a wide variety of
    information and the professional judgment of the editors. CCC Information Services used the information from the Red
    Book, and incorporated that into a computer database. The information was "republished" along with other valuations
    from other sources. When customers of the Red Book began to cancel their subscriptions in favor of the CCC database,
    Maclean Hunter threatened the copyist with infringement, with the lawsuit close behind. The trial court ruled that
    the Red Book was not copyrightable under the standards set by Feist, as it was nothing more than a compilation of
    unprotected facts, which were not organized according to any particular original thought. The appellate court
    disagreed, and noted that the trial court had established too high a barrier for originality as a condition of
    copyright protection. The originality requirement under copyright is minimal, the Court of Appeals stressed. Many
    courts, when considering database compilations in the future, will now follow the reasoning of the Red Book case and
    will probably find that those databases qualify as copyrightable. The Court found that several indicia of
    originality could be found in the Red Book, including the division of the used car market into separate geographical
    regions, the manner of presentation of optional features, the adjustment for mileage (which was specified in 5,000
    mile increments), and the use of the concept of an "average" vehicle. Although the Court recognized that the
    underlying facts themselves are not entitled to copyright protection, the copyist in the Red Book case was deemed to
    have taken more than facts. The selection of the categories and the other editorial decisions made by the Red Book
    authors were sufficient to create a copyrighted interest in the Red Book. The Court noted that, in cases of
    wholesale copying, courts should be willing to protect "soft ideas infused with taste and opinion" of the editors
    and compilers. Many databases will pass muster as copyrightable under the rather liberal standards enunciated in
    BellSouth and Red Book. Therefore, database users should be careful about the extent to which database material is
    taken and incorporated into separate works and applications, especially if the copying is substantial and if little
    "re- organization" is done to the basic database. Although the defendants in BellSouth and Red Book were competitors
    of the copyright owner, it is important to recognize that competition is not a required element of copyright
    infringement and that non-competitors can be liable as well. However, if the work of a copyist competes with or
    displaces sales of the original database, even more caution is warranted, as the database owner will have a great
    incentive to assert a claim. These "compilation copyright" decisions will obviously affect the brave new world of
    multimedia, in which a variety of sources are collected by a single compiler for preparation of a new copyrighted
    work. The complexities that will be involved in obtaining appropriate copyright clearance for such multifaceted
    works will be enormous. These court decisions will tend to increase the complexity of the clearance process, because
    creators of new works will be advised that they cannot with safety simply appropriate large portions of "factual"
    databases. We can expect to see new market-driven solutions for these problems, perhaps similar to the blanket
    licensing schemes used by ASCAP and BMI for musical licensing or to the voluntary clearance plan operated by the
    Copyright Clearance Center. </p>
