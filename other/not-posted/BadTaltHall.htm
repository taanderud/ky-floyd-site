<font size="3">This is the story of my great, great uncle, the legendary Bad John Hall.&nbsp; John 
was born in 1882 near the forks of Left Beaver Creek and Otter Creek.&nbsp; Many 
stories about John have stated that he was born in Wheelwright, but in fact he 
was born in the area that is now know as Bypro, Kentucky, then known as Briar 
Bottom.&nbsp; Briar Bottom included the areas now known as Bypro and Wheelwright with 
a mailing address of Melvin, KY.&nbsp; John’s parents Lee Hall Sr. and Eliza Hall, 
lived in a one room log house and it was in this house that John was born.&nbsp; It 
has been told that when pregnant with John, (Bad John), there seemed to be some 
sort of mystic power that forced her to visit a hornets nest nearby.&nbsp; She said 
that she would get up early, build a fire in the wood cook stove, but could not 
begin to cook until she made a visit to this hornet's nest.&nbsp; The hornets never 
harmed her.&nbsp; When she had made her visit and rubbed the nest she would return 
home and start her chores.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">When John was born, it is said that his hair was matted just like that old 
hornet's nest.&nbsp; Later in life the disposition and temper of the hornet began to 
show up in John.&nbsp; He was a quiet and easy going man who would only defend 
himself when provoked.&nbsp; You could say anything you wanted to him, but don't try 
to harm him because like the hornet, he would sting with all his power and that 
meant sure death.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">Education in the mountains of east KY was very limited.&nbsp; The few people with 
more than a fifth grade education were hired as teachers.&nbsp; Marion Hall and 
Isadore Hopkins did most of the teaching at the head of Beaver Creek.&nbsp; They only 
held school when they wanted to--maybe four to six weeks at a time and never 
more than four months in a year.&nbsp; These terms were in late fall and winter, 
since farming was the only means of livelihood and it required the help of the 
whole family during the spring and summer.&nbsp; It was work or starve, leaving 
little time for formal education.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">John entered school at the age of seven.&nbsp; The school house was a one room log 
building near where the First Baptist Church of Wheelwright is now located.&nbsp; 
John's first teacher was Mr. Hopkins.&nbsp; John worked hard in school and soon 
became what we all know as the teacher's pet.&nbsp; By age twelve he had grown into a 
handsome youngest with soft blue eyes, wavy black hair and a pleasant smile; a 
boy with an attitude far from that of the hornet which was to dominate his 
temper later in life.&nbsp; John held his temper very well until the age of 
fourteen.&nbsp; </font> </span></p>

<font size="3">John's (and most everyone else’s too) lunch consisted of sweet milk and crumbled 
corn bread which he carried in a two pound lard bucket.&nbsp; There was no other 
method to obtain a lunch except bring it from home.&nbsp; On a warm fall day in 
October 1896, John was sitting on a rock near the edge of Otter Creek having his 
school lunch when one of the school bullies ran by and kicked his bucket into 
the creek.&nbsp; That's when the hornet took over and the trouble started.&nbsp; As the 
bullies (Joe and Lewis Little) started to run, John picked up a rock, threw it, 
and broke Lewis' rib.&nbsp; From&nbsp; that day on, John was harassed by these two 
brothers.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">As John grew stronger, the time came when he was able to handle either of these 
two in a fist fight (and there were many).&nbsp; This continued until John was about 
17; then they would both gang up on him.&nbsp; Finally, they decided to leave him 
alone after several serious outcomes.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">John had a job with Cole and Crane Lumber Company as a logger taking timber out 
of what is now known as Golf Hollow.&nbsp; Things seemed to be going along rather 
smoothly for a couple of years until John married the girlfriend of Lewis 
Little, America (daughter of Ode Little).&nbsp; After this marriage the war began all 
over again with new enthusiasm.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">The Little brothers saved money and bought themselves a silver-plated, 
high-powered rifle.&nbsp; In those days riflers were used for hunting as well as 
protection.&nbsp; Hand guns were not practical for hunting and were considered a 
luxury.&nbsp; John did not own a firearm of any kind so he stayed clear of the 
Littles.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">On September 2, 1903, the Little's decided to try out their rifles and scare 
John.&nbsp; On this day John and his wife went up the creek of what is now known as 
Branham Hollow, to help his father, Lee Sr. strip and tie fodder (blades of 
corn).&nbsp; While they were working in the barn yard where the fodder had been 
transported by a team of oxen, the Little boys, who lived about half a mile 
farther up the creek, showed up with their rifles.&nbsp; They began to fire them into 
the air and before they stopped, they were firing into the ground near John's 
feet.&nbsp; After they had their fun, they left. &nbsp;This incident proved to be the last 
of the fun for the Little boys.&nbsp; Afterward, John said to his father, &quot;Pap, this 
is all I can take.&nbsp; I'd rather be dead than live like this.&quot;&nbsp;

going to her father’s house when they heard someone shooting.&nbsp; Up the creek John 
and his wife met them, the Little’s, about 100 feet above where the old Branham 
store now stands.&nbsp; They passed each other and one of the Little boys made a few 
remarks.&nbsp; A few feet away, the Little boys turned around and, tot heir surprise, 
John, who had sensed something, had turned around also to face them.&nbsp; Lewis 
fired a quick shot and missed John, only cutting into the collar of his coat.&nbsp; 
John fired two shots and killed them both.</font></span></p>

his brother Melvin hid out in the mountains near his home, only coming out to 
see the Hopkins family, whom he trusted very much.&nbsp; Their home was located where 
the Wheelwright swimming pool now is.&nbsp; Their only visits to the Hopkins family 
were to get information about John’s wife and family.&nbsp; The Hopkins’ lived very 
well and always gave John a supply of food.&nbsp; It is said that while they were 
hiding out the spent many nights in the cemetery where the Little boys were 
buried.&nbsp; This cemetery was very close to John’s father-in-law’s house where his 
wife was staying.&nbsp; He said that he wanted to be as close to her as possible when 
she gave birth.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">Early in 1904, John left Otter Creek and went into Virginia (near Bristol).&nbsp; He 
had been told that there were a lot of timber jobs there and that he would be 
safe.&nbsp; John was accompanied by his brother, Melvin—not Marion, as has been 
mentioned in many stories about John.&nbsp; These two brothers worked at timber jobs 
in VA around what is now known as Big Stone Gap and the Gate City areas.&nbsp; In 
order to stay away from as many people as possible, they preferred to work in 
the mountains, falling and trimming trees.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">After a few months, word came to John and Melvin that were several men from 
Floyd County planning to come into Virginia to get jobs as timber men.&nbsp; On 
hearing this news, John and Melvin felt as if they should move on into 
Tennessee—near Bristol and Kingsport—to keep their identities secret.&nbsp; This time 
they were hired as mill workers.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">Once again, they settled down and informed their family as to where they were.&nbsp; 
This was done by writing to the Hopkins family under an assumed name.&nbsp; They had 
been working at the mill for only a few weeks when they received a letter 
informing them that their brother, Marion, had been shot by an unknown gunman 
and was in very serious condition (January 1904).</font></span></p>

<font size="3">John moved back to his mountain home, facing the danger of being killed.&nbsp; When 
the mid-winter weather seemed favorable, the Hall boys travel was made somewhat 
easier.&nbsp; It is known that they rode a log train into the foothills of Pound 
Mountain where they contacted some of John’s relatives, Big Ed Hall’s family, 
who provided them with transportation into Letcher County KY.&nbsp; From there, John 
and Melvin traveled through the mountains to the head of Left Beaver Creek, now 
known as Skull Hollow in Weeksbury and then on to the Hall Cemetery.&nbsp; It was 
after dark when they arrived at the cemetery and they saw a fresh grave near 
where one of their sister’s was buried.&nbsp; They knew they were too late to see 
their brother, Marion.</font></span></p>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">
<font size="3">It was still unsafe to visit their father, so they went to the Hopkins family 
home where they were informed of the death of their brother, Marion.&nbsp; They were 
also told that word had come out of Virginia that John and a friend had been 
hunting and that John had killed a turkey and that two men attempted to take the 
turkey from him, threatening John at gun point.&nbsp; The word was that John had shot 
and killed them both.&nbsp; John never confirmed nor denied this story.&nbsp; His only 
reply was “who can blame a man for defending himself or his friends.”</font></span></p>

<font size="3">Early the next morning, McKinley Hopkins loaded a pig into the family wagon.&nbsp;

<font size="3">John tried to get as much detail as he could about the death of Marion.&nbsp; There 
was not much, if any, true information to be found.&nbsp; Marion had been bushwhacked 
(shot in the back) in Otter Gap (head of Otter Creek) and he was alone at the 
time of the shooting.&nbsp; It was believed that Riley Little, a brother to the two 
that John had killed, shot Marion.&nbsp; There was no solid proof of this, but the 
revenge motive was there.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">As soon as John found out where Riley had moved to, he set out to avenge the 
death of his brother.&nbsp; He returned home late one afternoon and informed his 
parents that he had located Riley, but the only chance he had to shoot him was 
from the back.&nbsp; John said that he never killed a man without a reason and for 
sure never shot a man in the back and he wasn’t going to start now.&nbsp; Besides he 
wasn’t absolutely sure that Riley had killed Marion, so he decided to wait and 
see what time would tell.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">It was late fall of 1904, and John didn’t want to return to Virginia and face a

<font size="3">John and his father fixed a room in the loft of the old log home, to give John a 
place to hide when company came to visit.&nbsp; John stayed here under cover until 
late spring of 1905 when once again trouble found this young mountain man.&nbsp; 
Someone had let out the word that John was staying at his father’s home so the 
posse was on it’s way—not to apprehend John—but to kill him.&nbsp; Since he had 
gained the reputation of being a bad man, a wild man and a killer, the posse 
didn’t want to take him in—they wanted him dead.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">His brother Melvin was to play the role of lookout for him.&nbsp; On a late spring 
morning in 1905, Melvin was supposed to be plowing the garden while also being 
on the lookout for anyone he saw approaching the house.&nbsp; If he saw anyone he was 
to fire one shot.&nbsp; He heard horses stepping on rocks as they came up the creek 
bed.&nbsp; He ran to the end of the garden where he could a good view of the posse.&nbsp; 
His rifle fired twice.&nbsp; Once again, John was on the run—and he had to run fast!</font></span></p>

<font size="3">John was cleaning his guns when he heard the signal.&nbsp; He jumped from the lost 
and his pistol, which was in the holster of his ammunition belt, got caught on a 
peg. &nbsp;Not knowing how close the posse was, John left the ammunition and his side 
arm hanging there and ran up the ravine behind his house.&nbsp; He came out on high 
ground on his way to a barn located near to where he is now&nbsp; buried in Branham 
Hollow.&nbsp; As he approached the barn, the posse opened fire on him.&nbsp; Not once did 
they call for him to surrender as he tried to jump the fence surrounding the 
barn.&nbsp; Joe Cable shot the fence railing off directly under John’s hand, causing 
him to fall to the ground.&nbsp; Cable continued to9 fire as John crawled behind the 
barn.&nbsp; Once behind the barn, John realized that he did not know the man who was 
shooting at him.&nbsp; He called out and told him not come any closer and asked him 
to stop shooting.&nbsp; Joe Cable did not heed the call and continued his pursuit.&nbsp; 
That was a fatal decision for John fired from the corner of the barn hitting 
Cable in the heart.&nbsp; Cable spun around, too four or five steps and fell dead.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">The remainder of the posse did not know how many rounds of ammunition John had 
left.&nbsp; One thing they did know was that they had found a man who would fight 
back against all odds.&nbsp; Joe Cable died approximately 75 feet from where John is 
now buried.&nbsp; During the exchange of shooting about 25 rounds were fired.&nbsp; The 
horses belonging to the posse got scared and ran off.&nbsp; The posse had to leave 
the scene in a run to catch their horses.&nbsp; Had they known John had only two more 
rounds of ammo in his rifle, chances are they would not have left or there would 
have been three more dead men on this battle ground in Branham Hollow—two of the 
posse and John because he was not going to be taken alive and he was posed and 
ready to take two more of them with him.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">Cable and some more of the posse, maybe all of them, were from Pike County and 
they had no warrants for John (which was later proven in court).&nbsp; John, 
concerned that posse would return to retrieve the body of Joe Cable, decided to 
continue on up the mountain where he could safely watch their return and 
departure.&nbsp; </font> </span></p>

fire than a pot bellied stove on a cold December morning.&nbsp; It is said that when 
the posse came to get Cable’s body, they found it just as he had fallen.&nbsp; One of 
the posse asked why someone didn’t place a pillow or something under his head.&nbsp; 
John’s mother said that if he been home with his family where he belonged 
instead of here trying to kill her boy that he could have been sleeping on his 
own pillow.</font></span></p>

his kinfolk had been shot or injured.&nbsp; After being assured that everyone was 
safe, they said that you could see a sigh of relief and a small smile come 
across his face.&nbsp; He walked over to his mother and asked, “Mammy, why has so

grandfather, Moses Little).&nbsp; He was just about as safe here as he could ever 
hope to be because he was sheltered by his relatives, the Littles, Johnsons, 
Halls and Burkes.&nbsp; After residing there for a few months, John learned of the 
birth of his daughter, Elva, a sister to John Melvin.&nbsp; John was tierd of running

traveled down Abner Fork to Beaver Creek, then up Otter Creek until they reached 
his father’s home.&nbsp; John told his father that he was tired of running and that 
he was going to stay close to home until he decided as to what would be best for 
him to do.&nbsp; He said that if the law came for him in a peaceful way that he would 
go with them, but if they came a shootin’ like before, he would shoot back and 
more men would die.</font></span></p>

some of his uncles and cousins; Talt, Evan and Nick Hall along with Marion and

<font size="3">The posse came a number of times and there were sometimes as many as twenty 
men.&nbsp; They came in peace, always traveling the same road and searching the same 
places, knowing that they would not find John.&nbsp; John spent some time hiding out 
in the mountain ranges dodging the law, but this was not too much of a problem 
for him since the law wasn’t really interested in catching this mountain man,

to the law.&nbsp; He was accompanied to the court house by the Osbornes and

neither wanting to cause any more trouble between them.&nbsp; Had John not made the 
statement to his mother and father that he was tired of being pushed around by 
these two brothers, and had he not traded for a rifle on the same day of the 
shooting, and had John’s mother not been an honest woman and testified as to the

an area that I’m not going to venture into, because I don’t know enough about 
the facts to say what was really going on.&nbsp; I do know that John made the 
statement that no woman was going to keep him away from his friends, especially

Roberts sometime around 1910.&nbsp; To this marriage was born two children, Hatler 
and Gertrude some time after 1912.&nbsp; Belle died and I am not sure about the cause 
of death but I have heard it possibly due to childbirth.&nbsp; John wanted another 
wife to help raise the children so he married again.&nbsp; This time he married Kate 
Branham, early in 1913.&nbsp; Into this union was born two children, John Jr. and 
Gladys.&nbsp; Kate had a daughter, Sarah Mae, who was very young at the time of their

buy property in the head of Otter Creek.&nbsp; They began to cut and clear timber in 
preparation to build the town of Wheelwright.&nbsp; John moved his family back to 
Otter Creek and was hired by Elkhorn Coal.&nbsp; He helped clear land and fall timber 
until Elkhorn got equipment such as a sawmill and planer.&nbsp; John had gained 
experience running a saw mill and a planer while on the run in Virginia so this 
work was not new tohim.&nbsp; He was a good worker and soon became a favorite of the 
company officials.</font></span></p>

fences and the building of things that were necessary for developing the town of 
Wheelwright.&nbsp; Once this clean-up was completed and the building of houses, 
railroads, and opening of the mines had started, Consolidated Coal Company ran a

hired as the first wheelwright city policeman.&nbsp; Charlie Klein took Lee Jrs. 
place as foreman of outside mountains and clean-up.&nbsp; As the town grew, more 
people came:&nbsp; blacks and whites; Hungarians, Polish, Russians and

migrated into Wheelwright.&nbsp; He was also having more trouble than he felt he 
should have with a company foreman by the name of Reese and the young son of one 
of the mine foremen by the name of Elihew Mitchell.&nbsp; Elihew was mean and rough

arrested Elihew and put him in jail for a few hours and then released him.&nbsp; The 
next day Elihew entered the pool room again, making remarks that he was tired of

somewhat of a problem for John and Elkhorn, so the company transferred John to 
the repair shop near the opening of mine #79.&nbsp; He worked at this job for about a 
year and a half when one day he went tot the ‘head house’ where coal was dumped

by Emaline.&nbsp; Kate had John’s son, John, Jr. with her.&nbsp; As soon as Lewis learned 
who she was, he walked over to her and pinched the baby (John Jr.) and told Kate 
to “go home and tell the baby’s damn bad daddy who pinched him and made him cry 
and then see if his daddy was as bad and brave as everyone said he was.”&nbsp; I feel 
as if Emaline told sill of this incident and that Sill told John, but John never 
let anyone know about it and no one knew that he had been told about the 
incident until the Martin shootout was over.</font></span></p>

much larger business that he had anticipated because of all the people who had 
moved into Wheelwright.&nbsp; It became necessary to haul more freight and start 
making deliveries.&nbsp; On Thursday, February 22, 1925, he boarded the early morning 
train headed to Big Sandy Hardware to buy a two horse wagon.&nbsp; His plan was to 
buy the wagon on Friday, return to Auxier, KY on Saturday, to attend the funeral 
of one of his customer’s baby.&nbsp; This was the child of Jim and Eva McCoy.&nbsp; He did 
this and spent the night.&nbsp; On Sunday he went to the depot to catch the train 
back to Wheelwright.</font></span></p>

courthouse for the purpose of addressing the people.&nbsp; He had asked for this 
privilege two weeks ago and promised to roast his enemies in great style.&nbsp; When 
he appeared at the window, there was a tremendous crush on the outside of the 
courthouse lot.&nbsp; He surveyed the great crowd, much as a campaign orator does 
when he steps on a platform and every ear in that vast multitude was strained to 
catch his every syllable.&nbsp; For ten minutes he stood at the window, looking over 
the crowd and at the far away Kentucky mountains where his dead body was soon to 
be taken.&nbsp; He did not utter a word.&nbsp; His face was a study.&nbsp; There was a look of 
anguish, of utter despair, that fairly chilled the spectators.&nbsp; Twenty reporters

distorted face appeared at the window.&nbsp; He forced a smile and his lips parted.&nbsp; 
An upturned face just below the window caught his attention.&nbsp; He waved his hand 
and asked, “What my be your name?”&nbsp; The person addressed told him and he said,

<font size="3">The most celebrated trial ever held in Southwest Virginia or Eastern Kentucky,&nbsp; 
a country where lawlessness has been rampant for years, was brought to a close 
on January 30, in the conviction of Talton Hall of murder in the first degree. 
The jury took twelve hours to deliberate and when the verdict was announced, 
Hall rose to his feet, perfectly cool and collected.&nbsp; After he was taken to his 
cell he said to your representative that he was confident of getting a new trial 
and proving himself innocent of the murder of policeman Hylton, of Norton.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">The trial was held at wise courthouse, the county seat of Wise County, Virginia, 
four miles from Norton, the nearest telegraph station.&nbsp; All week the strange 
sight was seen in the little mountain village of a courtroom filled with and 
surrounded by a large body of men armed with Winchester rifles to prevent the 
prisoner from being rescued or lynched.&nbsp; Even the attorneys in the case had to 
appear heavily armed to protect themselves from or the other side of the 
opposing factions.&nbsp; For two days, a band of the friends of Hall, all from over 
the Kentucky line, seventy-five strong, lay in the woods in the vicinity of the 
village, awaiting an opportunity to sweep down upon the guards, the jail and 
courthouse, which commonly commands entrance to the jail, were filled armed 
men.&nbsp; One of the Hall men, sent into town as a spy, was arrested.&nbsp; The strong 
preparations made for their reception frightened off the gang.&nbsp; Notwithstanding 
the mob, it is probable that the verdict rang down the curtain on the closing 
scene in the career of the most notorious desperado living, and the man who has 
killed more of his fellow men than any of the many desperados that this region 
can boast.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">Talton Hall was born in Letcher County Kentucky, fifteen miles west of 
Whitesburg, forty six years ago.&nbsp; He grew up in an atmosphere reeking of crime 
and bloodshed, and if a mans surroundings have anything to do with his making, 
his inglorious death at the end of a murderer’s rope is not to be wondered at.&nbsp; 
His birthplace, a simple log cabin, is still to be seen on the banks of a small 
mountain stream, appropriately named Troublesome Creek.&nbsp; He grew up in the 
company of budding desperadoes and his opportunities for securing an education 
or in any way fitting himself for upright citizenship were scant.&nbsp; Among his 
boyhood companions were Marshall ‘Doc’ Taylor, now confined in the jail at Wise 
courthouse, Virginia, on two counts of murder in the first degree and ‘Devil’ 
John Wright, who has been charged with twenty seven murders and who to t he very 
last has been steadfast in his friendship with the doomed man.</font></span></p>

<font size="3">During the dark days of ’61 to ’65 there was a perfect reign of outlawry in all 
the mountain counties of Eastern Kentucky.&nbsp; The people were almost evenly 
divided on the issues of war, and on the home guards, as the little bands of 
bushwhackers, guerillas and outlaws were called, fought many a battle in the 
lonely valleys and on the wooded hilltops of this mountainous section which are 
not mentioned in any of the current war histories.</font></span></p>
