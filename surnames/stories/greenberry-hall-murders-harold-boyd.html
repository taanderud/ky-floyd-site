                        facing a murder charge. </p>
                    <p> Within two hours of his second imprisonment here he was indicted on a charge of wilful murderby
                        a special Grand Jury impaneled by Circuit Judge. C. B. Wheeler after the adjournment of the

                        According to evidence produced before the grand jury Saturday afternoon and also taken by County
                        Attorney Joe P. Tackett Sunday in the violnity of the killing, Hall, after procuring a shotgun,
                        went to the home of Johnny Hall, where young Boyd was attending a praty, and when within a few
                        feet of Boyd fired the contentsof the weapon into Boyd's side. </p>
                    <p>As the wounded man fell, it is said, he fired three shots at Hall, two of which took effect, one
                        bullet striking the slayer in the forearmand another in the fingers. Boyd lived 45 minutes after
                        being shot and before dying made a statement as to the circumstances surrounding the affair.
                    </p>

                        telephone and he and Deputy Sheriff M. T. Stumbo left immediately for the scene of theshooting.
                        There they were joined by three other deputies, Joe Sturgill, Basil Hamilton and Walker Hall.

                        Sturgill wired to Huntington for bloodhounds. The dogs arrived Saturday morning and immediately
                        took up Hall's trail, a maze oftracks along the creek bed and adjoining lowland. Though the
                        hounds had not actually sighted Hall, they were circling about his hiding place where he was
                        hiddenin the willows along the banks of the creek. He surrendered soon afterward without show of
                        resistance, asking only for protection. The capture was made at 1o'clock Saturday afternoon, and
                        at 2:30 he was in jail here. </p>
                    <p> The following men, empanelled as grand jurors shortly after Hall's arrival, here, returned the

                    <h4>GREENBURY HALL CASE GIVEN JURY THURSDAY MORN</h4>
                    <p>Jurors, Still Deliberating Thursday Afternoon</p>
                    <p>SELF-DEFENSE PLEA</p>
                    <p>At 2:30 o'clock Thursday afternoon the jury in the case of the Commonwealth vs. Greenbury Hall,
                        of Harold, charged with the murder of Edgar Boyd, had failed to reach a verdict. Though a
                        verdict may be forthcoming, those interested in the case anticipate a lengthy deliberation on
                        the part of the jury before a verdict is agreed upon. If agreement is possible. In presenting
                        it's case the Commonwealth offered proof to the effect that Hall fired upon Boyd without
                        warning, while the young man was attending a party at the home of a neighbor. </p>
                    <p> Boyd died almost instantly from a shotgun wound in the body. It was contended by the
                        Commonwealth that enmity entertained by the defendant toward Edgar Boyd and his father, Jerry
                        Boyd, led to the premeditated murder. The defense produced evidence, in substantiation of the
                        plea of self-defense, that Hall fired only after he himself had been fired upon. It was brought
                        out by the defense that Hall was shot through the hand and arm, and the defendant testified that
                        he fired at Boyd after revolver shots had been fired at him outside the house, where the party
                        had been held. A main issue of the trial was presented in efforts of both the prosecution and
                        defense to establish whether the shotgun or the revolver had been fired first. Evidence evoked
                        on this angle of the case was widely variant.</p>
