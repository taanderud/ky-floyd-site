          <p>Greenbury Hall was held guilty in the Floyd Circuit Court here last week of manslaughter by a jury from
            Pike county sitting in his trial for the slaying of Edgar Boyd at Harold, a few months ago and was sentenced

          <h4>Released From Jail Here, Hall Kills Edgar Boyd, 17</h4>
          <p>SLAYER AGAIN IN JAIL, NOW FACES MURDER CHARGE</p>
          <p>Special Grand Jury Is Told Hall Shot Youth without Provocation</p>
          <p>INDICTED SATURDAY</p>
          <p>Released Friday Afternoon at 3 o'clock from the Floyd County jail here, where he had been incarcerated on
            his failure to execute a peace bond of $10,000. GreenburyHall, 47 years old, of Harold, this county, eight
            hours later shot and fatally wounded Edgar Boyd, 17, a neighbor, and within 24 hours after he had been
            dismissed from the jail here was again jailed, this time facing a murder charge. </p>
          <p> Within two hours of his second imprisonment here he was indicted on a charge of wilful murderby a special
            Grand Jury impaneled by Circuit Judge. C. B. Wheeler after the adjournment of the extended September term of
            the Floyd circuit court. Refused bond, he was remanded to jail. According to evidence produced before the
            grand jury Saturday afternoon and also taken by County Attorney Joe P. Tackett Sunday in the violnity of the
            killing, Hall, after procuring a shotgun, went to the home of Johnny Hall, where young Boyd was attending a
            praty, and when within a few feet of Boyd fired the contentsof the weapon into Boyd's side. </p>
          <p>As the wounded man fell, it is said, he fired three shots at Hall, two of which took effect, one bullet
            striking the slayer in the forearmand another in the fingers. Boyd lived 45 minutes after being shot and
            before dying made a statement as to the circumstances surrounding the affair. </p>
          <p> Sheriff B. L.Sturgill here was notified of the killing Saturday morning at 1 o'clock by telephone and he
            and Deputy Sheriff M. T. Stumbo left immediately for the scene of theshooting. There they were joined by
            three other deputies, Joe Sturgill, Basil Hamilton and Walker Hall. After searching Hall's home and later
            trailing the fugitive tothe bed of Big Mud Creek, Sheriff Sturgill wired to Huntington for bloodhounds. The
            dogs arrived Saturday morning and immediately took up Hall's trail, a maze oftracks along the creek bed and
            adjoining lowland. Though the hounds had not actually sighted Hall, they were circling about his hiding
            place where he was hiddenin the willows along the banks of the creek. He surrendered soon afterward without
            show of resistance, asking only for protection. The capture was made at 1o'clock Saturday afternoon, and at
            2:30 he was in jail here. </p>
          <p> The following men, empanelled as grand jurors shortly after Hall's arrival, here, returned the
            indictmentcharging willful murder: N. Y. Beavers, Tom Dingus, Lee Harris, E. B. Brown, Jack Miller, John
            Banks, J. C. Hopkins, Andy Frasure, Kell Spradlin, B. F. Combs, W. B.Boyd, foreman, W. P. Mayo.The burial
            was made. Surviving are the ill feeling existing for some time between Greenbury Hall and J. J. Boyd, father
            of the slain youth. Hall was held in jail here.under evidence produced by the Elder Boyd who sought to place
            Hall under a peace bond. Besides his parents, the victim is survived by a brother and several sisters. </p>
          <p> Funeral Services were conducted Sunday afternoon and burial was made in the Hamilton Cemetery near Harold.

          <h4>GREENBURY HALL CASE GIVEN JURY THURSDAY MORN</h4>
          <p>Jurors, Still Deliberating Thursday Afternoon</p>
          <p>SELF-DEFENSE PLEA</p>
          <p>At 2:30 o'clock Thursday afternoon the jury in the case of the Commonwealth vs. Greenbury Hall, of Harold,
            charged with the murder of Edgar Boyd, had failed to reach a verdict. Though a verdict may be forthcoming,
            those interested in the case anticipate a lengthy deliberation on the part of the jury before a verdict is
            agreed upon. If agreement is possible. In presenting it's case the Commonwealth offered proof to the effect
            that Hall fired upon Boyd without warning, while the young man was attending a party at the home of a
            neighbor. </p>
          <p> Boyd died almost instantly from a shotgun wound in the body. It was contended by the Commonwealth that
            enmity entertained by the defendant toward Edgar Boyd and his father, Jerry Boyd, led to the premeditated
            murder. The defense produced evidence, in substantiation of the plea of self-defense, that Hall fired only
            after he himself had been fired upon. It was brought out by the defense that Hall was shot through the hand
            and arm, and the defendant testified that he fired at Boyd after revolver shots had been fired at him
            outside the house, where the party had been held. A main issue of the trial was presented in efforts of both
            the prosecution and defense to establish whether the shotgun or the revolver had been fired first. Evidence
            evoked on this angle of the case was widely variant.</p>
