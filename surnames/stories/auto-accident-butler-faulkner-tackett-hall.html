  <p>NEAR HUNTER</p>
  <p>Warrants Charge Hall</p>

  <p>--------</p>
  <p>Lives of three Floyd countians ,a 16-year-old girl and two men,</p>
  <p>were claimed as the result of a head-on collision of two automobiles,</p>
  <p>near Hunter, at 1:30 a.m. Saturday.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Dead:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Elizabeth Ann Butler, 16, of Drift, killed at the time of the</p>
  <p>crash.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Larry Faulkner, 23, of Drift, who died nine hours later at the</p>
  <p>Methodist hospital, Pikeville.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Wilburn Lee Tackett, 73, of East McDowell, almost instantly killed.</p>
  <p>State trooper Larry Hatton, who investigated the tragedy, said</p>
  <p>Raymond Hall was driving Tackett's car, a Pontiac, in the direction of</p>
  <p>Martin, approaching the Chevrolet driven by Faulkner on a straight</p>
  <p>stretch of the Left Beaver Creek highway between the Hunter bridge and</p>
  <p>the site of the old school there. He said it was indicated the Tackett</p>
  <p>auto veered across the center-line for no apparent reason.</p>
  <p>Three voluntary manslaughter warrants were issued for Hall, and he</p>
  <p>was jailed here by Trooper Hatton. Hall later was released under bond.</p>
  <p>Trooper Hatton said Hall, Tackett, Estill Newsom and Ger-</p>
  <p>(See Story No. 5, Page 6)</p>
  <p>(Continued from Page 1)</p>
  <p>man Stumbo apparently were occupying the front seat of Tackett's</p>
  <p>car. He said some whiskey and beer were found in the auto after</p>
  <p>Tackett's body was removed, abut three hours after the wreck.</p>
  <p>The body was wedged in, between the seat and panel of the smashed</p>
  <p>car. The auto plunged over an embankment at a culvert after colliding</p>
  <p>with the other car, coming to rest almost on its end, and so the victim'</p>
  <p>body could not be extricated until the auto was pulled onto the highway.</p>
  <p>German Stumbo was injured but not seriously, and Hall and Newsome</p>
  <p>escaped with minor hurts.</p>
  <p>Three persons, in addition to Larry</p>
  <p>Faulkner and Elizabeth Ann Butler occupied the other car, and two of</p>
  <p>these were seriously hurt. Crit Butler, 15, brother of Elizabeth Ann, is</p>
  <p>in St. Joseph hospital, Lexington, where he has been removed from the</p>
  <p>critical list, it was learned here Wednesday. Four-year-old Brenda</p>
  <p>Friend, daughter of the late Al Friend, and a cousin of the Butler girl,</p>
  <p>is partially paralyzed. James Mollet, f Drift, escaped without serious</p>
  <p>hurt.</p>
  <p>Funeral rites for Miss Butler were conducted Wednesday afternoon</p>
  <p>from the home at Drift of her parents, J.C. and Bessie Martin Butler, by</p>
  <p>the Rev. John W. Conley. Burial was made in the family cemetery. Besides</p>
  <p>her parents, she is survived by one brother, Crit, who was with her at</p>
  <p>the time of the wreck.</p>
