                    <h3>Two-Auto Collision Claims Three Lives Girl, Two Men are Killed Near Hunter</h3>
                    <h4>Warrants Charge Hall With Manslaughter; Released Under Bond</h4>
                    <p>Lives of three Floyd countians ,a 16-year-old girl and two men, were claimed as the result of a
                        head-on collision of two automobiles, near Hunter, at 1:30 a.m. Saturday.</p>
                    <h4>The Dead:</h4>
                    <p>Elizabeth Ann Butler, 16, of Drift, killed at the time of the crash.</p>
                    <p>Larry Faulkner, 23, of Drift, who died nine hours later at the Methodist hospital, Pikeville.</p>
                    <p>Wilburn Lee Tackett, 73, of East McDowell, almost instantly killed. State trooper Larry Hatton,
                        who investigated the tragedy, said Raymond Hall was driving Tackett's car, a Pontiac, in the
                        direction of Martin, approaching the Chevrolet driven by Faulkner on a straight stretch of the
                        Left Beaver Creek highway between the Hunter bridge and the site of the old school there. He
                        said it was indicated the Tackett auto veered across the center-line for no apparent reason.
                        Three voluntary manslaughter warrants were issued for Hall, and he was jailed here by Trooper
                        Hatton. Hall later was released under bond. Trooper Hatton said Hall, Tackett, Estill Newsom and
                        German Stumbo apparently were occupying the front seat of Tackett's car. He said some whiskey
                        and beer were found in the auto after Tackett's body was removed, abut three hours after the
                        wreck. The body was wedged in, between the seat and panel of the smashed car. The auto plunged
                        over an embankment at a culvert after colliding with the other car, coming to rest almost on its
                        end, and so the victim' body could not be extricated until the auto was pulled onto the highway.
                        German Stumbo was injured but not seriously, and Hall and Newsome escaped with minor hurts.</p>
                    <p>Three persons, in addition to Larry Faulkner and Elizabeth Ann Butler occupied the other car, and
                        two of these were seriously hurt. Crit Butler, 15, brother of Elizabeth Ann, is in St. Joseph
                        hospital, Lexington, where he has been removed from the critical list, it was learned here
                        Wednesday. Four-year-old Brenda Friend, daughter of the late Al Friend, and a cousin of the
                        Butler girl, is partially paralyzed. James Mollet, f Drift, escaped without serious hurt.</p>
                    <p>Funeral rites for Miss Butler were conducted Wednesday afternoon from the home at Drift of her
                        parents, J.C. and Bessie Martin Butler, by the Rev. John W. Conley. Burial was made in the
                        family cemetery. Besides her parents, she is survived by one brother, Crit, who was with her at
                        the time of the wreck.</p>
                    <p>Faulkner, who was graduated in 1960 from McDowell high school and was employed as a night
                        watchman, was a son of Mrs. Katherine Moore Faulkner, of Drift. He leaves his mother and three
                        sisters, Mrs. Joan Griffie, Goshen, Ohio, Misses Mary Ann and Peggy Sue Faulkner, both of Drift.

                    <p>Tackett, a retired miner, was a son of George and Elizabeth Akers Tackett. He was twice married,
                        first to Katie Moore and later to Rhoda Hall. Both preceded him in death. He leaves one son,
