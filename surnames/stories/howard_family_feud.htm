<br>
&nbsp; Charles, This is the story as it was told to me by my grandfather who<br>
was&nbsp; born in Harlan February 13, 1901. His name was Elbert Martin Howard. My<br>
father was born in Louellen (Harlan County) April 9, 1928 and they moved<br>
to&nbsp; Jefferson county Indiana in 1932. The town was washed away in a flood in<br>
the 30's and was moved up the mountain further. My great-grandfather's<br>
name was John W. (Washington) Howard and his father was Adrian Howard. <br>
According to them the first white child born in Harlan County was Sam<br>
Howard who was the son of Wicks (?) Howard. They, I believe were my<br>
great-great grandfather's great-grandfather and great-great grandfather. <br>
So much for the lineal history.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I understand it, John W. Howard's aunt or cousin's wife was<br>
working&nbsp; in her garden and three Turner's decided to stop and talk to her. She<br>
apparently was not interested in engaging in conversation with them and<br>
did&nbsp; not appreciate the topic and told them to get the hell out. They did not<br>
appreciate the rebuff and proceeded to beat her until she was unconscious.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was implied that there was more than a beating but I was to young at<br>
the time to hear the details. When her husband found her he contacted his<br>
relatives and they hunted them down and ambushed them killing all three. <br>
He was eventually arrested and was jailed until the trial. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; During the trial a number of the Howard's smuggled guns into the<br>
courtroom (there have been several sheriffs named Howard in Harlan) and<br>
used them to convince the folks holding him to release him. The Turner<br>
family was not too happy about the turn of events and formed a small<br>
troop to correct things. There were several Civil War veterans in both<br>
families.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Howard's got wind of the formation of this group and compiled a<br>
similar but somewhat larger company of men to meet them. They apparently<br>
had quite a shootout in which the majority of the Turner clan was killed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The remnants were hunted down and killed with a very few exceptions<br>
escaping into West Virginia. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There was never a second trial and as far as I know, never contact<br>
with a Turner again. My grandfather would not even speak to anyone named<br>
Turner even if they were not remotely related to the event. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to find some corroboration for this event but have no<br>
access to the resources necessary. If you know of anyone with access to<br>
the information could you please let me know. I would appreciate any<br>
assistance. I hope this has been helpful. Thanks, John M. Howard<br>
