                    <p>A Howard Family Feud <br>
                        </b>submitted by <b><a href="mailto:kelex@venus.net">John Howard</a></b><br> November 21,
                        1998<br> &nbsp; </p>
                    <p><br>
                        <br> &nbsp; Charles, This is the story as it was told to me by my grandfather who<br> was&nbsp;
                        born in Harlan February 13, 1901. His name was Elbert Martin Howard. My<br> father was born in
                        Louellen (Harlan County) April 9, 1928 and they moved<br> to&nbsp; Jefferson county Indiana in
                        1932. The town was washed away in a flood in<br> the 30's and was moved up the mountain further.
                        My great-grandfather's<br> name was John W. (Washington) Howard and his father was Adrian
                        Howard. <br> According to them the first white child born in Harlan County was Sam<br> Howard
                        who was the son of Wicks (?) Howard. They, I believe were my<br> great-great grandfather's
                        great-grandfather and great-great grandfather. <br> So much for the lineal history.<br>
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; As I understand it, John W. Howard's aunt or cousin's wife was<br>
                        working&nbsp; in her garden and three Turner's decided to stop and talk to her. She<br>
                        apparently was not interested in engaging in conversation with them and<br> did&nbsp; not
                        appreciate the topic and told them to get the hell out. They did not<br> appreciate the rebuff
                        and proceeded to beat her until she was unconscious.<br>
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; It was implied that there was more than a beating but I was to young at<br>
                        the time to hear the details. When her husband found her he contacted his<br> relatives and they
                        hunted them down and ambushed them killing all three. <br> He was eventually arrested and was
                        jailed until the trial. <br>
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; During the trial a number of the Howard's smuggled guns into the<br> courtroom
                        (there have been several sheriffs named Howard in Harlan) and<br> used them to convince the
                        folks holding him to release him. The Turner<br> family was not too happy about the turn of
                        events and formed a small<br> troop to correct things. There were several Civil War veterans in
                        both<br> families. <br>
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Howard's got wind of the formation of this group and compiled a<br>
                        similar but somewhat larger company of men to meet them. They apparently<br> had quite a
                        shootout in which the majority of the Turner clan was killed.<br>
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; The remnants were hunted down and killed with a very few exceptions<br>
                        escaping into West Virginia. <br>
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; There was never a second trial and as far as I know, never contact<br> with a
                        Turner again. My grandfather would not even speak to anyone named<br> Turner even if they were
                        not remotely related to the event. <br>
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to find some corroboration for this event but have no<br> access
                        to the resources necessary. If you know of anyone with access to<br> the information could you
                        please let me know. I would appreciate any<br> assistance. I hope this has been helpful. Thanks,
                        John M. Howard<br> &nbsp;
