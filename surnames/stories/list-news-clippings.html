        disturbance, She answered that Mack and the Newsoms were "taking the place". Boggs said if they did not stop, he
        would call the law, according to a report filed here. The Newsoms. who were said to have been drunk, made a
        threatening reply and fired two shots at Boggs, the report continues. He (Boggs) had a shotgun with one shell in

        uncaptured Thursday after contributing to one of the most sanguinary weeks experienced by the county in some
        time. After escaping into the hills immediately following the slayings, they continued to evade arrest as The
        Times went to press. In the meantime a charge of willful murder had been filed by the grand jury here against

    <p> Daniel R. Johnson, 65 year old, Left Beaver man, who was convicted in June, 1932 of the slaying of his daughter,
        Mrs. Tina Smith, at the Johnson home on Abner Fork a few months earlier, was granted executive clemency Saturday
        by Governor Laffoon, who commuted his sentence from five to one and one-half years, thus rendering him eligible
        for immediate release. Seven of the jurors who convicted Johnson, former Circuit Judge C.B. Wheeler, who
        presided at the trial, and Commonwealth's Attorney C.P. Stephens, who prosecuted Johnson, recommended
        commutation of the sentence, stating that the prisoner is an old man and his further confinement would serve no
        good purpose. Johnson shot and killed his daughter on the night before she was to have been taken to the
        penitentiary to begin serving a sentence given her in court here for the slaying of her husband.</p>

    <h2>Taken From A Special Edition Of The Floyd County Times During The Gulf War, Articles Pertain To Wwii And The
        Korean War </h2>
    <p>RELEASE OF JAPS' PRISONERS BRINGS JOY, HOPE TO COUNTY Floyd County had its intimate share in the nationwide wave
        of thankfulness arising with the news that American prisoners had been liberated on Luzon. One Floyd soldier was
        released in the heroic commando raid by American Rangers and Filipino guerillas last week which freed 513
        American prisoners, survivors of the Bataan's "March of Death" after the fall of Corregidor, and a nurse, a
        sister of a Floyd county man, was liberated a few days later, from San Tomas internment camp in Manila as
        McArthur's forces dashed into the capital of the Phillipines. The soldier now among friends and freed Jap
        cruelty is Pvt. Lawrence Robinson, son of Robert Robinson, of Wayland, and a member of the famed 31st Infantry
        whose survivors were taken from Corregidor on its fall as prisoners. The nurse is Lieut. Ruby Bradley, 37,
        Spencer, W.Va., sister of Smith Bradley, Prestonsburg, who was one of the 11 nurses taken prisoner on Bataan.
        Anxiously awaiting the day when word will come that their sons are released are Mr. & Mrs. W.J. Reynolds,
        Martin, parents of J.B. (Bud) Reynolds, a medical corpsman on Corregidor at its fall, and Mr. & Mrs. J.E.
        Walters, of Emma, parents of Seaman Wyman Walters, also taken prisoner on the Phillippines after his ship had
        been bombed. Letters received by these parents, however, indicate that their sons have been removed to the
        Japanese mainland. Another Wayland soldier, Fred Williams, was taken prisoner by the Japanese but died in April,
        1942, his father J.W. Williams, was notified. Father of Pvt. Robinson, a miner at Wayland, could not be reached
        for an interview, but The Times was assisted by Noble Hobbs there in gaining an insight into his reaction to the
        news that his son was safe and at last in a American hands. Mr. Robinson was notified by the American Red Cross
        in a wire from Lexington that his son had been liberated. He was characteristically reticent. "I didn't work the
        next day," he quietly remarked. Lieut. Bradley, the nurse freed from internment in Manila, has visited her
        brother, an employee of the Columbian Fuel Corporation here, several times. An Army nurse since she was
        graduated from Walter Reed hospital, Washington, D.C., 19 years ago, she was sent to the Philippines in 1938 and
        was superintendent of nurses at Camp Hay hospital in Manila at the time she deliberately remained behind to care
        for the wounded as the Japs closed in on the city.</p>
    <p>WIREMAN WINS HERO-AWARD IN RESCUE OF WOUNDED MAN </p>
    <p> A Floyd countian's heroism in rescuing his wounded section chief from a flaming battlefield in Korea has won for
        him the Army's Bronze Star. The decoration was conferred on Sgt. Roy Wireman Jr., son of Mrs. Hazel Wireman, of
        Wayland, for heroism in action against the enemy Nov. 30, 1950, near Sinchang-ni. He is a member of the First
        Calvary Division's 7th Calvary Regiment. At the time he earned the medal, Sgt. Wireman- then a private first
        class- was helping man a roadblock on a main supply route. A force of enemy troops, disguised as civilians,
        infiltrated through the battalion defense perimeter and were not disovered until they attacked Sgt. Wireman's
        roadblock. The citation accompanying the Wayland sergant's award tells that he opend fire immediately with his
        machine gun. When he was ordered to withdraw, according to the citation, "he fearlessly covered the displacement
        of the machine guns to more tenable positions." "When the last gun was emplaced," states the citation, "he
        finally fell back to rejoin his section. Upon finding his section leader wounded and unable to move from his
        position, Sgt. Wireman called for supporting fire. "Ignoring the intense hail of enemy fire," the citation
        continues, "he rushed couageously to his wounded comrade and carried him to safety. His selfless behavior and
        outstanding devotion to duty possibly saved the life of the section leader and greatly inspired the members of
        his unit." </p>

        the first Floyd countian officially reported as having lost his life. A fireman on the battleship Arizona, he
        was lost with his ship in the sneak attack of the Japs on Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941. The American Legion Post
        here later was named in his hnor. The brothers were sons of Walter Karr Bowling, Sr., who during World War I
        made 18 trans-Atlantic trips as a seaman convoying troopships to French ports. Thomas Edward was graduated from
        Prestonsburg high school with the class of 1947. He enlisted in the army last August. At the time of his death
        he was an automatic rifleman with the 25th division. Surviving besides his mother, are one brother, Robert
        Clifford, and three sisters, Mrs. Manis Gray, Billie & Stella Marie, all of West Prestonsburg. Reported woundd
        after having earlier suffered a wound returned to action was Cpl. Billy Arms, son of Mrs. Martha Arms, of East
        Point. Also wounded was Eckener Pandzic, of Wheelwright. Mr. & Mrs. J.W. Hayes of Hueysville, were notified
        recently that their son, Randolph Hayes, who was listed in December as missing in action in Korea, is now known
        to be a prisoner of war.</p>

    <p>Blast Claims Lives of Four Friday in David Mine No. 1 </p>
    <p>Four men died last Friday morning, July 28, 1967, deep within a mine at David in what has been described as the
        worst mine explosion in the long history of Floyd county coal mining.The dead: Shannon Turner, 46, and his
        nephew, Ancil Turner, 36, both of Garrett; William Bill Titlow, 56, West Van Lear, night sit foreman at the
        mine, and George Cavins, 56, of Sitka, Johnson county.</p>
    <p>All apparently died in one blinding moment as a spark of undetermined origin ignited methane gas in a section of
        No. 1 mine of Princess Coals, Inc. which had not been in operation since January 27. Time of the explosion was
        fixed at 3:45 a.m. Two company employees, Jean Webb and Ray Spears reached the bodies around 6 a.m. and all were
        removed from the mine by 8 a.m., it was said. The explosion, investigators said, could have been of electrical
        orign or the result of smoking. A safety lamp said to have been worn by the foreman, Titlow, has not been found,
        and this is regarded an important item in the search for the cause of the blast. The four men went inside the
        inactive mine section to recover a coal drill and were winching a Browning hoist along the mine tracks. They
        were in Section 8 right off the south main, and were at or near a point, 4 1/2 miles inside the mine, where the
        slope begins to reach a lower seam of coal. Apparently, the gas had escaped from a lower level to where the
        bodies were found in the upper workings. Willard Stanley, of the Kentucky Bureau of Mines and Minerals, said the
        body of Titlow was nearest the outside, that Ancil Turner was 100 feet farther inside, Cavins 30 feet ahead and
        that Shannon Turner was 70 feet farther. There was evidence indicating that some of the doomed men had travelled
        about six feet toward the outside before being overcome.</p>
