          <p>THE SIZEMORE TRIAL</p>
          <p>INTERESTING HISTORY BROUGHT TO MIND BY IT</p>
          <p>KNOXVILLE JOURNAL, January 30th: The SIZEMORE murder trial consumed the time</p>
          <p>of the criminal court yesterday. The testimony was all in by three o'clock</p>
          <p>and Mr. Charles NELSON opened on the part of the State. The argument will be</p>
          <p>concluded this morning. The trial of James SIZEMORE for the killing of Cicero</p>
          <p>JOHNSON, in May, 1891, recalls some interesting events that occurred in the</p>
          <p>dark days of terror that prevailed in the north-eastern counties of East</p>
          <p>Tennessee immediately after the close of the war. James SIZEMORE is the son</p>
          <p>of the notorious Bill SIZEMORE, who terrorized the people of that region by</p>
          <p>killing innocent and inoffensive people without even the slightest</p>
          <p>provocation, and there are many still living who will remember the bloody</p>
          <p>deeds charged up to Bill SIZEMORE and his gang of desperadoes. At the</p>
          <p>beginning of the war Bill organized a company. He was a secessionist, but the</p>
          <p>union sentiment was so strong that the company resolved itself into what was</p>
          <p>known as the federalist guerrillas. They never mustered in regularly but led</p>
          <p>a roving, foraging, independant military life. While Bill was the</p>
          <p>acknowledged leader he had two trusty lieutenants by the name of FOSTER and</p>
          <p>WILLIS. After the war Bill ------ became nothing else but regul--</p>
          <p>---peradoes, and people ------------tern counties were in---- of them. A</p>
          <p>thousand and one thrill---------- ------dents perpetrated by Bill SIZEMORE</p>
          <p>--------- his followers could be narrated, ------- few will suffice. At one</p>
          <p>time, near the close of the war, some federal troops at Rogersville had with</p>
          <p>them seven rebel prisoners. Bill and his gang came to town, and Bill himself</p>
          <p>strode into where these prisoners were and shot every one down with his</p>
          <p>pistols. It was these sort of cruel and bloodthirsty acts, contrary to the</p>
          <p>code of warfare, but excused at the time because of war, that fitted them to</p>
          <p>lead the desperado life after the war was over. It became a war between</p>
          <p>Bill's gang and peaceable citizenship, and one by one Bill and his gang fell</p>
          <p>by the wayside with their boots on. James ROGAN, who still lives and is a</p>
          <p>respected citizen, was fired upon one time, when a boy, by Bill SIZEMORE, who</p>
          <p>shot him simply because he was looking at him. At one time the bloodthirsty</p>
          <p>demon met a little boy on a bridge and told him he would have to die. The</p>
          <p>story is that the terrified lad fell at Bill's feet, gathered him about the</p>
          <p>knees, plead piteously for his life, but the boy was shot. This deed is said</p>
          <p>to have been the only killing for which Bill afterwards expressed any</p>
          <p>remorse. He said at night he frequently would feel this lad clutching him</p>
          <p>about the knees, and the sensation terrified him. After the war Bill settled</p>
          <p>in Rogersville and ran the town and community to his own will. He took</p>
          <p>possession of a hotel and opened it, and one day had words with a man on the</p>
          <p>hotel front porch. He backed the fellow up against the wall and pumped him</p>
          <p>full of lead. On the same day, or shortly thereafter, Ira WILLIS, one of his</p>
          <p>old war lieutenants came along and called Bill to come to him from a crowd in</p>
          <p>front of the courthouse. He said, "Bill, you seem to be running the town</p>
          <p>about as you please." Bill replied that none dared to interfere. WILLIS then</p>
          <p>said he guessed this sort of business had gone about far enough and that he</p>
          <p>had made up his mind to stop it himself and at the same time pulled down on</p>
          <p>SIZEMORE, shooting him squarely in the forehead. Bill fell foward and turned</p>
          <p>over on his back, his head next to the fence between them. WILLIS leaned over</p>
          <p>the fence and shot him again exactly through the same hole, although the ball</p>
          <p>made two holes in the back of his head. This ended the life of one of the</p>
          <p>greatest desperadoes in East Tennessee. WILLIS himself was afterwards waylaid</p>
          <p>by a man by the name of BURTON and mortally shot through the body with a</p>
          <p>winchester. He was riding and the horse ran away. BURTON followed up and</p>
          <p>found WILLIS lying by the roadside. WILLIS told BURTON not to shoot him</p>
          <p>again, as he was already dying, but BURTON said he was afraid he might get</p>
          <p>well and shot him again. The people of that county always believed WILLIS was</p>
          <p>hired to kill SIZEMORE, and it is known that a boy whom SIZEMORE knocked down</p>
          <p>once with the butt of a gun, sent WILLIS $5.00 of his hard earned money.</p>
          <p>Others sent him money also. SIZEMORE had a partner by the name of WILLIAMS</p>
          <p>who met his death in Knoxville. Officer BRIDWELL, of the present city force,</p>
          <p>was then on the police force. He had a warrant for WILLIAMS for</p>
          <p>horsestealing, and, finding him in a saloon, went in and told him so. While</p>
          <p>he was reading the warrant to WILLIAMS, the latter jerked his gun and shot</p>
          <p>BRIDWELL in the right eye, the ball coming out just in front of his ear. The</p>
          <p>officer was whirled clear around on his feet by the shot, and when again</p>
          <p>facing WILLIAMS, received another shot in the upper part of the same eye. By</p>
          <p>this time BRIDWELL had his gun out and WILLIAMS grabbed it, but the former</p>
          <p>shoved the muzzel against WILLIAMS' stomach and fired. The latter turned to</p>
          <p>run when the officer again shot him. WILLIAMS died a few days afterwards from</p>
          <p>the wound in the stomach. But the brave officer had the constitution of a</p>
          <p>lion and is as good a man to-day as ever, although few men would have lived</p>
          <p>through the same trouble. Mr. WADDLE, also a policeman at that time,</p>
          <p>afterwards found another gun in WILLIAMS' boot. WILLIAMS' partner, the father</p>
          <p>of the man on trial, was afterwards killed by one of his own relatives.</p>
          <p>Before WILLIAMS died he said that if he had succeeded in killing BRIDWELL, he</p>
          <p>would have been the fifteenth man he and SIZEMORE had killed. Referring back</p>
          <p>to the present trial of SIZEMORE, the defense consumed but little time in the</p>
          <p>examination of its witnesses yesterday. SIZEMORE took the stand and told his</p>
          <p>story cooly and deliberately. He admitted killing JOHNSON and his reason was</p>
          <p>that JOHNSON had been bullying around him and threatened to kill him and he</p>
          <p>had got tired of it and concluded to have it settled one way or the other.</p>
          <p>When they met at a secluded spot mutually agreed upon, he had his hand on his</p>
          <p>gun. JOHNSON had his coat off and as they met he threw his coat down and</p>
          <p>advancing on SIZEMORE told him to take his hand out of his pocket or he would</p>
          <p>make him do it. About this time JOHNSON reached into his back pocket and</p>
          <p>SIZEMORE presumed was reaching for his gun said, "Well, if that's your game,</p>
          <p>here's at you," and commenced firing. He testified that he shot at his heart</p>
          <p>and shot to kill. Willie SIZEMORE, the twelve-year old son of the defendant,</p>
          <p>was the only witness to the affair. The little fellow's testimony was given</p>
          <p>in a straightforward way, differing in but a few minor details from that of</p>
          <p>his father. He stated, however, that JOHNSON had procured a knife of some one</p>
          <p>at a saw mill. An affecting scene occurred. He broke down and commenced to</p>
          <p>cry, then the father and some of the family all cried.</p>
          <p>SIZEMORE FREE</p>
          <p>The KNOXVILLE TRIBUNE of the 2nd, Inst., says:</p>
          <p>James SIZEMORE, who killed E.C. JOHNSON near Concord last May is a free man.</p>
          <p>The jury returned a verdict of "not guilty" yesterday morning. Judge SNEED</p>
          <p>was very much surprised and he issued orders that none of the jurors in the</p>
          <p>case should ever serve again in his court. Judge SNEED'S order and the</p>
          <p>verdict created a sensation among the members of the bar and the habitues of</p>
          <p>the courthouse and were the talk of the day. EDITORIALLY THE TRIBUNE SAYS:</p>
          <p>It is such verdicts as that returned by the jury in the SIZEMORE case that</p>
          <p>encourages mob law...</p>
