        <strong>Old Fashioned Brown Sugar Syrup</strong> 2 cups brown sugar, packed 1 cup water Dash of salt 1/4 cup white corn syrup Combine sugar, water, corn syrup and salt in a saucepan and bring to boil. Cover and boil gently for 10 minutes, or until
        a thin syrup is formed. Keeping the pan covered prevents formation of crystals around sides of pan. Serve hot, or cool and put into covered jar in refrigerator. A maple flavored syrup may be made by using white sugar instead of brown in the same
        proportion. When cooking is done, add maple flavoring a little at a time until desired flavor is obtained. Submitted by Freida McGlothen Taylor Celina, Ohio &nbsp;

    <p><strong>Chicken and Slickers</strong></p>
    <p>My grandmother made Chicken and Slickers for Sunday dinner when I was a child.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Her name was Flora Rosenberg and she was born in 1889 and passed away in 1970.&nbsp; I still use this recipe, &nbsp;it takes a lot of time to make but my family loves it.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        Flora always said that she makes the slicker just like her mother made, so who knows how old this recipe is.&nbsp; I make a basic chicken soup, then add the slickers.
    </p>
    <p>Slicker recipe:</p>
    <p>5 Cups of flour</p>
    <p>2 eggs</p>
    <p>1 cup of shortening</p>
    <p>salt and pepper</p>
    <p>enough water to mix into a dough ball.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Cut flour and shortening until it's in very small particles.&nbsp; Mix in eggs and water and work it until it's smooth.&nbsp; Roll out the dough until it's about 1/4 inch thick, and I still use the shot glass she used to cut out round disc's about 1�
        inches across.&nbsp; I dredge each slicker in flour.&nbsp; Bring the&nbsp;soup to a boil and drop each slicker into the soup.&nbsp; Boil this for about 1/2 hour, the slickers will plump up just a little as they absorb the chicken stock.&nbsp;
        The flour will thicken the soup just a little, she always used a tiny amount of corn starch to thicken the soup to make it almost a stew consistency.&nbsp; These slickers are chewy and if you warm it up the next day they are full of chicken flavor.&nbsp;

    <p>Does anyone have Grandma's pie crust recipe?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Seems all "Grandma" ever did was measure in the palm of her hand, "use this much", or, "just about a dime in your palm" UGH!....so now no one really knows how much of anything really went into these masterpieces that Grandma so humbly threw to the table!
        The recipe I want is from the Depression era. The recipes today are flaky and great, but they're just not the same and they taste bland! Grandma's pie crust had the consistency of a cookie (not graham crust). There are no comparisons to Grandma's
        pies! shannan1@comcast.net

    <p>TAFFY</p>
    <p>
        I am trying to find a recipe for French Chewing, a wonderful pulled taffy that my aunt Alta used to make each winter when it was cold enough, but not much moisture in the air. It did not have vinegar in it. If properly made, it was wonderful. Some other
        people who made it during the same era (the 50's and 60's) didn't have the knack, and their products turned out sugary. My aunt's recipe was always perfect. We would wrap each piece individually in waxed paper, and store it in the refrigerator.
        When you took a piece out, it would be cool and would slowly warm up in your mouth as you sucked on it, until it reached a consistency that you could chew it (probably had something to do with the name French Chewing). The flavor was so sweet
        and delicious - like nothing available in today's world. I believe the recipe used parafin in it. She would start pulling it on the back unheated closed in porch off the kitchen, while it was still very hot. As the mixture would start to lighten
        up, I would go outside with her and help with the pulling. She was a strong woman, and I had to brace myself against the clothes line post, to keep from being pulled all over the yard. I would just hold on, and grab the middle every time she pulled
        it back to where I was standing. We would continue this until it was too hard to pull any longer. Anyone out there with the recipe, I would really appreciate it. Two hints for pulling taffy: don't wear nail polish and don't use any puller who
        has sweaty hands.

    <p>Looking for Info</p>
    <p>
        Many years ago I use to eat fresh green beans at my grandmothers. They always referred to them as greasy beans (they were dark green beans and the inside beans were dark..unlike half white runners). I'm trying to find out what the name of the green bean
        is. Also, a friends grandmother (from around Cumberland Lake area) made chocolate gravy and turnips that I loved. Does anyone have a recipe for the chocolate gravy? I've had turnips several times, but Kim's grandmother's tasted different than
        I have ever had. I know both recipes go back into the1800's. You can email me at PIGGCM@aol.com. Thank you, <a href="mailto:PIGGCM@aol.com">Carolyn Pigg</a>

        <strong>CANNED SAUSAGE</strong>
        <strong>contributed by <a href="mailto:bigun@eastky.net">Carol Howell McGlothen</a></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;Every year at hog killing time (usually around Thanksgiving) two or three hogs were always killed and put "away " for winter. All the meat was salted, smoked or canned . The following is a recipe for
        <strong>canned sausage.</strong> It was used for many years by <strong>Kate Swartz McGlothen</strong> . She was b. 1885 in Bath Co Ky. The pieces of pork was ground and seasonings added. This is when it became sausage. Then Kate would fry it in
        a huge pan till done. She then scooped it out and into sterilized jars, making sure to get grease in with each scoop. She then turned the jars upside down .The grease would run to the top of jar and when cooled it would seal the jar . When Kate
        would get ready to fix the sausage she would take some of the grease from the top and fry to warm the meat. GOOD EATING !&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p><strong>Mama's Cornbread</strong></p>
    <p>
        She was born at Betsy Layne,Ky.in June 1921 and died in 1984.I have watched her make this cornbread at least a thousand times as a child. I grew up at Wheelwright and left at the age of 14. I now live in Ohio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Begin with equal amounts of flour&amp;cornmeal,dash of salt&amp;dash of baking powder, Use buttermilk to stir up the batter,no eggs,nothing else.Use a black iron skillet with about&nbsp; 2 tablespoons of bacon grease in it.Let the skillet get
        real hot on the stovetop.Pour in batter and wait a few minutes until it frys a crust around the edges.Put in the oven with temp,of 450 to 500 degrees.Must bake fast to keep from drying out,bake for 20 to 30 minutes.This is really good hot with
        butter&amp;jam,enjoy!

        I have an old newspaper article I found in our cookbook that is entitled Corn and published in 1978. It describes food in the older days from the South such as pickled corn and beans and parched corn, pulled taffy and etc. . &nbsp; Laying apples and etc
        into a 3 foot hole and covering with hand rived white oak laid as shingles&nbsp; and covered with at least a 2 foot mound of dirt. Dig along side of the shingle to retrieve an apple. The earth against the apple made a tang&nbsp; no others ever
        matched.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one that really caught my eye me was one about "starvation bread."
    </p>
    <p><strong>Starvation Bread</strong></p>
    <p>
        To make it, use one Beech or Birch log. Saw as much into sawdust as possible, then shave the rest into fine shavings with a sharp knife or draw blade. Put these shavings and sawdust into water and boil for eight hours. Cool for eight hours. Repeat this
        until the wood is reduced to a jelly-like substance. Bake and use as cornmeal, which it tastes somewhat like. <strong>Pickled Corn</strong> Boil the corn just enough to set the milk. Put into a crock and pour on ( to cover ) 10 gallons
        of water with one and a half cups of course salt melted in it. Put a plate on top with a stone; then tie a cloth over the top to keep out bugs. Rinse through several waters, corn in sieve,&nbsp; and cook as for regular corn.

    <p><strong>Mom Huff's Apple Butter</strong></p>
    <p>
        As a little girl, we always made Apple Butter outside in a big copper kettle over a wood stove. Each of us would take turns stirring, trying to keep the hot applesauce from "popping" out on us. My grandmother, Margaret Sark Huff, was born and raised in
        Knott Co. After she married, she and my grandfather, Allen Huff, moved to Naples, KY in Greenup. Her Apple Butter was well known throughout the neighborhood. You could always tell if the Apple Butter was made by Mom Huff because it was a beautiful
        red color, not the dark brown color most of us associate with good Apple Butter. She used red cinnamon berries instead of ground cinnamon. I still use this recipe today; however, I sometimes "cheat" by starting with a large can of applesauce and
        also cook the mixture overnight in the crock pot. I usually add a teaspoon of ground cinnamon in the applesauce as well as the red cinnamon candies. Hope you will enjoy this recipe from my grandmother. Mom Huff's Apple Butter 8 cups tart apples,
        cooked (Rome Beauty, Macintosh, Granny Smith or Winesap are best) 5 cups sugar 1/2 cup red cinnamon berries 1 Tablespoon apple cider vinegar Quarter apples, take out core, leave skin on. Cook until soft. (I use pressure cooker. Add one cup water
        to apples and boil six minutes after control "jiggles".) Mom Huff cooked the applesauce outside in a large copper kettle on a wood fire. Drain cooked apples and put in a ricer. Run apples through ricer to remove peeling. (I place a bowl or cookie
        sheet under the ricer). Place applesauce in a large turkey roaster. Mix together with all remaining ingredients. Put in 350 degree oven, stirring frequently to melt cinnamon berries. Let cook down until it reaches proper consistency--about 2-3
        hours. Place in jars and then in a hot water bath to seal. Note: 1/2 bushel apples= 24 jelly jars of apple butter

    <p><strong>&nbsp;Slickers</strong></p>
    <p>
        I was looking at the recipe page for Floyd Co.&nbsp; Someone was looking for a recipe for dumplings called slickers.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Every Sunday we went to our grandparents for Sunday dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandmother, Fannie Mae Davis Preston (born 10-27-1907-died 3-24-1975) quite often made chicken & dumplings. She would fry chicken & make a pot of dumplings & gravy.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        She boiled the chicken parts (backs, wing tips) for broth.&nbsp;She would&nbsp;remove the parts & add dumplings to the broth. To make the dumplings,&nbsp;she cut up, flattened & floured biscuits (she in later years used the canned version) & dropped them
        into the boiling broth.&nbsp; They float to the top while they are cooking &nbsp;& if you allowed them to gently cook they&nbsp;were the "fluffy" style of dumplings.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        When my grandmother wasn't looking, my sister would always sneak in and stir them--when you stirred them they weren't&nbsp;as fluffy, they got semi hard & we called them slick runners. We (my&nbsp;sister & I)&nbsp;preferred them that way over the fluffy
        version.&nbsp; My grandmother used to "threaten" her with bodily harm if she stirred them.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we knew she was safe--it was always an idle threat!
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Could this be the type of dumpling they were thinking of?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        By the way--it's 40 years later & my mother now threatens my sister since she still stirs them for the slick runner variety.
