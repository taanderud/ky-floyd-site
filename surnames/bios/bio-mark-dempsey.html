                    <hr>
                    <p>Dr. Mark Dempsey, of Garrett, has been practicing medicine for more than 50 years,&nbsp; and has
                        formed strong ideas concerning the health problems of the nation, He is a man with frost on his
                        hair, a social-philosopher's mind, and the tender heart of a healer. He is a man who could have
                        gleaned a fortune from a medical practice but chose, instead. The rewards of giving people
                        healthy bodies in lieu of materialistic gains. Dr. Dempsey is a vigorous man, although he is 85.
                        He speaks in the clear, strong tones of conviction after considered thought. He is plain in his
                        beliefs: <br>(1) He is a New-Dealer Democrat, and makes no bones about it. <br> (2) He would not
                        allow one penny of state relief to people who smoke and drink. <br>(3) He believes that people
                        should have free medical care. <br>(4) He believes that the government should spend the tax
                        money on our own people instead of squandering&nbsp; it&nbsp; on&nbsp; "drunk Frenchmen&nbsp;
                        or&nbsp; grape-stomping Italians." <br> (5)&nbsp; Every man, regardless of who he is, should be
                        trained to do skilled work.
                    <p>Dr. Dempsey is a plain, working man who has more aspirations to serve his fellowman by his
                        medical knowledge than gain prestige and fortune. This story&nbsp; is being&nbsp; told about the
                        doctor.&nbsp; One patient, On being counted out a sizeable package of pills for his ailments,
                        was said to have told Dr. Dempsey had charged him only a dollar: "Doctor, you can't make any
                        money&nbsp; selling&nbsp; your&nbsp; medicine like this." The doctor shot back "Who in the @)#@
                        is selling this medicine? I know what I pay for it. The doctor is not One to take "sass"&nbsp;
                        But he is keenly sensitive to the sufferings of the unfortunate, and his heart brings him to
                        practice the philosophy that his mind dictates. These people didn't ask to come into the world.
                        Somebody has to take care of them.
                    <p>Only 2O%of the people in the United States can afford medical treatment the doctor said.&nbsp;
                        Dr. Dempsey and Mrs. Dempsey have made their home at Garrett since 1924 when Dr. M. V Wicker
                        employed him to help out in a medical practice connected with the Elk Horn&nbsp; Coal&nbsp;
                        Corporation around Garrett and Wayland. He is oringally from&nbsp; Logan West Virginia and is a
                        third cousin of Jack Dempsey the former heavyweight boxing champion of the world, the doctor
                        doesn't try to impress anyone with his famous Relative. "A lot of people are kin to Jack, he
                        observes.
                    <p> The doctor's favorite subject&nbsp; is medicine and human needs The&nbsp; scientist should take
                        over the health program. Then we'd get rid of the dangerous use of tobacco.&nbsp; I've seen
                        old-timers up and down these creeks chewin their cuds like old cows. Pretty soon they come to me
                        complaining&nbsp; about how numb their legs are. Their circulation is cut off. They get Burger's
                        disease. It plugs up the arteries in the legs and arms just like corks." Dr. Dempsey is
                        disgusted with the neglect of the people. When you meet the man&nbsp; is ready to talk of the
                        people's&nbsp; need to. become whole and become as citizens of this country. The doctor fears
                        that his views may be misinterpreted.
                    <p>He is an avowed enemy of totalitarianism of communism, Hitlerism or any enforced subjugation of
                        individual rights-but he can point out inequalities existing&nbsp; in our system of government
                        which might be corrected, he has said&nbsp; through courageous and&nbsp; honest&nbsp;
                        leadership. All classes of people regardless of who they are, should be trained to do skilled
                        work and be disease free. Our government seems to to take the attitude that, If you can't do
                        something for yourself then it won't be done. One man can't shoot a rocket to the moon. It takes
                        the experts, the specialists. It takes the collective effort on the part of the people through
                        the government.
                    <p>One person can't give an education to eliminate the illiteracy and the disease of our people.
                        Only the government and the scientists and the experts can do this." "I have practiced medicine
                        in more rich and poor homes than any other doctor in Eastern Kentucky. I have practiced among
                        the Negro, the Jew, the Italian, the Indian. They are all the same. The Negroes treated me
                        better than anyone has ever treated me. The people in the lower economic class are being
                        neglected. "The experts should treat them. They should be free of disease, should have free
                        medical service as they do in Great Britain or Russia." "No. I am not a Communist." But how do
                        we hope to compete with Russia? How do we compete with Russia when we have much ignorance and
                        illiteracy? You find ignorance worse in the city than you do in the country it hadn't been for
                        some ignorant senators, Franklin D. Roosevelt would have made great land reforms. He wanted to
                        irrigate the arid lands of our western states. Truman was a good president. too, before the
                        wrong men caught hold of him. "I hope to God that we get some statesmen who can&nbsp; deliver us
                        from our apathetic condition.
                    <p>"The doctor thinks that medicine has greatly improved over the years, especially in the
                        continuing trend of specialization. "But," he said, "I think that a young man should spend a few
                        years as a general practitioner. before he specializes. "Dr.&nbsp; Dempsey is not&nbsp; narrow.
                        Changing patterns do not scare him. In progress and betterment he finds the hope of the world He
                        said that he, as a general practitioner, can treat the ordinary diseases. He added that only a
                        specialist can do a specialist's work. Whether you agree or disagree with the veteran physician
                        about his Views, you can't say he doesn't practice what he preaches about affording medical aid
                        to the poor. Those who have known him all these years. who have seen him ride, horseback, across
                        the hills, over rough, muddy roads into neighboring Knott and Magoffin counties to minister to
                        the sick will vouch for him. Said one acquaintance: "I've known Doc Dempsey to ride a horse into
                        Quicksand, spend two days caring for a sick woman and ride back out with a sack of cabbage for
                        his fee. And it would have been all the same if he had got nothing."</p>
