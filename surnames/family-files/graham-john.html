                        was orphaned at the age of three.&nbsp; When he was 10 years old, he enlisted in the 8th
                        Virginia Regt, Continental Line, Capt. George Vallandingham;s Co., on 5 Oct. 1775. He began in
                        the early 1780's wandering over the mountains into western lands and becoming familiar with
                        lands of Virginia and Kentucky.&nbsp; In 1797 he laid out Preston's Station (now Prestonsburg)
                        for Col. John Preston.&nbsp; As early as June 27, 1797 Graham had completed the surveyeing of a
                        2000 acre tract, presently Emma, Calf Creek and Cow Creek, Floyd Co., Ky.&nbsp; It soon became
                        his own.&nbsp; In 1805 he moved his family to Emma and completed his home in 1807.&nbsp; He
                        established a general store at his home.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1815 he initiated a bank and began to

                        G. Johns, Oct 14, 1886: Richardson Ky, Dear Sir: It becomes my faithful duty to announe to you
                        the death of our Dear Mother.&nbsp; She died yesterday morning about half pafter ten oclock
                        after ___ a few days of suffering.&nbsp; The hand of affliction has again been upon us-but may
                        the good Lord who has thus afflicted us- give us strength in this hour of bereavement.&nbsp; The
                        family circle has been much devided evenly.&nbsp; She has left two little brothers and sisters
                        on earth to join a like number of Little Angels in heaven-Poor little Tommy is too young to
                        fully realize the great loss he has sustained, but he is greatly troubled and it would have
                        broken your heart to have heard him crying in the night-last night "I want my Maw".&nbsp; Little
                        Lizzie, of course feels more keenly our affliction, while Johnny and Emma are grief stricken and
                        inconsolable.&nbsp; We had hoped that you would get the telegram sent by Mr. Friend in time to
                        reach home before she died.&nbsp; She asked for you so often, but what is harder still-so will
                        have to bury her this afternoon as decomposition at this writing (9 am Sunday) is much
                        advanced.&nbsp; I would have given the world if you could have only been here before she is
                        burried.&nbsp; I cannot hardly endure the idea of doing so, but the decree of fate is inevitable
                        and kind friends say it will be impossible to keep her longer than this afternoon.&nbsp; I sent
                        to Paintville and bought her the nicest burial case I most ever saw-it is of Black Walnut,
                        finely finished, nicely and richly turned (?) and lined.It has large silver plated handles and
                        screws and a silver plate upon the lid upon which is inscribed these magic words "Our Mother"
                        surrounded by a floral wreath. I have have had her grave dug by the childrens side.&nbsp;
                        ___town, in plaine view from our dear old home, my house and office and&nbsp; Go_ Store and can
                        be seen from ever point coming into or leaving town.&nbsp; She will, thus as of now, be the
                        first to greet us upon arriving home and to wish us a mute farewell upon leaving home.&nbsp; I
                        am very anxious to have you to home as the children are to lonely now and lend you my horse
                        "Rock" to render your trip from the Railroad home as easy as possible.&nbsp; But while I am
                        anxious to have you come permit me to urge upon you the importance of your not over taxing
                        yourself to ride home in a few hours and your health is in bad condition and a forced ride might
                        proove dangerous. Josie and I have been of home since Ma got so bad and will remain and take
                        care of the children and thins until you reach home, and until we can get things arranged.&nbsp;
