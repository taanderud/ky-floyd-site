    <p><strong>1.</strong> JOHN1 BURKE<i>1</i> was born Abt. 1791 in Virginia<i>2</i>. He married MARY UNKNOWN<i>3</i>. She was born Abt. 1798 in North Carolina<i>4</i>.</p>
    <p>Notes for JOHN BURKE:</p>
    <p>It is purely my assumption from deducing information provided that John Wesley Burke is a child that belongs on this family page. In an attempt to find his parents and/or his family I came across the 1850 JC census provided online by Kayleen Lowe.
        In 1850 John Burke h/o Mary Unknown is listed in household #66 with a son Wesley whose birth date is Abt the same time as my John Wesley Burke. Also the place of birth as VA is the same. It is my belief that Wesley Burke listed in household #66,
        is the same person as John Wesley Burke and that he is listed as Wesley on the census because he and his father share the same name of JOHN. Also John Wesley did not marry until 1852 and therefore would most likely have been living with his parents
        in 1850.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The actual Census is as follows:</p>
    <p>Burk, John 59 Farmer VA</p>
    <p>Mary 52 NC</p>
    <p>Wesley 23 VA</p>
    <p>Charles 20 VA</p>
    <p>Tabitha 18 VA</p>
    <p>Mary 13 VA</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the 1844 JC Tax list there is a John Burk, listed. I can assume that this is the same John. The only other Burk listed at that time is Richard, whom is also the only other Burk in the 1850 JC census. This is my earliest listing for John in Johnson
        County, KY which was formed in 1843.</p>

    <p>Notes for CHARLES J. BURKE:</p>
    <p>I think it possible that this child was named after his uncle, Charles Burke whom died in April of the same year. Tragically enough this child would take on the same fate of an early death, dying at the tender age of nine. His namesake died at only
        22 years of age of smallpox.</p>

    <p>Notes for HENDERSON SMITH:</p>
    <p>In 1877 in Johnson Co., KY Sarah E. Burk married Henderson Smith. He was 28 and she was 18. In 1880 on the Johnson County census this family is seen as Lillbern Smith, 31 and Sarah E. Smith, 20. I think this is the same family because their ages match
        and so does his parents place of birth as seen on both the marriage record and the census record. Also this family is living in Precinct 4, Barnetts Creek in Household #98. Sarah's sister Susan Catherine and her husband are living next door in
        household #99.</p>

    <p>Notes for WILLIAM F. BURKE:</p>
    <p>It is my belief that William was bounded out at a young age. His father John Wesley Burke died or left home between 1860 and 1870. IN 1873 his mother Angeline remarried to Ephraim Ramey, who also died leaving her widowed again by 1880. In 1880 there
        is a Willie Burk living with the Thomas Horn family in Household# 164, Precinct 4 Barnett's Creek. He is listed as 15 years old and a Farm Laborer.</p>
