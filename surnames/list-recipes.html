                    <p> In many families, recipes are passed from one generation to another. Like so many of our family
                        traditions and family members, these recipes are forgotten along the way. Here are recipes to
                        bring back some happy memories of Sunday dinner at grandma's home.</p>
                    <p> If you have an old family recipe that you would like to share, please pass it along with as much
                        information about the person that made it (name, birth date, death date, interesting story about
                        the recipe, etc). Send recipes through Contact page.</p>

                    <h3>Chicken and Slickers</h3>
                    <p>My grandmother made Chicken and Slickers for Sunday dinner when I was a child.</p>
                    <p> Her name was Flora Rosenberg and she was born in 1889 and passed away in 1970. I still use this
                        recipe, it takes a lot of time to make but my family loves it. </p>
                    <p> Flora always said that she makes the slicker just like her mother made, so who knows how old
                        this recipe is. I make a basic chicken soup, then add the slickers. </p>
                    <h3>Slicker recipe:</h3>
                    <p>5 Cups of flour</p>
                    <p>2 eggs</p>
                    <p>1 cup of shortening</p>
                    <p>salt and pepper</p>
                    <p>enough water to mix into a dough ball.</p>
                    <p> Cut flour and shortening until it's in very small particles. Mix in eggs and water and work it
                        until it's smooth. Roll out the dough until it's about 1/4 inch thick, and I still use the shot
                        glass she used to cut out round disc's about 1� inches across. I dredge each slicker in flour.
                        Bring thesoup to a boil and drop each slicker into the soup. Boil this for about 1/2 hour, the
                        slickers will plump up just a little as they absorb the chicken stock. The flour will thicken
                        the soup just a little, she always used a tiny amount of corn starch to thicken the soup to make
                        it almost a stew consistency. These slickers are chewy and if you warm it up the next day they
                        are full of chicken flavor. </p>

                    <p>Taffy<h2p>
                            <p> I am trying to find a recipe for French Chewing, a wonderful pulled taffy that my aunt
                                Alta used to make each winter when it was cold enough, but not much moisture in the air.
                                It did not have vinegar in it. If properly made, it was wonderful. Some other people who
                                made it during the same era (the 50s and 60s) didn't have the knack, and their products
                                turned out sugary. My aunt's recipe was always perfect. We would wrap each piece
                                individually in waxed paper, and store it in the refrigerator. When you took a piece
                                out, it would be cool and would slowly warm up in your mouth as you sucked on it, until
                                it reached a consistency that you could chew it (probably had something to do with the
                                name French Chewing). The flavor was so sweet and delicious - like nothing available in
                                today's world. I believe the recipe used parafin in it. She would start pulling it on
                                the back unheated closed in porch off the kitchen, while it was still very hot. As the
                                mixture would start to lighten up, I would go outside with her and help with the
                                pulling. She was a strong woman, and I had to brace myself against the clothes line
                                post, to keep from being pulled all over the yard. I would just hold on, and grab the
                                middle every time she pulled it back to where I was standing. We would continue this
                                until it was too hard to pull any longer. Anyone out there with the recipe, I would
                                really appreciate it. Two hints for pulling taffy: don't wear nail polish and don't use
                                any puller who has sweaty hands. </p>

                            <h3>Mom Huff's Apple Butter</h3>
                            <p> As a little girl, we always made Apple Butter outside in a big copper kettle over a wood
                                stove. Each of us would take turns stirring, trying to keep the hot applesauce from
                                "popping" out on us. My grandmother, Margaret Sark Huff, was born and raised in Knott
                                Co. After she married, she and my grandfather, Allen Huff, moved to Naples, KY in
                                Greenup. Her Apple Butter was well known throughout the neighborhood. You could always
                                tell if the Apple Butter was made by Mom Huff because it was a beautiful red color, not
                                the dark brown color most of us associate with good Apple Butter. She used red cinnamon
                                berries instead of ground cinnamon. I still use this recipe today; however, I sometimes
                                "cheat" by starting with a large can of applesauce and also cook the mixture overnight
                                in the crock pot. I usually add a teaspoon of ground cinnamon in the applesauce as well
                                as the red cinnamon candies. Hope you will enjoy this recipe from my grandmother. Mom
                                Huff's Apple Butter</p>
                            <p>
                                <br>8 cups tart apples, cooked (Rome Beauty, Macintosh, Granny Smith or Winesap are
                                best) <br>5 cups sugar <br>1/2 cup red cinnamon berries <br>1 Tablespoon apple cider
                                vinegar
                            </p>
                            <p>Quarter apples, take out core, leave skin on. Cook until soft. (I use pressure cooker.
                                Add one cup water to apples and boil six minutes after control "jiggles".) Mom Huff
                                cooked the applesauce outside in a large copper kettle on a wood fire. Drain cooked
                                apples and put in a ricer. Run apples through ricer to remove peeling. (I place a bowl
                                or cookie sheet under the ricer). <br> Place applesauce in a large turkey roaster. Mix
                                together with all remaining ingredients. Put in 350 degree oven, stirring frequently to
                                melt cinnamon berries. Let cook down until it reaches proper consistency--about 2-3
                                hours. Place in jars and then in a hot water bath to seal. <br>Note: 1/2 bushel apples=
                                24 jelly jars of apple butter </p>

                    <h3> CANNED SAUSAGE</h3>
                    <p>contributed by Carol Howell McGlothen </p>
                    <p> Every year at hog killing time (usually around Thanksgiving) two or three hogs were always
                        killed and put away for winter. All the meat was salted, smoked or canned . The following is a
                        recipe for canned sausage. It was used for many years by Kate Swartz McGlothen . She was b. 1885
                        in Bath Co Ky. The pieces of pork was ground and seasonings added. This is when it became
                        sausage. Then Kate would fry it in a huge pan till done. She then scooped it out and into
                        sterilized jars, making sure to get grease in with each scoop. She then turned the jars upside
                        down .The grease would run to the top of jar and when cooled it would seal the jar . When Kate
                        would get ready to fix the sausage she would take some of the grease from the top and fry to
                        warm the meat. GOOD EATING ! </p>

                    <h3>Starvation Bread</h3>
                    <p> I have an old newspaper article I found in our cookbook that is entitled Corn and published in
                        1978. It describes food in the older days from the South such as pickled corn and beans and
                        parched corn, pulled taffy and etc. . Laying apples and etc into a 3 foot hole and covering with
                        hand rived white oak laid as shingles and covered with at least a 2 foot mound of dirt. Dig
                        along side of the shingle to retrieve an apple. The earth against the apple made a tang no
                        others ever matched. The one that really caught my eye me was one about "starvation bread." </p>
                    <p> To make it, use one Beech or Birch log. Saw as much into sawdust as possible, then shave the
                        rest into fine shavings with a sharp knife or draw blade. Put these shavings and sawdust into
                        water and boil for eight hours. Cool for eight hours. Repeat this until the wood is reduced to a
                        jelly-like substance. Bake and use as cornmeal, which it tastes somewhat like. Pickled Corn Boil
                        the corn just enough to set the milk. Put into a crock and pour on ( to cover ) 10 gallons of
                        water with one and a half cups of course salt melted in it. Put a plate on top with a stone;
                        then tie a cloth over the top to keep out bugs. Rinse through several waters, corn in sieve, and
                        cook as for regular corn. </p>

                    <p>My Great Aunt Lizzie (Elizabeth Ruggles-Curnutte) b. 1883 d. 1967</p>
                    <p> She was blind in her later life. I was fascinated to watch her cut corn off the cob "by feel".
                        Her fried corn recipe was a family favorite. </p>
                    <p> 4 ears corn...cut off the cob 1/8 cup sweet butter pinch sugar. Fry corn gently until about
                        done..sprinkle with a pinch of sugar and still to dissolve. </p>

                    <h3>Slickers</h3>
                    <p> I was looking at the recipe page for Floyd Co. Someone was looking for a recipe for dumplings
                        called slickers. </p>
                    <p> Every Sunday we went to our grandparents for Sunday dinner.My grandmother, Fannie Mae Davis
                        Preston (born 10-27-1907-died 3-24-1975) quite often made chicken & dumplings. She would fry
                        chicken & make a pot of dumplings & gravy. </p>
                    <p> She boiled the chicken parts (backs, wing tips) for broth.She would remove the parts and add
                        dumplings to the broth. To make the dumplings,she cut up, flattened & floured biscuits (she in
                        later years used the canned version) and dropped them into the boiling broth. They float to the
                        top while they are cooking & if you allowed them to gently cook theywere the "fluffy" style of
                        dumplings. </p>
                    <p> When my grandmother wasn't looking, my sister would always sneak in and stir them--when you
                        stirred them they weren'tas fluffy, they got semi hard & we called them slick runners. We (my
                        sister and I) preferred them that way over the fluffy version. My grandmother used to "threaten"
                        her with bodily harm if she stirred them. But we knew she was safe--it was always an idle
                        threat! </p>
                    <p>Could this be the type of dumpling they were thinking of?</p>
                    <p> By the way--it's 40 years later & my mother now threatens my sister since she still stirs them
                        for the slick runner variety. </p>

                    <p> Old Fashioned Brown Sugar Syrup 2 cups brown sugar, packed 1 cup water Dash of salt 1/4 cup
                        white corn syrup Combine sugar, water, corn syrup and salt in a saucepan and bring to boil.
                        Cover and boil gently for 10 minutes, or until a thin syrup is formed. Keeping the pan covered
                        prevents formation of crystals around sides of pan. Serve hot, or cool and put into covered jar
                        in refrigerator. A maple flavored syrup may be made by using white sugar instead of brown in the
                        same proportion. When cooking is done, add maple flavoring a little at a time until desired
                        flavor is obtained. Submitted by Freida McGlothen Taylor Celina, Ohio </p>
