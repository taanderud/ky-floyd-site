          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As in any research done on family history, a lot of records from the 1700,1800 and early 1900�s are not
            always accurate.� You can find names in which you know to be family, but, birth-dates, marriage dates, etc.,
            will not always co-inside with what information you have been given by relatives and friends etc.� The
            information in this book, is hopefully accurate.�</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I wish to thank everyone who assisted me to get this information, and loaning me pictures, birth records,
            etc.� The list is a big one, so I will thank everyone who helped me in this project.�</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In this lineage, we have BENTLEYS�, BOLLING, ELLIOTT, FRASURE,GAYHEART, HALL, HAMILTON, HOWELL, MOORE,
            NEWSOME, OSBORNE, POCAHONTAS, plus numerous others.�</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>An index is provided in the back of this book.� Also there is a name index, listing all the names to date,
            of the family.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Pictures are included with the genealogy; there are pictures in the back of the book, with an index.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Also I�ve included a page with an explanation of symbols and abbreviations.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I�ve also included some of my poems in this book.� As well as poems written by others.� I wish to thank
            those sharing their poems with me for this book.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Also, included is a brief history of some of the ancestors.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>There are also Family trees.� Family charts, and Charts showing direct lines.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>An explanation of how the Moores�, Bentleys�, etc. are related to Pocahontas.� As well as other family
            tie-INS.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I have put each family into a family grouping.� This will make it easier to follow.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Family Crests/Coat of Arms, are included also.� Along with explanation of meanings of the family coat of
            arms.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Pedigree charts are in the back of this book.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>A chart of the descendants of Pocahontas is in the back of the book, also.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This is the beginning of the history of the Moores�</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In researching the Moores�, I found so much information on all the family tie- INS to this family.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This may be confusing to you, but I hope that I have put it so that you can easily follow the lineage. This
            was very frustrating in getting all the names correct, and all the tie- INS� to the Moores�.�</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This was to be originally, direct lineage of the Moores�.� But with all the names and tie-INS, I decided go
            further with this genealogy.� It isn�t a complete genealogy. As some families aren�t complete.� This will
            give the main ancestors in the Moore lineage.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The first family that the Moores� tie back to is:� Jarva �Jarvey� Hall, son of� Syrus Masias Hall/Unisiah
            Smith, Masias was the son of Squire Hall, no further information on Squire.� Jarva�s wife was Elizabeth
            Elliott, also another tie-IN to the Moores�. As this Elizabeth Elliott was a great Aunt to Matilda Jane
            Elliott who married: John Hamilton, these are the parents of Martha Hamilton who married Harmon Moore.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Jarvey Hall, son of Syrus �Masias� Hall and Unisiah �Una� Smith.� It is said that this Una Smith is a
            direct descendant of Captain John Smith.� I have no documentation on this. So this is just guessing at this
            point.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Jarva, called �Jarvey� Hall came to Kentucky from Virginia around 1810, settled at the mouth of the Mink
            Branch on Big Mud Creek.� Jarvey married Elizabeth �Betty� Elliott, daughter of John Elliott/Mary Betty
            Powers.� Elizabeth is a half sister to Robert Shanklin Elliott who married Lurany Hamilton, they are parents
            of Matilda Jane Elliott who married John Hamilton, who are the parents of Martha Hamilton, this is how the
            Moores�, tie in to the Halls�.�</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Jarvey obtained a patent of old Virginia Land Grant on all of Frasures� Creek, with the exception of some
            small tracts.� All this land, he gave to his children, when they married., which in turn was given to his
            grandchildren and so on.� In 1810 when Jarvey first came to Mink Branch, he met and married Elizabeth
            Elliott.� The moved to Frasures� Creek and at that time he owned all of Frasures� Creek, with the exception
            of Neds� Fork, The Middle Branch, owned by Kelse Gayheart and the Bill Gayheart Branch.� He built his home
            and raised his family.� After the children were born, he lived on the Bill Hall Branch.� About that time,
            Sam Bentley b. 1824 came by, on horseback, from Letcher County, Kentucky and married Jarveys� daughter
            Mahalie �Haley.� Jarveys� daughter Virginia �Jenny� Hall, married W.S �Newberry Salsbury Osborne.� So this
            is the way the Bentley�s and Osbornes� families came into this family.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Halls� delighted in education as well as religion.� Town and Palmer Hall were superintendants of the
            Floyd County Schools.� Bert Hall was moderator of the Antioch Church, McDowell, Ky.� The Halls� and their
            kindred had carried on the church for over 100 years.� This was the Old Grace Doctrine, which, was taught,
            with Jesus Christ being the way, the truth and the life.� This information is from John M. Bentley, brother
            to Elizabeth �Bessie� Bentley, who married Robert Howell.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I started this research in 1983. So, if there is a family name omitted, it is an oversight, not
            intentional.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Somewhere about 1840, Sam Bentley b. 1824 came from Lecher County, Key, by horseback, crossing over rugged
            mountains and down the beautiful Beaver Valley, looking for adventure.� He stopped with the intention of
            just staying overnight, at Frasures� Creek, at Jarvey Halls� place.� There he saw the woman of his dreams,
            Jarveys� daughter Mahalia.� It was love at first sight for Sam Bentley and soon he and Mahalia were
            married.� They settled at the mouth of Hoods Fork.� Jarvey gave them all the land on the Branch.� Here they
            raised their family.� Then he moved to Carter County, Ky. And lived there until his death.� He is buried
            near Carter Caves, as are several of the kindred, buried there.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Sam Bentley/Mahalia Halls� daughter �Vina� married Harmon Newsome and after Vina died, Harmon married her
            sister Polly.� Samuel/Mahalias� son John Manuel Bentleys� son Samuel Bentley b. 1854 married Polly Jane
            Osborne, daughter of Jenny Hall/Newberry Osborne.� This is where the Pocahontas line comes in.� This Sam
            Bentley b. 1865, his daughter Elizabeth �Bessie� Bentley married Robert Howell, son of Joel Howell/Miranda
            Hall, daughter of Owen Hall, who is the son of Jarvey Hall/Elizabeth Elliott.� Bessie Bentleys� sister Elsie
            Bell Bentley married Robert Frasure and lived in Idaho., they moved there in 1915.� John Manuel Bentley was
            married five (5) times He was in the timber business, as a saw logger, and went down the Big Sandy River to
            Ironton, Ohio.� They lived on Simms Creek.� This is where Sam Bentley b. 1865 was born.� I mention dates on
            these Sam Bentleys� as; there are several Sam Bentley�s in this lineage.� But the lure of the mountains and
            the virgin timber business was still in his blood, so he bought a saw mill and went back into the timber
            business in Floyd County, Ky., with his brother-in-law Will Frasure.� The timber business was in the mouth
            of the Bill Hall branch.� By this time his six children were big enough to work and help out, and then
            family trouble began, a divorce and married again, more trouble, another divorce and then he married again
            to Elizabeth Frasure.� They were a happy couple, lived at the mouth of Honey Gap on Hoods Fork, and then
            Elizabeth died.� By this time his children were almost grown, and some were married.� He was still a timber
            man, and he went to Virginia on the Pound River, on a big job.� Took three rafts of timber to Catlettsburg,
            Ky., and sold it.� Next time he was heard from, he was in Bee Bee, Arkansas, married again.� Then he worked
            on a boat from Wabash, Indiana to New Orleans, La.� From there he went to Bay City, Michigan.� He then
            bought a little place in the vicinity of Circleville, Ohio and worked in the coal mines.� He got hurt in the
            coal mines and returned to Floyd County, Ky., stayed for awhile, then went to Carter County, Ky., where he
            died at the age of 76.� He was living with his son, Joe Bentley, when he died.� He was hurt in the coal
            mines near Athens, Ohio.� He was the person to bring the first wood cook stove to, Frasures� Creek.� Also
            bought the first sawmill to Frasures� Creek</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The year of 1830 or whereabouts, �Newberry� Osborne, came across the Cumberland Gap and Mountains from
            Virginia to Frasures� Creek and married Virginia �Jenny� Hall, Jarveys� daughter.� They settled in the head
            of the creek at the mouth of Buck Horn and there they raised their family.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Leland Moore, son of Harmon Moore/Martha Hamilton, worked in putting the railroad tracks through the tunnel
            in the mountain at the Breaks of the Mountain State Park, which borders Kentucky and Virginia.� He was 15
            years old at the time.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Buck Horn, etc, all are around the Breaks of the Mountain.� As the Moore�s came from Virginia, also.� Just
            across the mountain into Virginia.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This is the generation of the Halls� and their kindred whom at one time belonged to the Antioch Church on
            Frasures� Creek.� The Church was there soon after the Civil War, as told by kinfolk.� All the people in the
            community attended the church all the time.� The preachers at that time were:� Bob Vanderpool, Daniel
            Roberts, Whetsel Blair and Aleck Allen preached there from time to time.� John Hall was a leader in the
            church at that time and his children began to join the church.� Around 1900, the church split up and Tom
            McGowan, Bill Gayheart, Joel Howell, Rube Moore, Rural Martin and others built another church near the mouth
            of Bill Hall Branch and held services there.� The preachers were:� Jeff Reynolds Daniel Roberts, Wilce Hall
            and Tom Mosely preached on occasions</p>
          <p>Will Hamilton was the clerk.�� Some of John Halls� sons, began to preach. The church prospered until the
            Hall boys moved to Carter County, Ky., and Jeff Reynolds moved away.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>There were several of the Hall boys in politics and the wars.� Listed below are a few, that were in the
            military, as well as others.� I didn�t have time to research each one that served in the military.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Owen Hall, son of Jarvey Hall was the only one of the Hall boys that volunteered in the Union Army.� The
            other Hall boys acted as scouts, in hiding their cattle in the hills, so the Rebels couldn�t take them.� The
            Rebels took John Halls� big mule and a big pinto mare and hid them.� He got them back after the war was
            over, but had to go to Old Virginia to get them.� Harmon Hall, his cousin, was another volunteer in the 39th
            Infantry, Union Army.� He went with John Hall to Virginia to get the mule and mare.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>John Hall b. 1835 married Nancy Stumbo b. 1858 d/o Frederick Stumbo/Nancy Jane Thornsberry (Full Blood
            Cherokee Indian of the Black hawk Tribe.)� John Hall is son of Jarvey Hall/Elizabeth Elliott.� Their
            daughter Sallie Hall married Evan Frasure and their son Robert Silas Frasure married Alice Hobson, and their
            daughter Anna Frasure married Charles �Charley� Moore s/o Harmon Moore/Martha Hamilton.� Another tie-IN, to

          <p>Pocahontas, the daughter of Native American Chief Powhatan, helped maintain peace between the Native
            Americans and English colonies in early America.� The English temporarily held her captive in 1613, and
            during this time she and Jamestown colonist John Rolfe fell in love.� Pocahontas converted to Christianity
            and married Rolf in 1614.� She received a royal welcome from the English, upon her trip to London in 1618.�
            While waiting to sail back to America, she became ill with smallpox and died.� She is buried in England.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Pocahontas (1595-1617) A familiar story about colonial days in America recounts the way in which
            Pocahontas, daughter of the Indian Chief Powhatan, saved the life of Captain John Smith.� According to this
            story, Powhatan�s warriors had captured Smith and were about to put him to death.� When Pocahontas pleaded
            with her father to spare him, Powhatan relented, and Smith was allowed to go free.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Many historians doubt that the incident took place.� Smith failed to include it in his first published
            account of Virginia, though he mentioned Pocahontas� visits to Jamestown.� Only much later did he include
            this story in his �General Historie of Virginia�.� But, even if Pocahontas did not save Smiths� life, she
            was instrumental in maintaining peace between her people and the early Jamestown settlers.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Pocahontas was a younger daughter of Powhatan, Chief of a federation of Algonquian Indian tribes who lived
            in tidewater region of Virginia.� Her real name was Matoaka.� The name Pocahontas means �playful one�.� She
            often visited Jamestown, and the settlers thought her a pretty young girl.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As she grew older, Pocahontas often brought food to the near-starving settlement.� She also warned the
            colonies of proposed Indian attacks.� While still in her early teens, Pocahontas visited a friendly tribe on
            the banks of the Rappahannock River.�� In the spring of 1613 Capt. Samuel Argall, who was trading for corn
            along the river, learned that she was nearby.� Somehow he talked the Indians into turning the girl over to
            him.� Argall took Pocahontas to Jamestown as a hostage.� Relations between Powhatan and the Virginians had
            become strained, and Argall hoped to use Pocahontas to negotiate a peace between them.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In Jamestown the settlers treated Pocahontas kindly.� She became a convert to Christianity and took the
            name Rebecca.� She met John Rolfe, a young widower noted as the first colonist to grow tobacco as a crop.�
            In 1614 he requested permission to marry</p>
          <p>Pocahontas.� Governor Thomas Dale, readily agreed.� Powhatan also was pleased by the proposal and sent an
            envoy to the wedding.� The couple were married on April 5, 1614, in the Anglican church of Jamestown.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In 1615, the Rolfes� only child, Thomas, was born.� The next year the family, with several Indian
            attendants, sailed to England for a visit.� The English were delighted with Pocahontas. The King and Queen
            received her at the palace, and the Bishop of London entertained her.� She also renewed her acquaintance
            with Capt. Smith, who had returned to England in 1609. During her stay in London, Smith revised the earlier
            version of his Virginia experiences to include the rescue story.� In 1617 the Rolfes prepared to return to
            Virginia, but before they sailed, Pocahontas contracted smallpox.� She died in March 1617 in Gravesend,
            England, and is buried there at St. George�s Church.�</p>

          <p><strong>������������������ WHY GOD MADE LITTLE GIRLS</strong></p>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>God made the world with its� towering trees,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Majestic mountains and restless seas.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Then paused and said �It needs one more thing.,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Someone to laugh and dance and sing.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>To walk in the woods, and gather flowers,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>To commune with nature in quiet hours.�</strong></p>
          <p><strong>So, God made little girls,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>With laughing eyes and bouncing curls.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>With joyful hearts and infectious smiles.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Enchanting ways and feminine wiles.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>And when He�d completed the task He�d begun.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>He was pleased and proud of the job He�d done.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>For the world, when seen through a little girls� eyes,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Greatly resembles Paradise.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>When Grandpa looks at Grandma,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Somehow he doesn�t see</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Her Wrinkled brow, her hair white now,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Her aged serenity.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>He doesn�t see her falter, when night</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Her voice seems firm and clear.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Her eyes that smile upon him are faded</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Blue and dim,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Though time has changed, they have</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Not changed, they look the same to him.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>When Grandpa looks at Grandma, forgetting</strong></p>
          <p><strong>She is old,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>He sees his bride cling to his side, with</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Hair of shining gold.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>He sees her in the splendor of love that</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Grows and grows.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>If she is bent and gray today,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Grandfather never knows.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>October in the middle of all,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The most beautiful month of all.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Leaves of red, scarlet, gold, brown and yellow.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>As they are turning subtly mellow.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The orange sun, arising.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>O�er the eastern horizon.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Gentle breezes, warm sun and azure skies.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>White clouds, like puffs of cotton, pleasing to the eyes.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Soft and soothing rain,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Blowing on the window pane.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A rainbow shining bright, o�er a cloud of blackish gray,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Emitting shades of pink, green and yellow, arched in such an array.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The trees in the woods, near a stream.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>With all its colors, is an Artists dream.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>When evening arrives and the sun sets,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The blood red sun, disappears into the west.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>We drove out west on a vacation.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The sights we saw in this great nation.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>To Mount Rushmore, we did flock.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Saw the presidents heads, carved on a big rock.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The Badlands National Park was so exciting,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Awesome, beautiful and also frightening.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The gorges we saw while looking down and around,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Amazing nature, with colors abound.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>On to Yellowstone Park we went.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Enjoyed Old Faithful and the time we spent.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Watching the geyser erupt, so high.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Spewing clouds of moisture, oh my !!</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The animals in the wild,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Roaming the fields, like a child.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Then later at Redwood Forest we arrived.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Such huge redwood trees, we espied.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Traveling thru Oregon and Washington, we saw,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>So many tall pines, we were filled with awe.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The Columbia River, a beauty, divine,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>With people fishing, and reeling in their line.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Winter, in December,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A special time to remember.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Glistening white snow on the ground,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Children on sleds, going up hill and down.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Making a snowman and building a sled ramp,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Throwing snowballs and getting damp.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>December is the Christmas season, so jolly,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>With decorated halls, windows and holly.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Hanging stockings by the fireplace, with yuletide wishes.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>For Santa to fill with candy and fruit, so delicious.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Presents wrapped, all around the tree,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Gifts for Mom, Dad, Sis, Brother and me.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A glass of milk, and a piece of pie tonight,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>For Santa to eat, and continue on his flight.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Sunny and breezy is what the weatherman said.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>I think he�s letting his job, go to his head.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>For cold and rainy it turned out to be.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The river flooded all around me.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>If the weatherman could get things straight,</strong></p>
          <p><strong>We�d know what to really expect, that�d be great.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>When he says its gonna be cold.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Expect the sun to appear, like gold.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>If he says sleet and snow.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>You can count on sunny skies and the wind to blow.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The meteorologists� association, he does belong.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>He can�t get fired for being right or wrong.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>It would be nice to have a job like this.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>For you won�t get fired, with a hit or a miss.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>���������������</strong></p>
          <p><strong>It�s time for all of us to change our ways.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>As we live in this world of sinful days.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Time on earth is almost at its� end.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>So, it�s time to start making amends.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Before it�s too late to change our ways of life�s perplexity.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Surrender to God, and pray for new life in eternity.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Praise Him with a humble heart.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>This is the way to start.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Obey his every word each day.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Kneel down to Him and pray.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Be kind to your neighbor.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Treat him like your brother.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Do for others, what they cannot do.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Help them to get through.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>You will most certainly have a place in God�s Throne, one day.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>In Heaven, with the master divine and his way.</strong></p>

          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Howell�s came to the United States from Wales as �Indentured Servants.�� They worked 6 years in North
            Carolina to pay for their passage.� He also mentioned �Blackhawk�, so I do not know just where it is, unless
            it is from the Cherokee Indians, �Blackhawk Tribe� or North Carolina.� This is an opinion, not fact.�</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>There was an ancient King named �Howell the Good� who wrote the first law book in Wales.</p>
