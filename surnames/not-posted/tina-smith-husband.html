                                married in 1923.&nbsp; They had one child (Arlen Johnson) (It should be noted that on
                                Arlen's birth certificate the name, Forrest Johnson is crossed out, and the name Arlen
                                Johnson written above it.). <p>Arlen was born on Jun. 26, 1925-(He told my mother-(Alpha
                                    Jean Johnson that he was born in 1919).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; James
                                    Johnson died in Jan. of 1926.&nbsp; He was reported to have been shot by Tina's
                                    brother-(Eli / not confirmed). The date of Tina's marriage to John Smith has not
                                    been confirmed. It probably occurred about 1927/1928.&nbsp; No children has been
                                    confirmed for this marriage. The attached picture has written on the back-(James and
                                    Tina / Sept. 23, 1923)</p>
