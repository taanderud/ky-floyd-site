                      <p>The community of Riceville gets it's name from Andrew Jackson (Black Jack) Rice. At one time
                        Andrew owned the whole of Riceville and Green Rock. About fifteen months after the death of
                        Pheobe. Andrew instructed his sons to look after the farm while he went away on business. When
                        he returned home they were some what dismayed to meet his new bride, their 1st cousin Nancy
                        Fairchild daughter of Phoebe's brother Eli W. Fairchild. On July 2, 1880 Andrew deed part of his
                        property for the foundation of the Sugar Grove Bottom School, perhaps the first school in the
                        Jennies Creek area. Andrew was said to carry his money in his saddle bags and at times they were
                        so heavy they could hardly be loaded on and off his horse. After the death of Andrew in 1884
                        Nancy remarried Andrew Hackworth.</p>

                      <p>Abiud Fairchild, George Blair, and John Hitchcock Sr. built a fort at the mouth of Big Mud Lick
                        Creek at what would be known as Staffordsville, Ky. Abiud had an "Indian dog" and he would go
                        around the vicinity of their encampment every morning to check for Indians.</p>
                      <p>George originally held a tract of land which would be known as the Stafford farm which
                        encompassed the south east quarter of Paintsville, Ky. He traded this farm for a vast tract of
                        land at Jennies Creek, Ky. which is the home of many Blairs to this day.</p>

                        bought a flock of geese. Her family thought she would never make it from North Carolina with a
                        flock of geese but Abiud had a hunting dog which herded the flock all the way to Johnson County
                        (Floyd County at the time).</p>
                      <p>Mary also brought bean seeds with her from North Carolina which were under great demand when
                        they reach the new country.</p>

                      <p>Notes for Abiud J. Fairchild:</p>
                      <p>Abiud enter military service as a drafted soldier in the Wilkes Co. North Carolina militia on
                        October 10th. 1778 at the approximate age of 16. Abiud served under Captain William Jackson who
                        would later become his father-in-law. Abiud's application for his Revolutionary War pension was
                        approved on March 4th, 1831 and he was placed on the roll for the State of Kentucky at a rate of
                        forty dollars per year. His name is posted on the statue commemorating the Revolutionary War
                        heros of Johnson County in front of the court house in Paintsville, Ky.</p>
                      <p>Abiud, George Blair, and John Hitchcock Sr. built a fort at the mouth of Big Mud Lick Creek at
                        what would be known as Staffordsville, Ky. Abiud had an "Indian dog" and he would go around the
                        vicinity of their encampment every morning to check for Indians.</p>
                      <p>Abiud developed a discoloration on the side of his face. The day he died, Abiud was visiting
                        his daughter. On his way to/from the barn, Abiud fell cutting this discoloration. The wound
                        would not close and Abiud bled to death.</p>
                      <p>Abiud is buried at the Patty Flats Cemetery in the Flat Gap area of Johnson County, Ky.</p>
                      <p>Notes for Rebeccah Jackson:</p>
                      <p>Rebecca died four weeks after giving birth to her only son Asa J. Due to the short proximity of
                        Asa's birth and Rebecca's death one tends to believe she died from complications to her
                        pregnancy.</p>
                      <p>Children of Abiud Fairchild and Rebeccah Jackson are:</p>

                      <p>Notes for Sarah Fairchild:</p>
                      <p>The story of James Curtis and Sarah Fairchild is a curious one. As legend tells one day James
                        went out to pick corn. When he came back twenty years had passed. In the mean time, Sarah
                        assuming the worst had gotten past her grief and remarried John Colvin. James Curtis wooed Sarah
                        mightily but she was unmoved and spent the remainder of her life as Mrs. John Colvin.</p>

                      <p><strong>70.</strong> <strong>Captain Henry Connelly,</strong> born May 02, 1752 in Chester
                        County, Pennsylvania; died May 07, 1840 in Oil Springs, Ky.. He was the son of <strong>140.
                          Thomas Connelly</strong> and <strong>141. Mary Van Harlingen</strong>. He married <strong>71.
                          Ann MacGregor</strong> 1774 in Guilford County, North Carolina.</p>
                      <p><strong>71.</strong> <strong>Ann MacGregor,</strong> born February 04, 1756 in North Carolina;
                        died Bef. 1830. She was the daughter of <strong>142. Archibald MacGregor</strong> and

                      <p>Notes for Captain Henry Connelly:</p>
                      <p>Henry Connelly was born and spent his formative years in Chester County, Pa.. His father Thomas
                        was frequently traveling and he was raised by his mother's family, the Van Harlingens. The
                        extent of their influence can be seen when in 1840 Henry applied for his Army pension. During
                        his deposition in Floyd County, Ky. the clerk states that Henry's speech is difficult to follow
                        due to his heavy Dutch accent.</p>
                      <p>Henry enlisted in the Colonial Army July 7th, 1777 in Guilford County, North Carolina. He
                        quickly achieved the rank of Captain and to this day is referred to as Captain Henry Connelly.
                        He was stationed in Charlotte, NC. under the command of General Nathanael Greene.</p>
                      <p>His first service came as he defended southwestern North Carolina against a Colonel Fannin, a
                        Tory in the Charlotte and Salisbury areas. In November of 1777 Captain Henry joined General
                        Benjamin Lincoln in Savannah, Georgia. In May of 1780 He fought in the Battle of Colson Mill
                        under General Davidson.</p>
                      <p>At the Battle of Charlotte, Captain Henry found his troops on the front line of the battle. The
                        first onslaught came from the British Calvary under the command of Lieutenant Banastre Tarleton.
                        Captain Henry held his line but twenty of his troops were lost.</p>
                      <p>The most famous battle which Captain Henry participated in was the Battle of Cowpens fought on
                        January 17, 1781. The American forces under the command of General Daniel Morgan. The Americans
                        had been on a retreat from the British forces. At a field outside Spartanburg, South Carolina
                        the Americans made their stand. They fought among the fences and empty cow pens used to herd
                        cattle. The battle lasts a little more than an hour. In the end, over 100 British troops had
                        been killed and were in a disorderly retreat. This was a major victory for the Americans and the
                        beginning of the end for the British rule of America. Henry's troops exhibited great valor in
                        battle and came to be known as " the Dutch Company " in honor of Henry.</p>
                      <p>After the war Captain Henry moved his family to Hager Hill, Ky. from Guilford Co., N.C. near
                        Winston-Salem. Here Henry and Ann McGregor lived out the rest of their years. After the death of
                        Ann, Henry remarried Temperance Blair Hitchcock. Many genealogists would question listing
                        Temperance as the sister of George and Noble Blair and I will admit the only proof I have of her
                        lineage is the oral tradition passed down through the Conley generations. I have a great deal of
                        confidence in my family's oral tradition. Temperance was the widow of John Hitchcock Sr.. She
                        was the mother of John Hitchcock Jr. who was the forefather of my grandmother Alma Conley's
                        generation of Hitchcocks.</p>
                      <p>Children of Henry Connelly and Ann MacGregor are:</p>
                      <p>i. Edmund Connelly, born June 02, 1775 in Guilford County, North Carolina; died 1865 in
                        Magoffin County, Ky; married (1) Lydia Joynes in North Carolina; born Abt. 1780 in Wilkes Co.,
                        N.C.; died Bef. 1850 in Johnson Co. Ky.; married (2) Nancy Tackett April 16, 1835 in Floyd Co.,
                        Ky.</p>
                      <p>Notes for Edmund Connelly:</p>
                      <p>Edmund settled at the head of State Fork Road of the Licking River in Magoffin Co., Ky. Many of
                        the Connelly clan in Magoffin Co. are descendants of Edmund. Note that while many Connellys in
                        Magoffin Co. believe to be of a different lineage from the Johnson Co. Conley's, in the vast
                        majority of the cases we are all descendants of Captain Henry Connelly.</p>
                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                      <p>ii. Thomas Connelly, born January 25, 1777 in Guilford County, North Carolina; died 1850 in

                        March 25, 1872 in Middle Fork of Jennie's Creek, Johnson Co., Ky.</p>
                      <p>Notes for Thomas Connelly:</p>
                      <p>When Thomas Connelly first came to Kentucky, he settled on the main fork of Jennie's Creek. He
                        later moved to a farm near the mouth of Miller's Creek on the Big Sandy River. This is what is
                        now known as the Powell Addition of Van Lear. A large oak stands on his grave.</p>
                      <p>Notes for Susan Joynes:</p>
                      <p>Susan lived to be 92. She wore a silver comb in her hair that was made from a silver bar found
                        in Blockhouse Bottom. The silver bar fed into the legend of the Swift Silver Mines. She was a
                        friend of Jennie Sellards Wiley. It is said that she was living with her son Henry at the time
                        of her death, however in the 1870 census she is living with her daughter Susan and her son in
                        law John Pyrtle Blair.</p>

                      <p>Notes for Constantine Conley:</p>
                      <p>Constantine is listed as a shoe maker in the 1870 census. He is, however, credited with
                        building the first hotel in what is now Magoffin County, Kentucky. Supposedly while at this
                        hotel, his son William Elsey was given a map to the Swift Silver Mine by a traveling attorney.
                        This started William Elsey's fascination with the legend of the Swift Silver Mine.</p>

                      <p>Constantine was the head of a large family. He was approached by General Humphrey Marshall.
                        While Gen. Marshall was talking with Constantine on the bank in front of his house, the
                        confederate troupes raided his barn, taking all his livestock. The Confederates went on down
                        Jennies Creek and raided the bee hives of Noble Blair who had his honey packaged for market.
                        Upon the protests of Noble the Confederates filled his bee gums with water. The Blairs are
                        mostly Republican to this day.</p>

                      <p>Notes for Dr. Isaac Rice:</p>
                      <p>Dr. Isaac Rice served as a physician in Johnson County, Kentucky. Upon the outbreak of the
                        Civil War, he volunteered for service in the Union Army. He served as a hospital steward for
                        most of the conflict. An often told story concerning Dr. Isaac concerns a time when he was
                        returning home from the battle field. He came upon an encampment of Confederate soldiers. He
                        turned his horse but not before he was spotted by the enemy soldiers. He galloped away, hanging
                        from the side of the horse opposite the whizzing bullets. Dr. Isaac and Celia's family is one of
                        the most respected in Johnson County.</p>

                      <p>Notes for Thomas Connelly:</p>
                      <p>The first notable mention of Thomas Connelly came in the service of General Braddock during his
                        ill fated march on Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).</p>
                      <p>Thomas Connelly was a traveling man, seeing to holdings as far north as Pennsylvania and as far
                        south as the ancestral family holdings in Charleston, SC.. According to William Elsey Connelly
                        in his history, The Founding of Harman's Station, in 1763, Thomas was in a party which explored
                        the Big Sandy Valley of Eastern Kentucky. Among the party members were, Thomas's brother Harmon
                        Connelly, Daniel Boone, Matthias Harman, James Skaggs, Henry Skaggs and others. They stayed for
                        six weeks near the mouth of Big Paint Creek in cabins long since abandoned by French explorers.
                      </p>
                      <p>In 1780 Thomas was in Charleston, South Carolina to consult with his attorney concerning land
                        held by his family in that city. Thomas was caught up in the battle for the city. When the city
                        fell Thomas joined in the army of General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.</p>
                      <p>Thomas went on to fight at the battle of King's Mountain on October 7, 1780. During the battle
                        Thomas was shot through by a musket ball. According to family legend Thomas was treated by a Dr.
                        Hicks who was the son-in-law of Thomas's brother Harmon. Dr. Hicks was half Indian and trained
                        in Medicine in France. As treatment for the wound, Dr. Hicks passed a silk handkerchief several
                        times through the wound.</p>
                      <p>Thomas died in 1783 as a lingering result of this wound.</p>

                      <p>Notes for Archibald MacGregor:</p>
                      <p>On April 6th, 1746, the Battle of Culloden was fought between 9,000 British redcoats and 5,000
                        weak and starving Scottish patriots, among them (Henry) MacAlpin, father of Edith MacAlpin and
                        Archibald MacGregor. This was the last battle of the "Forty-five rebellion". The Scots were led
                        by "Bonnie Prince Charlie", Charles Edward, the English were led by William Augustus, duke of
                        Cumberland. The battle lasted only forty minutes and was a complete rout of the Scots. Only
                        fifty Redcoats were killed as opposed to 1,000 Scotsmen. Among the dead Scots was (Henry)
                        MacAlpin. Archibald Macgregor survived the battle and was not captured. History teaches that in
                        the following five months, a massive manhunt was conducted throughout Scotland for the remaining
                        patriots. It has been speculated that during this time, Archibald and Edith MacGregor escaped
                        Scotland and set sail for America.</p>
