              <p>Notes for Abiud J. Fairchild:</p>
              <p>Abiud enter military service as a drafted soldier in the Wilkes Co. North Carolina militia on October 10th. 1778 at the approximate age of 16. Abiud served under Captain William Jackson who would later become his father-in-law. Abiud's application for his Revolutionary War pension was approved on March 4th, 1831 and he was placed on the roll for the State of Kentucky at a rate of forty dollars per year. His name is posted on the statue commemorating the Revolutionary War heros of Johnson County in front of the court house in Paintsville, Ky.</p>
              <p>Abiud, George Blair, and John Hitchcock Sr. built a fort at the mouth of Big Mud Lick Creek at what would be known as Staffordsville, Ky. Abiud had an "Indian dog" and he would go around the vicinity of their encampment every morning to check for Indians.</p>
              <p>Abiud developed a discoloration on the side of his face. The day he died, Abiud was visiting his daughter. On his way to/from the barn, Abiud fell cutting this discoloration. The wound would not close and Abiud bled to death.</p>

              <p>Notes for Sarah Fairchild:</p>
              <p>The story of James Curtis and Sarah Fairchild is a curious one. As legend tells one day James went out to pick corn. When he came back twenty years had passed. In the mean time, Sarah assuming the worst had gotten past her grief and remarried John Colvin. James Curtis wooed Sarah mightily but she was unmoved and spent the remainder of her life as Mrs. John Colvin.</p>

              <p><strong>70.</strong> <strong>Captain Henry Connelly,</strong> born May 02, 1752 in Chester County, Pennsylvania; died May 07, 1840 in Oil Springs, Ky.. He was the son of <strong>140. Thomas Connelly</strong> and <strong>141. Mary Van Harlingen</strong>. He married <strong>71. Ann MacGregor</strong> 1774 in Guilford County, North Carolina.</p>
              <p><strong>71.</strong> <strong>Ann MacGregor,</strong> born February 04, 1756 in North Carolina; died Bef. 1830. She was the daughter of <strong>142. Archibald MacGregor</strong> and <strong>143. Edith MacAlpin</strong>.</p>
              <p>Notes for Captain Henry Connelly:</p>
              <p>Henry Connelly was born and spent his formative years in Chester County, Pa.. His father Thomas was frequently traveling and he was raised by his mother's family, the Van Harlingens. The extent of their influence can be seen when in 1840 Henry applied for his Army pension. During his deposition in Floyd County, Ky. the clerk states that Henry's speech is difficult to follow due to his heavy Dutch accent.</p>
              <p>Henry enlisted in the Colonial Army July 7th, 1777 in Guilford County, North Carolina. He quickly achieved the rank of Captain and to this day is referred to as Captain Henry Connelly. He was stationed in Charlotte, NC. under the command of General Nathanael Greene.</p>
              <p>His first service came as he defended southwestern North Carolina against a Colonel Fannin, a Tory in the Charlotte and Salisbury areas. In November of 1777 Captain Henry joined General Benjamin Lincoln in Savannah, Georgia. In May of 1780 He fought in the Battle of Colson Mill under General Davidson.</p>
              <p>At the Battle of Charlotte, Captain Henry found his troops on the front line of the battle. The first onslaught came from the British Calvary under the command of Lieutenant Banastre Tarleton. Captain Henry held his line but twenty of his troops were lost.</p>
              <p>The most famous battle which Captain Henry participated in was the Battle of Cowpens fought on January 17, 1781. The American forces under the command of General Daniel Morgan. The Americans had been on a retreat from the British forces. At a field outside Spartanburg, South Carolina the Americans made their stand. They fought among the fences and empty cow pens used to herd cattle. The battle lasts a little more than an hour. In the end, over 100 British troops had been killed and were in a disorderly retreat. This was a major victory for the Americans and the beginning of the end for the British rule of America. Henry's troops exhibited great valor in battle and came to be known as " the Dutch Company " in honor of Henry.</p>
              <p>After the war Captain Henry moved his family to Hager Hill, Ky. from Guilford Co., N.C. near Winston-Salem. Here Henry and Ann McGregor lived out the rest of their years. After the death of Ann, Henry remarried Temperance Blair Hitchcock. Many genealogists would question listing Temperance as the sister of George and Noble Blair and I will admit the only proof I have of her lineage is the oral tradition passed down through the Conley generations. I have a great deal of confidence in my family's oral tradition. Temperance was the widow of John Hitchcock Sr.. She was the mother of John Hitchcock Jr. who was the forefather of my grandmother Alma Conley's generation of Hitchcocks.</p>
              <p>Children of Henry Connelly and Ann MacGregor are:</p>
              <p>i. Edmund Connelly, born June 02, 1775 in Guilford County, North Carolina; died 1865 in Magoffin County, Ky; married (1) Lydia Joynes in North Carolina; born Abt. 1780 in Wilkes Co., N.C.; died Bef. 1850 in Johnson Co. Ky.; married (2) Nancy Tackett April 16, 1835 in Floyd Co., Ky.</p>
              <p>Notes for Edmund Connelly:</p>
              <p>Edmund settled at the head of State Fork Road of the Licking River in Magoffin Co., Ky. Many of the Connelly clan in Magoffin Co. are descendants of Edmund. Note that while many Connellys in Magoffin Co. believe to be of a different lineage from the Johnson Co. Conley's, in the vast majority of the cases we are all descendants of Captain Henry Connelly.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>ii. Thomas Connelly, born January 25, 1777 in Guilford County, North Carolina; died 1850 in Hager Hill, Ky; married Susan Joynes; born July 05, 1780 in Wilkes County, North Carolina; died March 25, 1872 in Middle Fork of Jennie's Creek, Johnson Co., Ky.</p>
              <p>Notes for Thomas Connelly:</p>
              <p>When Thomas Connelly first came to Kentucky, he settled on the main fork of Jennie's Creek. He later moved to a farm near the mouth of Miller's Creek on the Big Sandy River. This is what is now known as the Powell Addition of Van Lear. A large oak stands on his grave.</p>
              <p>Notes for Susan Joynes:</p>
              <p>Susan lived to be 92. She wore a silver comb in her hair that was made from a silver bar found in Blockhouse Bottom. The silver bar fed into the legend of the Swift Silver Mines. She was a friend of Jennie Sellards Wiley. It is said that she was living with her son Henry at the time of her death, however in the 1870 census she is living with her daughter Susan and her son in law John Pyrtle Blair.</p>

              <p>Notes for Thomas Connelly:</p>
              <p>The first notable mention of Thomas Connelly came in the service of General Braddock during his ill fated march on Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).</p>
              <p>Thomas Connelly was a traveling man, seeing to holdings as far north as Pennsylvania and as far south as the ancestral family holdings in Charleston, SC.. According to William Elsey Connelly in his history, The Founding of Harman's Station, in 1763, Thomas was in a party which explored the Big Sandy Valley of Eastern Kentucky. Among the party members were, Thomas's brother Harmon Connelly, Daniel Boone, Matthias Harman, James Skaggs, Henry Skaggs and others. They stayed for six weeks near the mouth of Big Paint Creek in cabins long since abandoned by French explorers.</p>
              <p>In 1780 Thomas was in Charleston, South Carolina to consult with his attorney concerning land held by his family in that city. Thomas was caught up in the battle for the city. When the city fell Thomas joined in the army of General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.</p>
              <p>Thomas went on to fight at the battle of King's Mountain on October 7, 1780. During the battle Thomas was shot through by a musket ball. According to family legend Thomas was treated by a Dr. Hicks who was the son-in-law of Thomas's brother Harmon. Dr. Hicks was half Indian and trained in Medicine in France. As treatment for the wound, Dr. Hicks passed a silk handkerchief several times through the wound.</p>
              <p>Thomas died in 1783 as a lingering result of this wound.</p>

              <p>Notes for Archibald MacGregor:</p>
              <p>On April 6th, 1746, the Battle of Culloden was fought between 9,000 British redcoats and 5,000 weak and starving Scottish patriots, among them (Henry) MacAlpin, father of Edith MacAlpin and Archibald MacGregor. This was the last battle of the "Forty-five rebellion". The Scots were led by "Bonnie Prince Charlie", Charles Edward, the English were led by William Augustus, duke of Cumberland. The battle lasted only forty minutes and was a complete rout of the Scots. Only fifty Redcoats were killed as opposed to 1,000 Scotsmen. Among the dead Scots was (Henry) MacAlpin. Archibald Macgregor survived the battle and was not captured. History teaches that in the following five months, a massive manhunt was conducted throughout Scotland for the remaining patriots. It has been speculated that during this time, Archibald and Edith MacGregor escaped Scotland and set sail for America.</p>
