              <p>Here is the chapter with Rosa and Ballard families. David CHAPTER XIII WILLIAM W MAY William W May, a grandson of Caleb May and Margaretta Patrick, and the second son of Blair May (Chapter V) and Sarah Adams, was born May 7, 1834, in Floyd County, Kentucky, he died June 25, 1917, at Leander, in Johnson County, Kentucky. He is buried in the Hargus Conley Cemetery at Riceville, in Johnson County, Kentucky. He married first October 28, 1852, in Floyd County, Kentucky, Catherine Conley, born about 1835, in Floyd County, Kentucky, and died about 1862, in Morgan County, Kentucky. She is very probably buried near Maytown, in Morgan County, Kentucky, although her grave has not been located. She was the daughter of Thomas Conley and Mahala Davis. He married second about 1863, in Letcher County, Kentucky, Mary Conley, born about 1847, and died July 4, 1868, in Floyd County, Kentucky. She is buried in the Conley Cemetery on Conley Fork of Abbott Creek, in Floyd County, Kentucky. She was the daughter of Henry Conley and Rebecca Blair. He married third December 12, 1868, in Magoffin County, Kentucky, Mary Etta Robinson, born July 14, 1853, and died April 11, 1938, at Leander, in Johnson County, Kentucky, she is buried in the Bays Cemetery at Riceville, in Johnson County, Kentucky, the daughter of Samuel Robinson and Martha Spradlin. We have not been able to learn much about this ancestor. Lydia Dora May, the daughter of Sam White May, and a great granddaughter of William's brother Harvey Trimble May, related the story that William May did serve in the Union forces during the Civil War and that he had a dream one night that his wife was sick. He then deserted his unit, returned home to find that his wife, Catherine Conley May, was indeed sick and she is said to have died shortly thereafter. At the Military Records Office of Kentucky in Frankfort, we found a record of a William "J" May who was a member of the 39th Kentucky Volunteer Infantry, Company "C", who joined November 16, 1862, and deserted from Peach Orchard, in Lawrence County, Kentucky, December 10, 1862. We cannot verify that this is in fact our William May, however. Two of his brothers were killed during the war. Henry Harrison May died during the battle of Kennasaw Mountain Georgia, and Stephen May died at Chattanooga, Tennessee. In another letter from a family member, we are told that he spent quite a bit of his time visiting "relation" in a place called Black Water, Virginia (as reported in Volume I). We have since learned that the location of the Black Water he visited was actually in Morgan County, Kentucky, near the little village of Maytown and that the relation he visited were his brothers and sisters who lived in the area. Some members of the family referred to him as "Uncle Billy May". We have still not been able to find proof of the parents of Catherine Conley. As stated in Volume I, we feel strongly that she was the daughter of Thomas Conley and Mahala Davis. As of this writing we have found nothing new information on Catherine.&nbsp; 1A.

They are buried in the May Cemetery on Asa Creek, in Johnson County, Kentucky. Sue was the most gentle person you could ever meet. I do not remember ever hearing her raise her voice in anger to anyone. People always told me that Sue should have been my mother, that I favored her in looks more than I did my Mother and Dad. Sue was saved and Baptisted in December of 1942, when she was 13 years old, and joined the Elouise Church of United Baptist. She showed her belief in Jesus by her daily walks. She remained a faithful member of the church for over 40 years. The following poem is my tribute to my Aunt Sue, whom I loved very much and will miss terribly.&nbsp; ODE TO AUNT MOMMY We had to give her up, you see 'tho she did not want to leave. But Jesus needed another angel, and so he beckoned to her, please. Her husband whom she'd loved so long, was pleading with her too, asking that she join him there, by the river sweet and cool. To say she will be missed, is an understated fact. But knowing that she is adorned with golden gown and crown will help us all to make it through, when courage we do lack. Her only earthly treasures were in the children that she bore, and now she watches cautiously from that golden shinning shore. Altho' not a child of hers, was told I should have been, as many people often spoke when the two of us they'd seen. Aunt Mommy, as I often called, for she was close and dear, and in my heart she'll always be, so I can hold her near. As you watch us from your new home on high, just know that you are loved and we who miss you o' so much. will always feel you neigh.

MY DAD Altho' you're gone and missed by all that knew and love you so, It seems that you are very near to us, as on with life we go. You were to very young to go, so much still here to do, but He had a very special job that only you could do. Perhaps your job is now to build the mansion promised, sure, to those of us who love and trust, in Him who holds our treasure. You loved and trusted Him, while here with us you lived, and now you sing his praise with those you longed so much to see. Your Mom, and Dad, your brothers, sisters, too, I know they all were standing by to warmly welcome you. And now at last your pain is gone, and you sing "Amazing Grace", which was your very favorite song while you traversed in this place. My dearest Dad, with not a care or worry, please keep an eye on those of us who in this life still tarry.

You're now with Dad, with Grandma and Grandpa, too, I know they happily spread their arms to warmly welcome you. You were so dear to those who must remain, and we will hold your memory near 'til we see you once again. As you watch from your new home, and all the world can see, we worry not about your plight and know you are pain free. Just keep an eye on all of us, and help us when you can to make it through the strife of life befalling every man. To say "You're missed" does fall so short of the feelings our heart, but knowing your joy and happiness did help to ease in part. Forever in our heart and minds your face and name will stay. And we shall meet with you again some happy glorious day. 137 Ruby Janet May, born November 7, 1927, on the Frozen Branch of Asa Creek in John- son County, Kentucky.

Ed and Ruby in live in Indianapolis, Indiana. Ruby wrote about their life: "Since publication of OUR FAMILY HERITAGE in 1985, Art Craft has been sold and is now Jackson Press in Indianapolis. Ed is semi-retired, but still keeps busy doing desk-top publishing for the company. Yet we find the time to travel a lot, especially to golf tournaments. As well as time to enjoy our grandchildren." Ed's vocation was the printing business. Ruby has spent many years searching for the "Family Roots" and has been a very great help to the author on this volume. In 1992, she reprinted the Volume I of OUR FAMILY HERITAGE, so that other family members could take advantage of the historic family information included in it. Ruby has been so very helpful in getting this volume published, also. She has always encouraged me when the going got tough, and with all the information I had to deal with, they got tough very often. She has also purchased copies of other family histories that might have a connection to our family. Although she is my Aunt, she has felt more like a sister. She was only 14 years of age when I was born. For their children see numbers 355 through 359. 24.

When Earl returned September of 52, we moved to California. Mom and Dad came to California in the following year and we both bought homes Azusa, California. Our other children were born about Covina, California. Earl and I moved to Kennewick Washington 1968 and to Yakima, Washington 1971 and on to Liberty Lake (a suburb of Spokane) Washington 1973." "At long last I have a little time to think about family history. Really am sorry to have been so long getting back to you. This has been rather an awesome year for us. Since last September my husband has been and out of in the hospital three times with prostate and breathing problems. Many days are a struggle for him. He finally went on oxygen full time and that does help. Each day is different, so we take one day at a time. Then July our oldest daughter, Lynn, gave birth - three months prematurely - to a baby girl. In The baby weighed one pound and 15, ounces and we had no idea that she would live as she was so undeveloped. But she did and came home last week at six pounds 10, ounces. A shunt was implanted a few weeks ago to remove fluid from her brain and eye surgery was performed three weeks ago. Such a little mite to have so much done to her. We won't know for a few months how much sight she has. She is a beautiful baby and otherwise seems to be developing well. Praise In The Lord! You can gather that I've had my hands pretty full for a while."

A son of this couple was with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division that went into the Island of Grenada. Dorothy has supplied a newspaper story and a letter from President Ronald Reagan, which she would like included in the book. I know that all of us are patriotic and love our country, but I feel it is very nice to know that we have relatives that are still serving our country in the manner that some of our fore-fathers did. All of us have roots back to the American Revolution, and can be very proud of the debt our family has paid to preserve the freedom we enjoy. "Sunday Citizen Patriot, Jackson, Michigan, November 6, 1983, 147th year, No. 60. FAMILY PROUD OF SON IN COMBAT by James Weiker Citizen Patriot Staff Writer. The first news Laurence E and Dorothy S. Wheeler, 9231 Snow Road, Horton, received after the U.S. troops landed in Grenada was a telephone call from a friend of their son, Sgt. Timothy E. Wheeler, 21. The friend read a note to the Wheeler Family from Tim that said only, "I love you and don't worry". Small assurance for the Wheeler's.&nbsp; For a week waited anxiously and watched Television reports from Grenada for a glimpse of Tim, but with no luck. From Television they got a telephone number to call, bur the only thing they could learn was that Tim was alive.&nbsp; They called Fort Bragg, even speaking to Tim's commander, but could learn nothing more. Then Thursday, more than a week after the 82nd Airborne landed, they received a letter from Grenada. Tim had parachuted onto the island with the first group of the 82nd Airborne, and was not part of the force policing the island. Tim told them about parachuting onto the island from only 500 above land - and of being shot at while searching for hidden arms. He joked in the letter about the snipers being bad shots, which reassured his parents that he was in good spirits. Again in the letter he told his parents not to worry - a useless request. Tim and his comrades found those arms - five warehouses full of crates of Soviet weapons "piled to the ceiling". Reports like this, and seeing the students arriving back in the United States praising the military, have convinced Laurence Wheeler that President Ronald Reagan was right in sending troops to Grenada. "As much as I'm scared to death for Tim, I believe President Reagan did the right thing," says Wheeler. Even the long, uncertain wait seems justified because of the need for secrecy. This was the only way the operation could have been done, he believes, and "It was just great the way we did it." "I've always been somewhat of a hawk, and I think it's about time we did something," says Wheeler. "We ought to take a stand somewhere, we can't just sit back."" In reply to a letter they wrote to President Reagan giving their support to the invasion of Grenada, they received the following reply. "The White House, Washington, DC January 16, 1984 Dear Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler: Your recent message touched me deeply. All America is great full for the achievements of your son and his fellow service men. I pay homage along with all my countrymen to the heros of Grenada. Every American can be proud of the gallant and professional job performed by our Armed Forces personnel. We grieve with the families of those brave, proud young Americans who have sacrificed their lives for our country and for the preservation of peace. The families and friends of these patriotic young service men are cut from the same cloth as those whose unity in the defense of freedom gave special meaning to the first emblem of our great United States. With such Americans as you, service to our nation will continue to be a proud tradition. You can be sure that our service men and women will always be uppermost in my heart and mind. Thank you and God bless you. Sincerely, Ronald Reagan" There may be some who feel this should have not been included in a family history book, but in just a few short years, there will be people who will want to read about what Tim and the others did in Grenada, as we, the authors, would have loved to have had on each person in this book. We are proud of our country and of each person in our "family" mentioned in this book. We could only include what we were supplied.

TO THE MEMORY OF PAPAW As with all things, the end must come. The closing of a day, A life passing away. Remembering, and reflecting on both with the fondest of memories. Replaced, we know they'll never be. The time of mourning is somehow lessened by a new morning. Reminding us our sunset is still a day away. PRINCESS OF THE SOUTH The words to describe her fail me. How can one put words on a soul so free? What comes to mind is a place of a different time, Where opened air plantations would be her domain, A rocking chair her throne on which she would reign. The Princess of the South, she would be known, with no predecessors to her throne. This is how I picture her to be, still with a soul so free,&nbsp; But words to describe her, still fail me.
