              <p>Notes for DANIEL WOOSTER JOHNS, SR.: &nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Big Sandy Valley by William Ely Page 394 An incident well illustrating Mr. Turman's social nature, but more especially his love of gain, happen in the Summer of 1860, which is historic enough to be recorded in this sketch. The county of Boyd had been formed during the decision of the Legislature of the 1859 and 1860. The new county with Lawrence was made a legislative district. The Whig- American combination in politics appointed a day to hold their convention, to bring out a candidate to represent the district in the lower branch of the Legislature. Turman's Ferry. Being centrally located it was selected as the place where the first convention of the people of the two counties should assemble to make a nomination. The day on which the meeting of the clans occurred was lovely in the extreme. The Big Sandy had, from recent rains swelled sufficiently to enable a Sandy steamer to take the delegation from Catlettsburg to the meeting place. The people of Gate City (Catlettsburg, Ky.), as the county seat had been fixed at the their place, were in a mood to love everybody. They and felt that it would be courteous to go en masse to the gathering of the people from Lawrence and their proud little county, and thus show by their presence that they wished to bind in the bonds of indissoluble friendship the people of the two counties. When the boat left Catlettsburg. Many of the people had baskets well filled with viands, of which to make their dinner. A few however, had not taken their lunch along with them; but they cared nothing for that, as Mr. Turman was prepared to feed all who might apply in sharing it with those who were not so fortunate. Vast crowds came down from Louisa and vicinity and most of them came on horse back, it was inconvenient to cumber themselves with a lunch basket, especially when they knew that they could be supplied at the Turman Hotel.</p>
              <p>The great meeting was held in Mr. Turman's new barn, just erected, as if for the occasion, Captain William Vinson, Daniel Johns, Laban T. Moore, together with many other noted citizens of Lawrence County, were present. Daniel Johns was nominated, and at the ensuing election, elected to the Legislature, being the first to fill that honorable position in the new district. Mr. Johns served faithfully and received the plaudits of his constituency. But soon after his term expired he removed to Minnesota, where he has ever since resided. The removal of Mr. Johns created a vacuum in the affairs of Lawrence County. He was a very kind, genial man, and sensible as well.</p>
              <p>Back to the incident. After the nomination was made, many of those who had brought no lunch rushed to the hotel, where Mr. And Mrs. Turman had made ample preparation to feed all who might call for dinner. The tables were filled with rich viands that were devoured with a keen relish by the hungry crowd who filled up the tables, in the best of spirits, praising the dinner and the both hosts. Mr. Turman business tact never forsook him _ No, not under the most trying circumstances. He must have been led to believe that the feasters thought it was free to all meal. As dignified as he could be passed up and down the hall, talking pleasantly to all, he remarked that he had plenty to eat, and it was free to all: "But" said he. "If you see proper to give a quarter a piece, old Jim (as he called himself) will not be offended. If any one previously supposed that this was a free meal, he was now undeceived, and all planked down a quarter. It was not meanness in him; it was a very soft way to manage business with a promiscuous crowd. &nbsp;</p>

              <p>Notes for WILSON M. CLARK: [johns.FTW]</p>
              <p>Because Wilson was a Freemason, a member of Zebulon Lodge #273 F.&amp;A.M. Prestonsburg KY, five of his orphaned children were placed in the Masonic Widows and Orphans home at Louisville, Ky on Feb. 5, 1889 at the request of Zebulon Lodge.&nbsp; No record ever exists that John Graham Clark ever resided in the Masonic Home, however, the other five children resided there.&nbsp; Mary Ann left the home on July 15, 1897 at her own request to live with her Uncle, James Clark at Dwale, KY.&nbsp; Minta Alice left the home at her own request on June 7, 1897 to live with a Dr. Moore at Clay, Webster Co., KY.&nbsp; No record existed as to when James Harry left but is was probably in 1898.&nbsp; Elizabeth and Rebecca left the home on July 5, 1900 at the request of the Zebulon Lodge.</p>

              <p>Notes for MILTON BURNS JOHNS: Milton Burns Johns mother died when he was five years old. As a young man he was 5' 8'' tall and around 135 pounds. He had blue eyes and brown hair. I believe that his weight was never over 160 lbs. He worked in the coal mines in Eastern KY as a young man. He was an Electrician Helper (above ground). He loved to hunt and fish and he made it very clear that if you shoot something it was to put food on the table for your family or friend.</p>
              <p>He was a very good marksman and won several shooting contests, as was his brother, Johnny B. Johns, in fact most of the Johns I have come in contact with could handle a rifle better than most. He went to work for ARMCO Steel company in 1920 and retired there at the age of 65 from the Steam and Power Dept. He loved the people he worked with and the company he worked for.</p>
              <p>But the thing that he loved most was his grandchildren and being with them. When he would come to visit, the children in the neighborhood would bring their toys to fix or want him to come out to play with them. He loved it and he would say "Just look at them, I wish that they could be this happy forever". He was over 65 and still enjoyed the sounds that only children can make. (I loved him very much, his son, George M. Johns)</p>
