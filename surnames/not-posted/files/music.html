EARLY MUSIC FAMILY HISTORY By Dr. Roy A Chessmore Much of the history of the Music family was provided by Charles
Spradlin, Alice Cox, Nancy Music, May Spradlin, and from tape recordings by Susie Wilmeth, Ruth Spradin, and Josephine
Lowrance. A. Charles believes that GEORGE MUSICK, SR. was the son of the first Music's that came to America from England
and Wales (probably about 1700). The will of George Musick, Sr. was probated March 5, 1754, in Spotsylvania County, near
the east coast of Virginia. His wife was Ann Allen. Their children were: (not in order of their birth and all born in
Spotsyvania, Virginia); Elexious, born 1718 and died 1798 in Russel County, Virginia; Ambrose, born 1720 and died 1806
in Albemarle County, Virginia; Elphraim, Sr. born in 1724 and died 1806 in Albemarle County. Ephraim married Isabella
Roy on March 16, 1741. Her father and mother were James and Elizabeth Roy; George Musick, Jr. was born in 1726 and died
in 1809 in Rutherford, N. C. He married Mary Ann Hayes; Abraham, born in 1727 and died in 1832 at St. Louis, Mo. He
first married Sarah Lewis and then Elizabeth Conley; Elizabeth "Trusty"; Agnes Lynn; Kenzia: and Daniel, who first
married Elizabeth and then Jean. George Musick, Sr. was granted 300 acres of land in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, on
September 8, 1728 (probably from the King of England). George Musick, Jr. is listed on a deed dated February 13, 1775,
in Albemarle County, Virginia. B. EPHRAIM MUSICK, SR., the son of George Musick, Sr. was born in 1724. He died in 1806
and was buried on his farm located 12 miles west of Charlotteville, Virginia, in Albemarle County. Ephraim married
Isabella Roy and their children were: Helen, who married Edward Jenkins; Abraham, who married Therrell Musick; Thomas
Roy, who married Marry Neville; John who married Mary Berry; Elphraim, Jr. who married Winnie Gillespie in Madison
County, Kentucky, on October 3, 1787. Winnie was born in 1767 in Albemarle County, Virginia. Her father and mother were
David and Betsy Gillespie. C. The children of EPHRAIM MUSICK, JR. and Winnie were: Nancy, who married Parness Wood, Oct.
3, 1786; Mary, who married Cornelius McFall; Winnie, who married Joshua Gentry and John Wesley Musick. D. JOHN WESLEY
"WES" MUSICK, the fourth son of Ephraim Sr., and Winnie Musick, was born in 1785 in Madison County, Virginia. He died at
Little Creek, north of Prestonsburg, Kentucky, and near East Point. (Note: "Wes" is considered the "Grandaddy" of the
modern Music clan because both parents of Nancy Margaret Music, as well as those of "Tobe", Jim, and "Bill" Music of Elk
City, trace back to him.) John Wesley married Isabella Harris on May 10, 1805. Their children, all born in Washington
County, Virginia, were: Rhoda, who married James Shell (Schell) on May 23, 1822; Tracey, who married William Stone, May
23, 1822; James C. Music, born in 1806, who married Mariah Shell, the daughter of Andrew Shell; George Washington Music,
who married Catherine Hawk; Abraham (a twin), who married Nancy Jones; Isaac (a twin); Andrew Jackson Music, who married
Mary Therza Hawk, daughter of Andrew Hawk; Mary Pauling "Polly", the mother of James K. Polk Musick; Michael, who
married Mary Crabtree on March 28, 1860; and Thomas McCullough, who married (1) Mary Fulton and (2) Mi1lisa Jane Wilson.
D-1 JAMES C. MUSIC (a blacksmith) was born in 1806 in Surrey County in northwest North Carolina. He died in Floyd
County, Kentucky. James married Mariah Shell, who was born in 1809 in Sullivan County, Tennessee. Her parents were
Andrew and Mariah Shell. The children of James and Mariah were: Mary A.; John: Andrew; Abraham; Phoebe; Archibald Gobel,
who married Sarah Katherine Music (a cousin); Lovisa; Wenton; Newton; and Milton. D-2 GEORGE WASHINGTON MUSIC, the son
of John Wesley Musick, was born in 1810 in Washington County, Virginia, but grew up around East Point, Kentucky. He
first married Catherine Hawk, who was born in 1814. Her father was Andrew Hawk. (He was probably a Cherokee Indian). The
children of George and Catherine were: Andrew; Mary Jane; Isabella; John Wesley, who married Clarenda Baldridge; Rachel,
who married George Leaks; Sarah Catherine, born December 22, 1843, who married her first cousin, Archibald Gobel Music.
George Washington Music then married Rachel K. Minix and their children were: Lennie Susan, who married James Conley;
Michael, who married Mary Crabtree; Delila, who married Littonton Hopson; Thomas Jefferson, who married Mary Louise
Green; Martha who married Calvin Burke; James, who married Ellen Baldridge; Henery, who married Frances Isabella Greer;
Claremda (a twin with Henry J.), who married Commodore Gobel (Could this be where Arch Gobel Spradlin's name came
from?); George McClelland, who married Sarah Vaughan (or Sarah Conley) (Note: George McClelland was the father of Jim
Music who married Mariah Spradlin, the daughter of Samuel and Nancy Spradlin. He was also the father of William "Bill"
Music who married Sally Music, the daughter of James K. Polk Music. George McClelland moved to Ohio, and Alice Cox went
to see him there.); Harriet, who married John Hopson, Ben Spencer, and Ben Yates; and Lincoln, who married Mahalla Webb.
George Washington Music fathered 17 children, many of whom were relatives of the present-day Musics. E. ARCHIBALD GOBEL
MUSIC, the son of James C. Music, was born in 1841 in Washington County, Virginia. He died at Canute, Oklahoma. He
married his first cousin, Sarah Catherine Music, on January 20, 1864. Sarah was born December 22, 1843, in Washington
County, Virginia. She died at Canute, Oklahoma, in 1936. Her parents were George Washington and Catherine Hawk Music.
Archibald and Sarah Catherine were married in Kentucky and had eight children, including Grandma Nancy Margaret. They
lived on a large farm near Prestonsburg, Kentucky. In addition to farming, they had a coal mine, excellent hardwood
timber, sugar maples for making sugar, and a sorghum mill. They were considered wealthy for that time; however, they
didn't want their children to work in the dangerous coal mines, so they decided to move to Beckham County, Oklahoma,
where their son, "Trigg" and other Music families lived. Arch Spradlin, my wife's father, came with them in 1906 and
worked with them and "Trigg" and (probably) for the James K. Polk Music family that had moved there in 1901. (See the
pioneer family stories written in 1973 by Nancy "Nannie" and May Music.) Archibald and Sarah lived west of old Highway
41 settlement on Elk Creek just inside the Washita County line and southwest of where " Tobe" and Sarah lived. After
Archibald died in 1919, Sarah Catherine lived with Grandpa and Grandma Samuel Spradlin until she died in 1936. We have a
picture of the entire Grandpa Spradlin family, including the in-laws and grandchildren. If any of you know all, or most
of these, in the picture, please let me know. The children of Archibald and Sarah Catherine Music were: (1) James B. and
(2) Abraham, who married Margaret Badge. Their children were Johnie, who married Guy Morgan; May; Walter, who married
Nannie Freels; Abraham, "Abby"; Susan; and Elinor. (Abraham, Susan, and Elinor all stayed in Kentucky. (3) Nancy
Margaret, who was born April 12, 1869, in Kentucky and died August 2, 1946, at Canute, Oklahoma. She married Rev. Samuel
Spradlin on March 19, 1886. His parents were Johnathan and Sarah Ellen Vaughan Spradlin. (Note: The history and
genealogy of the Samuel and Nancy Margaret Spradlin family will be covered later.) (4.) George W. Music, who married
Florence Pruitt on December 8, 1887. Their children were: (1) William Trigg "Bill" Music, who was born July 20, 1884, in
Floyd County, Kentucky. "Bill" died September 11, 1991, at Elk City at 97 years of age. Children from his first marriage
were: Frankie, Benita and their two brothers. He married Carolyn Snoddy on November 20, 1977, at Elk City. (She was the
one who sent me the information on Bill.) Bill had a very interesting family history. He came to Oklahoma with his
parents, George W. and Florence Pruitt Music, in 1903. He attended East Texas Normal College at Commerce, Texas, and
Oklahoma A. & M. at Stillwater, Oklahoma, majoring in Dairy Management. He spent three years in the National Guard and
in the U. S. Army during World War I, was wounded, and received several medals for bravery. After the war, he taught
school at the Chilocco Indian School, managed the dairy program at the famous 101 Ranch near Ponca City, and then spent
20 years in the furniture, real estate, and ranching business around Elk City until his retirement in 1972. He was
inducted into the Western Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1989. His wife, Carolyn, said, "Bill was still raising a garden and
doing his yard work at 95. He was also carrying "Meals on Wheels" to the "old folks" around town. He died at age 97
without ever becoming cranky or senile." (What a man! I wish I had known him.) (Continuing the children of George W.
Music and Florence Pruitt) (2) John R. Music, who was born July 26, 1909; (3) Josey (Elizabeth ?), who married Sledge;
(4) Margaret; and (5) Tom Dolan. The fifth child of Archibald and Sarah Catherine Music was Zechariah "Zach" Music, born
in 1875, who married Lucy Stevens. Their children were: Faris, born in 1898; Sally, born in 1900 and who married Orie
Martin; and Eva, born November 23, 1902. She married Neg Keas. The sixth was Wesley "Wes" Musick, born in 1878 in
Johnson County, Kentucky. He married Lou at East Point, Kentucky. Their children, both born at Keas, Oklahoma, were:
Floyd; and Pearl, who married Haggard. (7) Thomas "Tom" Music, born in 1883, who married Thursa Osborne. Their children
were: Thomas Henry, who married Mary Baldridge; and Eunice, who married Willie Spradlin. (8) William W. "Trigg" Music,
(the brother of Nancy Margaret) was born July 8, 1885, at East Point in Johnson County, Kentucky. He died June 29, 1972,
and is buried in the Ural Cemetery. "Trigg" married Mallie M. Adams, who was born August 16, 1884, and died June 14,
1965. Her father was Carl Adams. The children of "Trigg" and Mallie, all born at Elk City, were; Ralph, born April 30,
1906, and died April 26, 1965; Gobel, (a Church of Christ preacher), who married May Davis; Nettie, who married
Cantrell; Pauline, who married T. C. "Check" Davis; Alice Marie, who married L. J. Jones; Beatrice, who married Pete
Tate; WiIliam Trigg, Jr.; and Jody "Jo". JAMES K. POLK MUSIC was born in 1845. (Note: See the story of a pioneer family
written by Nancy "Nannie" Music, the sister of "Tobe" and Theo Music.) James K. Polk's mother was Mary Pauline "folly"
Musick, born in 1825. She was the daughter of John Wesley and Isabella Harris Musick and the sister of James C., George
Washington, and Thomas McCullough Music. James K. Polk Music married Sarah (or Susan) Katherine Powers in Kentucky. They
came to Beckham County, Oklahoma, in a covered wagon in 1901. The trip took 61 days. The children of James K. Polk and
Sarah Catherine Music were: (1) William Theodore "Theo", who was born at East Point, Kentucky. He died November 14,
1951, and is buried in the Ural Cemetery. He married Alice Adelaide Tackett whose parents were Robert and Priscilla
George Tackett. The children of Theo and Alice were: May Lee, who married Sam Spradlin; Susan Priscilla, who married G.
E. "Nig" Mabe; James Henry, who married Ruth Cartwright; Samuel Robert "Sam Bob", who married Velma Windell (Sam Bob
lived with May and Sam until he married); Adelaide and Alice, twins, born August 13, 1913. They died at 3 and 6 months
of age. Their mother, Alice, died at childbirth, and Theo moved to Washington state. (2) Everett Benjamin "Tobe" Music,
who married Sarah Ellen Spradlin. Their children were Sylvia; Fannie Lou; and Everett Benjamin, Jr. (3) Mary, who
married Eugene Melvin of the Hefner community near Canute and later moved to Florida; (4) John, who married Cora Bonny.
Their children were: Idell, who married Parks and now lives at Canute; Verna, who married Stover of Canute; and Jackie,
who married Neighbors and lives in Oklahoma City; (5) Sarah Virginia, who married William "Bill" Music (the son of
George McClelland Music and the brother of Jim Music who married Mariah Spradlin). Sarah and Bill have one son, Glen,
who lives in Canute. (6) Nancy Jane, "Nannie", who married Henry Millerton and C. E. Langford. (She is the one who wrote
the story of her pioneer family.) (7) Dora; (8) Letita "Letta"; (9-10) Twins, Tommy and Emily, who died in infancy; and
(11.) Dove, who died at 21-22 years of age in Kentucky. I would like to include the story written by Nannie and the one
written by May, Theo's daughter, also written in 1973. I think you will enjoy them as much as I did. (These stories were
given to me by Gwendolyn Spradlin of Weatherford.) Nancy "Nannie" Music's story of her pioneer family: "The Music family
originally settled around east central Virginia. Our father and mother, James K. Polk and Sarah Music, lived at East
Point, Kentucky, about 10 miles north of Prestonsburg. We were a family of 11 children, two of which, Tommy and Emily,
died in infancy. "Tobe", our second oldest brother, came to Oklahoma in 1900 with our neighbors, the Crit Hagers. The
Hager family settled on land in the Pleasant Valley community east of Busch (now Elk City). Tobe filed on land southeast
of town in the rough canyon area. "There were no fences and the ranchers' cattle ran free. Tobe worked at helping clear
land for farming and for a time worked on the Orient Railroad which was near where Sentinel is now located. "In early
April of 1901, our family (Dad, Mother, Mary (20), John (18), Sally (10), Nancy (Nannie) (7), Dora (5), and Letitia
"Letta" (3) along with Theo's family (his wife Alice, and their two little girls, May (2) and Priscilla (1) left East
Point, Kentucky in two covered wagons headed for the prairie country of Oklahoma. "We traveled through Kentucky,
crossing the Ohio River at Louisville and on through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, entering Oklahoma just
north of Ponca City. I can't remember our particular route through these states; nor do I remember crossing the
Mississippi River; but I do remember distinctly many little incidents along the way. The weather was good most of the
time, and it wasn't necessary to set up a tent very often. We usually camped near a river or lake, and we always set up
camp on Saturday so that we could go to church and Sunday School on Sunday. We would then break camp and travel again on
Monday morning. The Music family members were good singers and sometimes Mary and John would be asked to sing a special
number. One instance that I remember was that a little church along the way did not have their usual Sunday night
service, but instead, dismissed and joined the Music family around the campfire for singing. "We arrived in Oklahoma in
late June as healthy as when we left East Point. We stopped first at the Hagers. Then we set up our camp and tents on
Tobe's homestead where we lived for about a year while the men built a large rock house and barn which the two families
shared for nearly three years. "Another amusing incident was that Dad had told us we were moving to the prairie and that
we would see no more rocks and canyons when we got to Oklahoma; so I gathered a tobacco sack of pebbles and tied them
under the wagon as a memento from Kentucky. I believe that we homesteaded on the rockiest spot in Oklahoma! "Dad and
Theo bought a relinquished claim of 160 acres adjoining Tobe's land in the rocky canyons southeast of town. The men cut
timber along Elk Creek and helped clear farm land and did any other work they could find for a living. They planted a
fruit orchard and garden on Tobe's place. Theo and Alice had two more children, Johnny and Robert, before moving to the
house they had built on their own land. "We shared "Tobe's" house until he was married to Sarah Spradlin about 1908.
Mary had filed on 40 acres when she reached 21 but relinquished it to John when he reached 21. She married Eugene Melvin
in 1902 and lived on his homestead in the Hefner community. (Probably the place west of Grandpa Spradlin's home place.)
John married Cora Bonney in 1903 and moved into the home he had built on his homestead. "After Dad and Mother and we
four younger girls moved to our own homes, Dad only lived a couple of years, and then Theo's wife, Alice, died after
giving birth to twin baby girls, Alice and Adelaide, who only lived a few months. Later, Sallie and Dora married, and
Letta and I moved to Mangum to work. We were both married after a year or so, and the family was finally scattered from
Florida to Washington. All are deceased except myself (Nannie) of Dad's family. Three of Theo's family are still in
Oklahoma--May Spradin, Canute; Johnny Music, Cordell; and Priscilla Mabe, Elk City. Three of John's children still live
in the area--Idell Parks and Verna Stover, both of Canute; and Jackie Neighbors of Oklahoma City. Also, one of Sallie's
children, Glen, lives in Canute. Only May, Priscilla, and myself were members of the covered-wagon group. "Another
incident not so amusing was when Mother and Alice washed up all our clothes and bedding and hung them to dry on a fence
around a spring where the range cattle came to water. Much of the clothing and bedding was torn from the fence and
trampled by the cattle which left us with a very meager supply. "There were two of these years after Dad died that the
rest of the family, stayed together and farmed. Theo had gone to Washington state and his two children stayed with
different members of the family. (May stayed with Grandpa and Grandma Spradlin and "Jim Bob" stayed with Sam and May
Spradlin until he was married.) Mother sold our place and moved onto rented land down near the Hefner Methodist Church
(where Grandpa sometimes preached) which is near the Church of the Nazarene (where Sam and May were members). Not long
after this, Mary's family moved to Florida. "Shopping was always done in Elk City and banking at Pete Thurmond's bank.
Herring and Young's General Store was the main source of supplies. "Grandchildren, great grandchildren, and great, great
grandchildren still live around Elk City and Canute and are scattered around the state." (Isn't that a wonderful story!)
The following memories of the pioneer's life in Oklahoma was written in 1973 by May Music Spradlin, the daughter of Theo
and Alice Music and the wife of Sam Spradlin. "We came out of Kentucky in a covered wagon on ferries down the Big Sandy
River. We also crossed the Mississippi River on a ferry. We never drove on Sunday; that was the day that we rested our
horses. It took us 61 days to make the trip From Kentucky to Oklahoma. "When we got to the plains states, I remember the
first windmill I had ever seen. My daddy pointed it out to me. When we first got to Oklahoma, we lived in a tent on
Daddy's farm until Daddy built a half-dugout. It was made with logs, just enough above the ground to put in small
windows. It had a dirt floor, and I remember that we would go out and gather broomweed, and take an old broom handle and
tie the weeds together around it, to sweep the dirt floor. The dugout was made of logs, brush, and big grass sods. "I
think we lived in the dugout until after I was in school. They didn't start me to school until my sister was old enough
to go with me. We had to walk through two or three canyons, and there were plenty of coyotes and wolves around. We lived
three miles from school. We would go by Grandma's house, and then all go together to school."
