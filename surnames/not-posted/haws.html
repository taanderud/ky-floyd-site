        <p>&nbsp;<strong>Haws/ Hawes</strong></p>
        <p>Our Hawes/Haws line has taken a real beating as it has been transcribed as Howes on so many records. Samuel Hawes/Haws Sr. and wife Elizabeth moved to KY from Tazewell County, VA before Floyd County was formed. They settled on the Southern most branch of the Licking River near the Mann family. This areas was first Floyd then Lawrence County. With Samuel came his adult sons Samuel Jr. and Robert. Sons Sampson, Azriel and John came of age in 1809 when they married in Floyd County. When Samuel Sr. died in 1813/14 there were still two minor children Benjamin and Elizabeth at home. These two went to older brother John until they came of age in 1817. Robert was the first coroner in Floyd County and John one of the first clerks. In fact these brothers held every position you can think of in Floyd County during the first twenty years after the county was formed. I have photo copies of most of the original records. In fact, John Haws married the grand daughter of Moses Preston in 1809 and he met at Moses home when the Methodist Church was formed. The Howes family again was given credit for this......untrue! In fact John named his three sons after founders of that faith: Asbury, James Wesley and Allen Paul. The oldest Howes in Floyd County during this period was but 19 years of age and came from Maryland. My family has not taken its rightful place in Floyd County history as one of Floyds founding pioneer families. Best Regards, <a href="mailto:jimhawes@ix.netcom.com">Jim Hawes</a></p>
