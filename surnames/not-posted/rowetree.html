              <p>Notes for JAMES ROWE SR.:</p>
              <p>James Rowe, Sr. left North Carolina in 1781 and appears in Botetourt</p>
              <p>County, Virginia on the 1790 census along with Benjamin and George Rowe.</p>
              <p>These men were probably brothers. Benjamin and George disappear from the</p>
              <p>county after 1796. They could have moved to another state. James Sr.</p>
              <p>remained in Botetourt until 1806 when he moved to Spruce Run, a branch of</p>
              <p>New River in Giles County, Virginia. Stephen later lived on this land.</p>
              <p>James Rowe, Sr. and all his sons except Stephen moved to Floyd County (now</p>
              <p>Pike County) Kentucky, in 1817, and are on the 1820 and the 1830 census for</p>
              <p>Floyd and Pike Counties, Kentucky.</p>
              <p>He fought for the British in the Revolutionary War. He was wounded at the</p>
              <p>Battle of the Hawk while fighting against the army of General "Lighthorse"</p>
              <p>Lee, the father of Robert E. Lee. James was wounded by a sabre in the leg</p>
              <p>and carried the wound the rest of his life.</p>

              <p><strong>3.</strong> STEPHEN3 ROWE <i>(JAMES ROWE</i>2 <i>SR., ROWE</i>1<i>)</i> was born 1780 in Virginia, and died 1843 in Giles Co., Virginia. He married BARBARA HUFFMAN April 04, 1801 in Giles Co., Virginia. She was born 1781 in Virginia.</p>
              <p>Notes for STEPHEN ROWE:</p>
              <p>Stephen lived in the vicinity of his father's home place all his life, as</p>
              <p>evidenced by his purchase of land granted by his father in 1808 on Spruce</p>
              <p>Run, a branch of New River. Stephen and Barbary lived in a log house, with</p>
              <p>probably one room which most house's had at that time, they had a fireplace</p>
              <p>in one end of the room, table, chairs and benches, the loom, as they had to</p>
              <p>weave material for their clothing. They also had a spinning wheel in a</p>
              <p>place of convenience as it was used constantly. The parents usually slept</p>
              <p>in the main room and the children slept in a loft. Cooking was done over</p>
              <p>the fireplace, which was also the heat source for the cabin.</p>
              <p>Stephen bought and sold land several times between 1810 and 1837. I have</p>
              <p>been unable to find the grave site for Stephen but I am sure he was buried</p>
              <p>in Giles County, Virginia. Barbara, or Barbary which seemed to be her</p>
              <p>nickname apparently moved to Pike County, Kentucky with her children as she</p>
              <p>is listed on some of the documents in that county.</p>
              <p>In the will of John Huffman, the father of Barbara Huffman Rowe, dated the</p>
              <p>6th day of March, 1824 and recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit</p>
              <p>Court of Giles County at Giles August Court, 1834, contained the following</p>
              <p>provision; "Negroes to be sold by my executors immediately after by decease</p>
              <p>and the money arising from such sale to be equally divided among my</p>
              <p>daughters Catherine Damewood, Sophia Roe, Barbara Roe, Faney Hevery and</p>
              <p>Mary Bostevs except ten dollars to be give over and above to my daughter</p>
              <p>Mary Boster, to be freely enjoyed by then forever."</p>
              <p>Stephen may have married a second time in that Rebecca Rowe is listed as</p>
              <p>the mother of Reuben</p>

              <p><strong>4.</strong> HUFFMAN4 ROWE <i>(STEPHEN</i>3<i>, JAMES ROWE</i>2 <i>SR., ROWE</i>1<i>)</i> was born 1829 in Giles Co., Virginia, and died November 09, 1863 in Richmond, Virginia. He married LOUISA STEELE January 21, 1850 in Pike Co. Ky..</p>
              <p>Notes for HUFFMAN ROWE:</p>
              <p>Huffman Rowe fought in the Civil War and mustered in at Peach Orchard,</p>
              <p>Kentucky. He was a Private in the 39th Regiment, Kentucky, Infantry,</p>
              <p>Company D on the Union side. While on scout duty in the head of Marrowbone</p>
              <p>Creek in Pike County on August 24, 1863 he was captured by confederate</p>
              <p>soldiers and taken to a rebel prison in Richmond, Virginia where he died on</p>
              <p>November 9, 1863 of the typhoid fever at Hospital #21. Other Rowe men were</p>
              <p>also members of the Regiment: Loyd Rowe, Ruebin H. Rowe, Sr., Ruebin H.</p>
              <p>Rowe, Jr., Solomon Rowe, Jacob Rowe and William H. Rowe (son of Jonathan</p>
              <p>Rowe).</p>
              <p>Huffman first appears by name in Pike County, Kentucky in the 1850 census</p>
              <p>as being married to Louisa and living next door to his mother Barbary. His</p>
              <p>first name was taken from his mother's maiden name.</p>
              <p>On November 24, 1852, from a Pike county land Grant of 1000 unimproved</p>
              <p>acres to George N. Brown, Huffman bought 50 acres located on the first</p>
              <p>right hand hollow of Marrowbone Creek. Later the land was a subject of a</p>
              <p>Circuit Court action when Huffman's children turned 18 years old (1870's).</p>
              <p>In a Pike county Court Order of 1852 he was appointed as surveyor of a</p>
              <p>road: "Ordered that Huffman Rowe be appointed surveyor of the ----- road on</p>
              <p>Russell Fork commencing at the Mouth of Marrowbone down the ----- to Guy</p>
              <p>Powell's Mill and that he call on Jacob Blevins, Guy Rowe, John A. Rowe,</p>

              <p>Occupation: Farmer</p>
              <p>Notes for LOUISA STEELE:</p>
              <p>After Huffman's death in the Civil War Louisa applied for the children and</p>
              <p>herself. However, Louisa could not read or write. When she and Huffman were</p>
              <p>married the Justice of Peace, James Hamilton, mistakenly entered her name</p>
              <p>on the marriage certificate as Malissa. The War Department denied her</p>
              <p>claim. Only after numerous statements and documents were submitted proving</p>
              <p>she was Huffman's widow did the War Department validate her claim. The War</p>
              <p>Department granted her a pension of eight dollars per month plus two</p>
              <p>dollars per month for each child under the age of sixteen back dated to</p>
              <p>November 10, 1863.</p>
              <p>It appears that Louisa's parents died when she was about four years old.</p>
              <p>John Coleman was named her guardian and his name appears in her marriage</p>

              <p><strong>5.</strong> WILLIAM H.5 ROWE <i>(HUFFMAN</i>4<i>, STEPHEN</i>3<i>, JAMES ROWE</i>2 <i>SR., ROWE</i>1<i>)</i> was born January 16, 1847 in Lawrence Co., Ohio, and died May 19, 1925 in Lookout, Pike Co. Ky.. He married (1) SARAH E. PHILLIPS January 26, 1871 in Pike Co. Ky.. She died in Pike Co. Ky.. He married (2) DICY HALL 1915.</p>
              <p>Notes for WILLIAM H. ROWE:</p>
              <p>William was born in Lawrence County, Ohio. William is a twin to James and</p>
              <p>was illegitimate. He was a Deacon at the Pine Grove Old Regular Baptist</p>
              <p>Church in the late 1800's. The Church house is still in use at the same</p>
              <p>location--Poor Bottom of Rockhouse in Pike county. Located at the back of</p>
              <p>the church on the inner wall is a picture of three men identified as</p>
              <p>Deacons. William "Bill" Rowe is one of these men. The Rowe's in Pike County</p>
              <p>were mostly Old Regular Baptist, a part of the Southern Baptist.</p>
              <p>According to the obituary of his brother, they moved to Pike County,</p>
              <p>Kentucky when six (6) months old. William and James are first reported in</p>
              <p>Pike County, census of 1850 in the household of Barbary Rowe (age 69) at</p>
              <p>the age of 3. Also in the same household is Matilda Rowe 30, Francis Rowe</p>
              <p>26, and a four month old male by the name of James S. Rowe. In a house next</p>
              <p>door lived Huffman the son of Barbary, and his wife Louisa Rowe. In the</p>
              <p>census of 1860 Matilda Rowe, William and James, who are now 13, are living</p>
              <p>with Huffman and Louisa Rowe and three other children. Family tradition</p>
              <p>reports the "a man by the name of Mays is their father, but William and</p>
              <p>James were raised by a man named Rowe". I cannot prove or disapprove this</p>
              <p>statement. However, I can reasonably state that Huffman Rowe was the man</p>
              <p>that raised them. I cannot without doubt determine who is the mother of</p>
              <p>William and James. In this report I have listed Louisa as the mother. At</p>
              <p>least they were raised in her household.</p>
              <p>Obituary:</p>
              <p>Brother William Rowe was born January 16, 1647 and died May 19, 1925. He</p>
              <p>married Sarah on January 26, 1871. To their union was born 10 children,</p>
              <p>five still living. He joined the Pine Grove Old Regular Church in 1873. He</p>
              <p>was soon afterwards made a Deacon and served faithfully in that capacity</p>
              <p>until it pleased the Lord to take him from the shores of time, which was</p>
              <p>near unto 50 years.</p>
              <p>On Monday, the day before he died, he told the writer of a vision, in which</p>
              <p>he said the Lord sent a messenger to show him the beautiful home to which</p>
              <p>he was going, and he said he longed to go. And when one of his dons gave</p>
              <p>him water he stated, "I want water from the fountain of living water".</p>
              <p>About 30 minutes before he died he called his brother James Rowe, who had</p>
              <p>been dead many years, and addressed him as a good brother, as if his</p>
              <p>brother in spirit had come to him at the end of his weary pilgrimage to</p>
              <p>accompany his spirit to his home beyond the skies. On Saturday before his</p>
              <p>departure he called his children and step children and asked them to meet</p>
              <p>him in Heaven. They all had a very high regard for their father, and their</p>
              <p>loss is great, but we wish to say to them, "You should not sorrow as those</p>
              <p>who have no hope, for while his body is sleeping beneath the sod, his soul</p>
              <p>is resting in the sweet smiles of a crucified redeemer. He is no longer</p>
              <p>present and no longer has to bear the hard trials of this world with which</p>
              <p>you and I have to battle, in which he met so bravely. He said he would like</p>
              <p>to see the Pine Grove Church come to peace, but that he would rather suffer</p>
              <p>his head sundered from his body than have unclean spirits to enter her".</p>
              <p>His body was laid to rest beneath the flowers of May beside his dear</p>
              <p>companion who has been dead many years. Many friends attended. He was</p>
              <p>married a second time to Dicy Hill, widow of William Hill, who is still</p>
              <p>living.</p>
