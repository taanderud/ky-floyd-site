          <h3>Descendants of Isaac Little</h3>
          <p><strong><i>Information provided by Jackie Little.</i></strong></p>
          <h4>Generation No. 1</h4>
          <p><i><strong>1.</strong> I</i>SAAC1 LITTLE was born Abt 1755, and died December 1823 in KY. He married
            WINNEY. &nbsp; Notes In the 1773 Delinquent Tax Lists of Fincastle County, VA, it lists Isaac Little,
            Patrick Johnson, and Ephraim Osborn, all are ancesters of Jim Little. I found an Isaac Little in Russell
            County, VA in 1790 in the list of Personal Property. In 1810 Russell County, VA, I found William and Sarah
            Little listed. Isaac Little's Will was probated in Court Jan. 1824 in Pike County, KY, so I am assuming he
            died the month before. James Roberts was the administrator of Isaac's Will, even though Isaac seemed to have
            children and his wife in the area, although they may have been gone at the time. He didn't mention any names
            in his Will, just said wife and children. Peter Little of Clay and Wolfe County, KY is listed in the 1820
            Floyd County, KY census with Isaac, James W., and William Little, so it is a possibility that he could be a
            relative someway. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Children of Isaac Little and Winney are:</p>
          <p>2. i. ELIZABETH2 LITTLE, b. Abt 1779; d. Aft 1850.</p>
          <p>3. ii. WILLIAM LITTLE, SR., b. Abt 1785, VA; d. September 16, 1853, Pike County, KY.</p>
          <p>4. iii. JAMES W. LITTLE, b. Abt 1790, SC; d. 1862, Blount County, AL.</p>
          <p>5. iv. AGNES LITTLE, b. Abt 1792; d. Perry County, KY.</p>
          <p>v. SARAH LITTLE, b. Bef 1800; m. MARSHALL MULLINS, September 19, 1811, Floyd County, KY.</p>
          <p><i><strong>Generation No. 2</strong></i> </p>
          <p><i><strong>2.</strong> E</i>LIZABETH2 LITTLE <i>(ISAAC1) was born Abt 1779, and died Aft 1850. She married
              D</i>AVID BRANHAM, JR. June 06, 1803 in Floyd County, KY, son of David Branham and Susan Burbridge.</p>
          <p>&nbsp; Children of Elizabeth Little and David Branham are:</p>
          <p>6. i. JAMES3 BRANHAM, b. Abt 1804.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>3. W</strong>ILLIAM2 LITTLE, SR. <i>(ISAAC1) was born Abt 1785 in VA, and died September 16, 1853
              in Pike County, KY. He married (1) D</i>ORCAS MULLINS. He married (2) BETSY TERRILL January 10, 1817 in
            Floyd County, KY. He married (3) ELIZABETH SWINNEY/GIBSON?&nbsp; June 08, 1828 in Pike County, KY, daughter
            of ? Gibson and Betsy.</p>
          <p>&nbsp; Notes</p>
          <p>Dorcus (Mullins) Kelley and William Little lived together for about 3 years according to the court records.
            Kesiah Davis testified Dec. 1817 that Dorcas went to bed with Henry Davis and Hiram G. Walters and Dorcas
            had son Bill. Isaac Little testified that Dorcus said her son was son of William Little. Robert Large
            testified that Dorcas (Mullins) Kelley and William Little bed together as man and wife for three years, and
            that Dorcas said her child was William Little's. John Kelley, father of John Kelley, Jr. testified that
            Darkey Kelley, wife of John Kelley, Jr. lived with William Little. We don't know what happened to the child.
            William Little married Betsy Jan. 1817 so all this took place after William quickly married someone else.

          <p>&nbsp; Notes</p>
          <p>Shortly after marriage, moved to Lexington, KY; then to Blount County, AL. James died from a fall off a
            fence into a deep ditch in Alabama. We don't have proof that James is a son, but beings there don't seem to
            be any other Littles in the county, we are putting him in as a son of Isaac until someone can prove
            otherwise.</p>

          <p>&nbsp; Notes</p>
          <p>According to Amil Little, Moses was the son of Samuel Little, but we found no evidence of that. He said
            that this Samuel came from the Yadkin Valley with Daniel Boone expedition. which Daniel Boone would be too
            early for this fellow. We might want to check and see if Isaac Little, the oldest Little in the Floyd County
            area might be a son of Samuel Little which the dates would be more correct. I found a James A. Little born
            April 8, 1855 in Pike County, KY birth records and the father is Moses Little and the mother is Cleminda
            Arten. This is the only Moses it could be, but I don't recognize the mother. This may be a baseboard child.

            his death certificate, so I don't know which date is correct. His death certificate is very hard to read and
            he could have died in 1936 or 1937. One place they wrote 1936 and another place 1937.</p>

          <p>Sillar Johnson had two daughters, Sarah Belle Little fathered by Gus Little, and Mary Dorcus Little
            fathered by Mr. Blackburn, but she never married the fathers. Ben gave his name to both girls. These girls

          <p>&nbsp; Notes</p>
          <p>His birth record says his parents are Francis Little and Martha Hamilton. Richard's two sons, Chris and
            Alvis don't add up. Maybe they adjusted Chris' birth to add up with the marriage record and he was really
            born in Dec. 1879 would make more sense.</p>
