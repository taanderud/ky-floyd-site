  <p>(The following article appeared over several issues of the Floyd County Times, beginning with April 4, 1963 - Page 2, Sec. 2.) Pioneer Beaver Creek Settler Carved Home In Wilderness by Henry P. Scalf (This history of the Stephens family was written from a compilation of data gathered by Henry Stephens, of Prestonsburg, and his son, Edgar P. Stephens. This article is the first of a series.) Samuel Stephens, progenitor of the Big Sandy branch of the family, emerges to history on the Floyd County, Kentucky, records when he married Florence Patton, July 26, 1821. Whether he was a child when he left Virginia and was brought to Kentucky by his parents or other relatives, or like many stalwart young men of the time immigrated westward by his own decision is not known. There were others of the Stephens name in early Floyd County when Samuel Stephens and Florence Patton married. On December 11, that year, Andrew Stephens and Susanna Williams were united in wedlock. It is presumed Samuel and Andrew were brothers. It was Jacob Mayo, deputy clerk of the Floyd County Court for many years, and afterwards clerk himself for years, who issued the marriage license and accepted the security that authorized the union of Samuel Stephens and Florence Patton. The license may be found recorded in marriage book No. 1, page 158, being number 692 in the county since the records were rehabilitated after the courthouse burned in 1808. It reads: "This shall license and permit you to join in marriage according to the rites and ceremonies of the church to which you belong Samuel Stephens and Florence Patton and for this shall be your sufficient warrant. Given under my hand this 21st day of July, 1821. Jacob Mayo, D.C.F.C.C." The marriage return was made by Stephen Harper, J.P., who wrote: "I hereby certify that the within named couple was this day joined together in marriage as the law directs by me, this 26th day of July, 1821." Samuel Stephens at the time of his marriage was 20 years old, having been born November 11, 1801, in that part of Russell County, Virginia, that became Wise county in 1856. His wife, one year older, was the daughter of James Patton and Florence Graham Patton, early Beaver Creek settlers. In the first quarter of the nineteenth century land available for preemption in early Floyd was plentiful, except for the river bottoms. The huge John Preston survey of 100,000 acres had encircled a line around the Big Sandy River bottoms from the mouth of Johns Creek upstream for many miles but in the main the bottoms of the larger tributary streams were untouched. Samuel Stephens and Florence Patton Stephens settled on Stephens Branch, near the present Alphoretta, gave their family name to the stream. In that almost unbroken sylvan barony of thousands of acres of land they raised 15 children and a foster daughter. The Big Sandy valley in 1821 was sparsely settled. Only the year before Samuel Stephens married did anyone claim and settle on the bottoms where Martin now stands. Prestonsburg was a struggling little village of less than 50 persons. Pikeville was unheard of and long valleys, like the one where Stephens settled, were empty except for primeval trees and abundant game. All the children of Samuel and Florence Patton Stephens lived to adulthood which was unusual indeed for, in the semi-wilderness of early Floyd County, the hazards of life and the lack of proper medical care lessened the survival rate. There were fields to clear of giant timber, long hours of almost intolerable toil in and outside the house, and epidemics of small pox that swept the land. Life was hard and back-breaking labor was eternal. Around the Stephens home the virgin timber yielded to cleared fields and Samuel rapidly added to his original acres by additional patents. In time the early homesite had grown to mammoth proportions. But this preoccupation of Samuel with land acquisition was for a laudable purpose. He was providing for his posterity, left each of his children several hundred, a few, thousands of acres. The order of birth of the Stephens children cannot be given. We know that Jenny, daughter of Florence, was born about 1818, possibly 1819. She was reared by Samuel and Florence, took their name, and reaching maturity, married John Stone, October 29, 1837. Her husband, while at work on Turkey Creek, cut his leg with an axe. He bled to death. Jenny, now a widow with five children, remarried Andrew J. Canady, bore him four children. Descendants of this later union now bear the name Kennedy. Rebecca Stephens, one of the older daughters of Samuel and Florence, married George W. (Hopkins) Allen, April 28, 1840. They had sixteen children. George W. Stephens, one of the older sons, married Margaret Handshoe, July 24, 1844. He settled on the Caney Fork of Middle Creek and reared ten children and died about 1900. William D. Stephens married Rebecca Bradley, November 3, 1857, and were the parents of eleven children. Reuben Stephens married Nancy Jane Hicks, April 21, 1859, and continuing the tradition of large families in the Stephens sept, had twelve children. It is not known to whom Alexander Stephens was married. He, contrary to the dominant southern feeling of his kinsmen, joined the Union army in either Ohio or Illinois, served through the Civil War as an officer. He came back to Stephens Branch after the war was over, willing to forget the differences with his people. But his brothers were a bit embittered by the war, and Alexander left for the west. It was rumored that he died in the Chicago fire in 1871, but this fear proved groundless. Decades later a son came back to Kentucky from Oklahoma to inquire about the division of the estate of his grandfather but finding no provision had been made for Alexander, returned to Oklahoma. Knowledge of this family does not exist with the Big Sandy Stephens descendants. First to marry after the Civil War from the patriarchal home of Samuel Stephens was Mary. October 11, 1865, she was married to David Osborne. To this union were born eight children. Samuel A. Stephens married an Osborne also, presumably a sister to David. Samuel A. and Sarah Osborne were united in marriage, October 10, 1866, and to them were born fourteen children. John Stephens, born 1836, was never married. He was lured westward by the news of the California gold rush and did not return until about 1907 or 1908. ___________________________________ Sons of Pioneer Stephens Were Divided In Civil War (This is the second in a series of articles on the Stephens family compiled from data gathered by Henry Stephens and his son, Edgar P. Stephens.) The years, between 1821 when Samuel Stephens and Florence Patton were married and the outbreak of the Civil War, was a period of time that historians designate as the log cabin development period in the Big Sandy valley. The pole cabin of the pioneer settlers disappeared and the more commodious hewed-log home appeared in its place. There were a few added utilitarian comforts in these homes all produced with great labor. The Stephens home, typical of those built by the landed settlers, grew to large proportions to house the 16 children. Early, though, many of this big family began to marry and left the paternal hearthstone, but the younger grew and it is a fair inference that the Stephens Branch home was full for years. There was talk of war and the young men, some married, chose sides in the bitter sectional strike, imitating their elders who were vocal on the questions of the day. Came 1861 and Col. Andrew Jackson May began recruiting soldiers for the Confederacy at Prestonsburg. Although George had been married since 1844 and William had taken a wife four years before they both enlisted to fight for the South. Alexander didn't share the prosouthern sympathies of his two older brothers and left home to cast his lot with the Union. Tradition, usually unreliable but often indicating the basic truth, asserts that Alexander was a brilliant man and had acquired considerable education. He taught school for several years and it is said that a few years before the Civil War he, George and Reuben went west. They became separated, according to this tradition, and the three never saw each other until after the close of the war. George Stephens had several children before he entered the Confederate army but we are unsure as to the number. Both George and and William joined Co. B 13th Calvary Regiment, C.S.A, that Col. May had formed. The date was October 9, 1862. The next day, the reason not stated, both men left Co. B, went over to Company F and remained in that group until the war ended. Alexander, their brother was out west, in either Ohio or Illinois, and soon joined the Federal forces. Neither were to see each other until after Lee surrendered when Alexander came back to Stephens Branch, found his brothers, perhaps others of the family, cool to his service as a Union soldier. He left again for the west and only vague rumors came back that he went to Indian Territory, married an Indian chief's daughter, and lived out his life on the Oklahoma prairie. George Stephens, who married Margaret Handshoe, settled on the Caney Fork of Middle Creek. Little is known about Margaret Handshoe's family, except that she was from Salt Lick, on Right Beaver Creek. Her mother was a Prater and one of her sisters married William Coburn, and another married Alexander Coburn. Children of the union of George and Margaret Stephens were Alexander, married Delila Hale, daughter of Samuel Hale and Eda Helton Hale; Harrison married Rebecca Allen, daughter of James Allen who lived in the head of the Left Fork of Middle Creek; Martha married Morgan Baldridge, and settled on Jones Fork, near the present Lackey but left years later and went to Rowan County; Henry C. married first to Fannie Hicks and after her death Alice Risner; Darcus married Daniel Wicker, of Jones Fork where they lived and died; Florence married James Bradley; Minerva married Alexander Hamilton and went to housekeeping on the Caney Fork of Middle Creek where they lived and died; Cynthia married Jefferson Justice, and upon his death remarried Joe Morgan Thornsberry; Polly Ann married Hager Ousley, lived and died on Caney Fork; Samuel married first Catherine Coburn and after her demise married Rachel Bradley. Jennie, the foster child of Samuel Stephens and daughter of his wife Florence, married John Stone and to them were born these children: Cynthia Stone married a Goodman; James married Polly McDaniels; Sally died not married; Nancy married Henry Patton and after his death married Jack Howard; and Florence who married Thomas Conley. After the untimely death of John Stone from an accident on Turkey Creek she remarried Andrew J. Canady and to them were born four children; Dave Canady married Florence Stephens, daughter of Thomas and Nancy Jane Hicks Stephens; Mary Canady married Gobe Compton; Lige, a great fiddler and variety musician, who was never married; Rebecca married Jack Hale. Rebecca Stephens, who married George W. (Hopkins) Allen in 1840, was the first of the many children of Samuel Stephens to die. She and George Allen were the parents of 16 children: Mary married Edward Halley; Louisa married James Halley; William; James P., born 1859, married Sally May, born 1854, died 1921, Amanda married B.L.C. May, born November 4, 1859, died January 8, 1952; John B.; Florence married William Pratt; Susan married Milton Spears; David; Darcus married John Galloway; Robert; Andrew married Florence Stephens, daughter of Reuben; Alexander married Elizabeth Stephens, of the William Stephens line, August 8, 1884; Rebecca married S.P. (Boge) Ratliff; Reuben died young; and Samuel who also succumbed in his youth. Reuben M. Stephens, who married Nancy Jane Hicks in 1859, resided on Stephens Branch. Their 12 children were Solomon G., married Martha Hale; Mary Ann married Wilson Shepherd, December 7, 1882. Cynthia married Johnnie Patton, March 16, 1889; Francis married Joe Shepherd; John E. married Mary Hale, sister to Martha Hale who married Solomon G. Stephens; Florence married Andrew Allen; Rebecca married Jake Crisp; Darcus married Will Haywood and lived and died on Spurlock Fork of Middle Creek; G.C. (Cleve) married Catherine Bailey, who died in 1956; Malcolm married first to Mary Howard, second to Rebecca Maggard, third to Delilah Moore and fourth to Draxie Vance; Jennie married George Bailey; and Isabelle who married Lewis Howard, November 24, 1888. James P. Stephens, born January 25, 1825, died February 29, 1904, married Cynthia May, who was born June 7, 1835, died December 9, 1869. Ten children were born to this union before Cynthia died. James P. and all of his children with the exception of James A., a babe, left Beaver Creek soon after the mother's death and moved to Kansas. Jame A. was reared by his uncle and aunt, George and Mahalia Hagans May and assumed the name of his foster parents. Sons and daughters of James P. and Cynthia May Stephens were George J., married Alma Hindee Vaughan, October 23, 1901; Willam H. married Levisa Jane Stufflebean, April 12, 1883; David married Causetta Osborne, December 31, 1891; Solomon married Hettie Epley, March 1, 1890; Reuben and John died in infancy; Daniel W. married Martha Patton, February 8, 1872; Marcus L. married Anne May Constable. Solomon May and a few members of his immediate family returned to Kentucky three years ago after an absence of half a century. William Stephens, who married Rebecca Bradley, was the father of 11 children; Susan married Felix J. May; Samuel married Mary Hale; Isaac N. married Ann Flannery; Dollie, married Pharis Crisp; Elizabeth married Alexander Allen; Polly married Jack Patton; Florence married Hiram Bradley; Eli married Fannie Patton and after her death married Myrtle Curnutte; Alexander married Angie Harman, and moved west; Darcus married Starling Gibson; Cynthia married first Wesley Ratliff and second Ned Ousley. Cynthia died on Caney Fork. John Stephens, one of the older sons of Samuel Stephens, never married. He went to California in the Gold Rush but returned to die in the Big Sandy. __________________________________________ Underneath Vast Stephens Farm Lay Huge Reserves of Minerals (This is the third article in a series on the Stephens family.) John Stephens, one of the sons of Samuel Stephens and Florence Patton Stephens, who went heading for California in the Gold Rush, had no inkling that underneath land on the waters of Beaver and Middle Creek lay a fortune at home in coal and natural gas. John, who never married, returned from the west, a bit disillusioned about far-off wealth and knowing nothing of "black diamonds" and the other hidden minerals of the mountains, sold his part of his father's estate to one of the other heirs. But whether John Stephens or any of the heirs of the Stephens estate knew of it or not a vast storehouse of mineral wealth, awaiting development, was under the 16,000 acres of the Stephens barony. Stephens Branch, approximately three miles long, all of the Caney Fork of Middle Creek down to what oldsters called the Cold Spring, and hundreds of acres of bottom on main Beaver lay under a title to Samuel and Florence Stephens. They, too, had little conception of the vast resources under their land. Decades later the Bailey-Ferguson Coal Company and soon afterward the May Coal Company began development. Today the Stephens Elkhorn Fuel Corporation, successor the May Coal Company, is exploiting part of the original; Stephens farm. It is said that none of Samuel Stephens' heirs reaped any large reward from the land. Most of them were restless and, people said, stubborn. They wanted to leave the old home site, look for wealth and a good life elsewhere. Development of the natural resources of Big Sandy was coming, though, before Samuel and Florence died. In the eighties a railway pushed up the valley to Peach Orchard, finally to Whitehouse. Timber merchants swarmed on the main stream and looked up into the tributary valleys. Giant walnut trees were bought for a song. In a few years other buyers returned to dig up the stumps. While Samuel Stephens was approaching the last years of his life, logging became the concern of many prominent Big Sandians and Catlettsburg grew to the largest hardwood market in the world. It held that lead for a decade or more. All of the many sons and daughters of Samuel Stephens were married before 1880, with the exception of John who had gone west. The Stephens Branch home was never empty, though, for grandchildren were constant inmates. Samuel Stephens, after a vigorous old age, died, July 24, 1887. His widow survived until 1890. Both were buried in the cemetery that bears the Stephens name, on a point near the residence of the late B.L.C. May, who married a granddaughter. In this pine-covered cemetery, others, who like Samuel and Florence Stephens pioneered the development of homes in the community, lie buried. A black-topped road trails along now at the foot of the hill, going up Stephens Branch and down Caney Fork. In Samuel's day it was a wagon-rutted trail. Eight children of the old pioneer whose marriages and children were not listed in former articles of this series are Thomas, Samuel A., Mary, Cynthia, Andrew, David, Morgan G., and Darcus P. Thomas married Nancy Jane Bradley, March 15, 1852, and had 12 children. They were Susannah, married Isaac F. Flannery, April 13, 1876, and upon his death married Sam England; Florence married David A. Canady, November 30, 1871; Isaac married Malinda Yates; Samuel married Rebecca Castle, November 19, 1890, and after her death married Sophie Whitaker, December 22, 1919, and following her death married Mary Salmons, June 2, 1923, and later married Rosa (Wireman) Handshoe; Reuben A. married Nancy Haywood, December 28, 1881 and upon his death she married Thomas Ratliff, September 29, 1894.

Cynthia and Rebecca Osborne were twins. Cynthia Stephens married Samuel Hale and to them were born only one child which died in infancy. This was a second marriage of Samuel Hale, he having married Eda Helton whose mother was a Wireman, before his marriage to Cynthia Stephens. There were eight children born to this first marriage of Samuel Hale. The eldest, James Hale, emigrated west where the nearest railway to the Big Sandy was Cincinnatti and it was necessary to go there by steamboat. Arriving in Kansas City, Missouri, the western railway terminal, he found himself with only fifty cents. James Hale, the oldest, died a few years ago in Waynoka, Oklahoma, possessed of vast real estate holdings, one ranch alone having 35,000 acres on the Cimarron River. He survived all of his brothers and sisters. In 1926 he returned to the Big Sandy to visit his relatives, the only time he ever came back. Other sons and daughters of Samuel Hale and Eda Helton Hale were A.J. Hale, died at Verdigris, Oklahoma; B.B. Hale, died at Cody, Nebraska; John who emigrated to Missouri, but returned to die in Floyd county; Vinson Hale, who went to Oklahoma but had his legs broken in a wagon wheel and died from the effects of the injury; Delilah born 1875, died August, 1933 married Alexander Stephens, born July 15, 1865, died December 30, 1953, having married in 1889; Mary married Samuel Stephens and died in Webster county, Missouri.

She succumbed near Printer, September 24, 1924. __________________________________________ Samuel Stephens' Descendants Participated In Public Affairs (This is the fourth article on the Stephens family compiled from data gathered by Henry Stephens and his son, Edgar P. Stephens.) In the century and half since Samuel Stephens, the progenitor of the Big Sandy family, was born in Virginia several thousand descendants have lived, carved out their destinies and either passed on or live today to claim him as an ancestor. Many engaged in business or went into the professions, notably the law. Others sought public office and served in various official capacities in local or district government. There were physicians, a number were teachers. David Stephens, son of Samuel and Florence Stephens, who married Margaret Daniels, was elected county judge and also served as county surveyor of Floyd county. His son Albert, of Prestonsburg, was elected Commonwealth's Attorney of the 31st judicial district. Claude P. Stephens, son of Albert was elected and served as Commonwealth's Attorney for the same judicial district from 1922 to 1934. He was named United States Assistant District Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and in a few years succeeded Sawyer Smith as District Attorney. John Stephens, of Water Gap, son of Morgan Green Stephens and Malinda J.
