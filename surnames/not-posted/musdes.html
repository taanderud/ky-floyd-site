              <p>They had six sons and three daughters. George is possibly a desendant of John Musick who came from England on the ship Amitie before the middle of the 17th century. George Sr. was granted 300 acres of land in Spotsylvania County, Virginia on September 8, 1728 (probably from the King of England).

              <p>They had the following children: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ephriam MUSICK Sr.-380 was born about 1724 and died about 1754. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elexious (Electxious) MUSICK-297 was born about 1718 in Spotsyvania, , Virginia, USA. He died about 1798 in Russel, Virginia, USA. In the County Court Orders of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, in 1766 land was surveyed for Elexious (Electxious) Musick.&nbsp; On the 3rd Monday of January, 1777, all free males over the age of 16 years were asked to sign the Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America.&nbsp; The names of my g-g-g grandfather Archibald Prater and his brother, Jonathon Prater and Elexious Musick were on this list.&nbsp; The name of Elexious Music appeared on the tax lists of Henry County, Virginia in the years of 1782-1787.&nbsp; Jonathon Prater married Elizabeth Musick.&nbsp; Don't know if any of these earlier Musicks are connected to your Musics or not. I have also seen the name Auxier in the early Virginia and Kentucky records, but can't find it right now. Hope this will be of some help to you.&nbsp; This information was from Mel Harbison, E-mail address, harbison@flash.net</p>

              </ul>
              <p>BIRTH: Birthdate from the Kentucky 1880 census. Kentucky 1880 census has the first name as Eligah. Marriage to July Vaughn in 1888 as listed in Floyd County Ky. Marriage Bond Book, 4,5,6 & 7 by Joe Skeens. DEATH: Death information taken from Mormon films, marriage bonds v. 6-7, 1878-1893 number 0837284 and vital stastistics number 0216823. Bobby W. Wells report lists a marriage to Margaret E. Sesco. Need to check this out. The previous data is correct, based on what my father told me about my grandparents. Wallace F. Music Jr.-3. Joe R. Skeens's East Kentucky Cemeteries, Vol. XII shows a Lige Music died 1888 and buried at Auxier Relocation or Jenny Wiley Lake Cemetery. This date is realistic based on information from his son Wallace F. Music Jr. Elijah married (MRIN:33) Julia VAUGHN-100, daughter of John Jefferson VAUGHN-95 and Synthia Alice HILL-96 (MRIN:32), about 1888 in Floyd, Kentucky, USA. Julia was born about 1867 in , , Kentucky, USA. BIRTH: She died sometime after 1889 or maybe at the time she gave birth to her only child, Wallace Frank Music. The Floyd County Kentucky Marriage Bond Book, 4,5,6&amp;7 have Julia's name as July.</p>
              <p>Elijah and Julia had the following children: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 272&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wallace Frank MUSIC-1 was born 6 Aug 1889 and died 29 Jun 1941. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

              </ul>
              <p>MARRIAGE: Married at the home of Andrew R. Music Marion was 17 years old and his bride was 20 years old when they were married. They were married by A. R. Music at his home. BIRTH: Birth date Apr 1872 was taken from Floyd County Marriage Bond Book by Joe Skeens, Page 101. The gravestone shows a date of 1960. Bobby W. Wells report shows a marriage to a Mary A. Bays, b. Abt 1879 and married 4/16/1894. Need some checking on this marriage. Marion married (MRIN:64) Caroline SETSER-62, daughter of Samuel SETZER-387 and Elizabeth CRIDER-388 (MRIN:138), on 26 Jul 1889 in Floyd, Kentucky, USA. Caroline was born about 1871 in Floyd, Kentucky, USA. She died about 1926. BIRTH: Don't remember where the May 1874 birthdate came from.&nbsp; The birthdate of 1871 and her death as 1926 came from the gravestone. DEATH: Believe she was buried with her husband at the Rainey Valley Cemetery at Glenoma, Lewis, Washington, because her name was listed on the gravestone.</p>
              <p>Marion and Caroline had the following children: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 273&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emily MUSICK-171 was born 30 Mar 1890 and died 26 Aug 1956. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 274&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew MUSICK-196 was born Mar 1893 and died about 1971. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 275&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James MUSICK-197 was born Jul 1894. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 276&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garmicel MUSICK-199 was born Feb 1897 in Kentucky, USA. The 1900 Floyd County, Kentucky census is hard to read. The name Carmicel is the best I can read. The birthdate was marked over, but looks like either a 1 or a 7. A 7 would agree with the rest of the chrological listing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 277&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perry MUSIC-61 was born 10 Jul 1898 and died 4 Feb 1980. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 278&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elizabeth MUSICK-200 was born 1 Jul 1901 and died 5 Feb 1975. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 279&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam MUSICK-201 was born 17 Feb 1899 and died 11 Dec 1973. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 280&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viii.&nbsp;&nbsp; William MUSICK-202 was born 15 May 1906 in Floyd, Kentucky, USA.

              <p>The Archibald Music family arrived at Morton, Washington in 1908. According to Archibald, the Music's came from Holland. He also said the Music name was previously Musick. Archibald was named after his father. The above comments were stated by his son, Wallace H. Music. Bobby W. Wells report lists the marriage on Abt 1879. Calvin had twelve grand children and sixteen great grand children when he passed away. Calvin married (MRIN:4) Annie Laura VAUGHN-10, daughter of John Jefferson VAUGHN-95 and Synthia Alice HILL-96 (MRIN:32), on 18 Apr 1894 in Prestonburg, Floyd, Kentucky, USA. The marriage ended in divorce. Annie was born about 1879 in Prestonburg, Floyd, Kentucky, USA. She died 30 Sep 1947 in Olympia, Thurston, Washington, USA. Two marriage dates are noted in the fiche file for Kentuky, Mormon church. 10 Apr 1894 and 18 Apr 1894.&nbsp; Based on the Floyd Co. marriage records the 18 April 1894 date is correct. Annie was 15 years old at the time of her marriage per Floyd Co. marriage records. She married a Mr. Manning and they lived on Fones Road in Olympia, Washington.</p>
