                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>On December 13, 1799, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation to form Floyd County as the 40th county of Kentucky. The county was made from parts of <a href="http://kykinfolk.org/fleming/">Fleming,</a> Montgomery, and <a href="http://kykinfolk.com/mason/">Mason</a> County, Kentucky. The legislation became effective on June 1, 1800. Final Boundary was formed in 1884.</p>
                    <p>The county was named for James John Floyd. The county seat was Preston's Station, located on the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River and was later renamed Prestonsburg. It was founded in 1797. The first court house burned down on April 8, 1808, destroying all the early records, so the earliest records of government activity come from the year 1808. The first post office opened in 1816 as Floyd Court House.</p>
                    <p>Prestonsburg was used as a Confederate stronghold during the Civil War and two battles took place nearby: the Battle of Ivy Mountain on November 8, 1861 and the Battle of Middle Creek on January 10, 1862. Both were Union victories.</p>
                    <p>Also located in Prestonsburg is the <a href="http://mayhouse.org/">May House.</a> Built in 1817, it is the oldest brick house in the Big Sandy valley and is currently being restored.</p>

              <p>The KYGenWeb Project</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March and April, 1996, a group of genealogists organized the Kentucky Comprehensive Genealogy Database. The idea was to provide a single entry point for all counties in Kentucky, where collected databases would be stored. In addition, the databases would be indexed and cross-linked, so that even if an individual were found in more than one county, they could be located in the index.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, volunteers were found who were willing to coordinate the collection of databases and generally oversee the contents of the web page.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><a href="mailto:kemp@netnitco.net">Jeff Kemp</a></strong> <a href="mailto:ldrbelties@earthlink.net"></a>is the coordinator for the state of Kentucky. If you are interested in hosting a county page or helping to host one, please contact one of them.</p>
