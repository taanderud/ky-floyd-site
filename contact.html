<u>I am here to assist you</u>. I maintain this web site as a volunteer for the KYGenWeb Project. 
My role is to maintain this site. If your family research includes the same as my own family 
(<a href="http://ky-family-stories.com/" target="_blank">Mann, Watkins, Howard, Salyer, Hudson, and Spencer to name a few</a>)
then I might be able to assist with some answers. Thank you for your understanding<br /><br />


<h2>Do you have a question about specifc information on this site?</h2><br />
<div style="margin:0 2%">
The majority of the information contained on this site was here LONG before I became 
coordinator. There is little documentation other than what you is presented here.  
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="fixem('1')">Click here to email me</a><input type="reset" disabled="disabled" style="display:none;" id="1" value="Breathitt Co. Question">.  
Please be as specific as possible and if you are referring to information on a specific page please include a link to that page.
</div>

<br />
<h2>Do you have a correction to submit?</h2><br />
<div style="margin:0 2%">
Thank you!  
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="fixem('2')">Click here to email me</a><input type="reset" disabled="disabled" style="display:none;" id="2" value="Breathitt Co. Correction">.  
Please be as specific as possible and if you are referring to information on a specific page please include a link to that page.  
Also, please include any information you may have that supports the reason for a change. 
For example if you are submitting a database change to an individual's birth or death or marriage or other such change, please include a link 
or links or documents that support the needed change.
</div>

<br />
<h2>Would you like to contribute new information to share with others?</h2><br />
<div style="margin:0 2%">
Thank you!  
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="fixem('3')">Click here to email me</a><input type="reset" disabled="disabled" style="display:none;" id="3" value="Breathitt Co. Submission">.  
Please include copies of everything you would like added to our site.  If you 
would like your information linked to a specific family please include a link from our web site to the family in question.  <b>All contributions 
are welcome and wanted!</b>  No amount of information is too much or too little.
</div>

<br />
<h2>Would you like to add or remove a listing on the Research Requests page?</h2><br />
<div style="margin:0 2%">
Great!
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="fixem('4')">Click here to email me</a><input type="reset" disabled="disabled" style="display:none;" id="4" value="Breathitt Co. Research Request Page">.  
The more information you can provide the better the chance of getting a reply from someone. 
Also, when you send a request to be added to the Research Requests page you are giving me your permission to add your name, your email address, and 
your request to that page.
