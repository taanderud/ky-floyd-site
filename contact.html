                    <p> I am here to assist you. I maintain this web site as a volunteer for the KYGenWeb Project. My
                        role is to maintain this site. If your family research includes the same as my own family (<a
                            href="http://ky-family-stories.com/">Mann, Watkins, Howard, Salyer, Hudson, and Spencer to
                            name a few</a>) then I might be able to assist with some answers. Thank you for your
                        understanding. </p>
                    <h3>Do you have a question about specifc information on this site?</h3>
                    <p> The majority of the information contained on this site was here LONG before I became
                        coordinator. There is little documentation other than what you is presented here. Please be as
                        specific as possible and if you are referring to information on a specific page please include a
                        link to that page. </p>
                    <h3>Do you have a correction to submit?</h3>
                    <p> Thank you! Please be as specific as possible and if you are referring to information on a
                        specific page please include a link to that page. Also, please include any information you may
                        have that supports the reason for a change. For example if you are submitting a database change
                        to an individual's birth or death or marriage or other such change, please <strong>include a
                            link or links or documents that support the needed change.</strong> </p>
