          <h3>(February 4, 1981)</h3>
          <p>If Department of Revenue figures are correct, Floyd County is one of 41 counties in the state that have their 1980 assessments at more than the 100 percent ideal sought by the department. Lovel Hall, Property Valuation Administrator, for this county, doubts they are. Also, if figures released by the department, showing that Floyd County has a 1980 property tax assessment-sales ratio of 107.7 are accurate, Hall said, �I wouldn�t see anything illegal about reducing the assessment total for this county by 7.7 percent, since 100 percent was all they demanded.� Hall sees one cause of the higher assessment-cost ratio as the 18 percent inflation which was imposed by the state last year... This means that a home which sold for $50,000 in 1979, say, would in 1980 have 19 percent, or $9,000, added to its evaluation. �But that is unjust,� he pointed out, because a slower economy and high interest rates kept such an increase in the sale price of such property down. The Department of Revenue has held that if a county�s assessment-sales ratio is within 10 percent of the 100 percent ideal�90 or 110�it is still considered acceptable...
