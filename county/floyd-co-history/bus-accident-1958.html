					<h3>Cause of '58 Bus Disaster Still A Mystery</h3>
					<p>Crash that killed 27 Left Its Mark on Survivors</p>
					<p>Extract from the Lexington Herald-Leader (28-Feb-1988)</p>
					<p>Prestonsburg--The morning of Feb. 28, 1958 was cloudy and cold, but the pavement on old U.S. 23 above
						Lancer was dry. About 7 a.m., bus driver John Alex DeRossett began his usual route from Cow Creek to
						consolidated schools in Prestonsburg, stopping to collect students in the communities of Sugar Loaf
						and Emma. The bus would never reach the schools. It would plunge into Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy
						River, killing 26 students and the bus driver. The crash happened 30 years ago today and remains the
						worst school bus accident in US history.</p>
					<p>DeRossett was on schedule. Unlike an older bus he had driven the day before--a bus one student
						described as having its rear emergency door wired shut--Bus No. 27 had just been serviced. About 8:10
						a.m., three miles east of Prestonsburg at the mouth of Knotley Hollow, DeRossett pulled off the main
						road where two 14-year-old freshman girls, Ezelle Pennington and Joyce Matney, stood hugging their
						books and waiting with six other students. Joyce, a band member, and Ezelle were best friends. both
						wore fashionably long skirts, bobby socks, loafers and sweaters. A week earlier, they had rdred
						identical Easter outfits. Now, they discussed a forthcoming Prestonsburg High School basketball game.
						With them stood Joyce Matney's little sister, Rita Cheryl, 8, who had blue-green eyes and reddish
						hair. Rita Cheryl was "a doll--the prettiest little girl that ever was," said Ezelle Pennington
						Copley, now 44 and a resident of East Point. The eight students climbed aboard. Someone asked Joyce
						Matney what her grandfather's pickup was doing "down there in the ditch line." About 200 yards down
						the highway, a pickup was mired to its axles in the ditch alongside the road. A wrecker driven by
						Donald "Dootney" Horn was maneuvering across the road to pull it out. Because the bus was almost full,
						Joyce and Ezelle took separate seats. Joyce and her little sister took seats near the front of the
						bus, while Ezelle found one near the back, a section routinely reserved for older boys. </p>
					<p>As DeRossett changed gears, Janice Blackburn, 14, sitting with her feet against the top of a rear
						wheel well, loked up from her book. She saw Horn's wrecker and went back to reading. In the back of
						the bus, the older boys spotted the wrecker and someone predicted the bus would hit it, said Donald
						Dillon of Prestonsburg, who was an eighth grader. "He had plenty of time to stop if he'd wanted to.
						Dillon does not recall a collision. But Isaac Vanderpool, then 17, who was sitting behind the driver,
						said that DeRossett yelled when the bus struck the wrecker's left rear bumper and fender. Aroused
						students began screaming, too, when the bus turned a hard left and started toward the river, striking
						a parked car and narrowly missing a trailor owned by Bennie Blackburn, Ezelle Pennington Copley
						remembers watching Blackburn's trailor flash by as the bus slid head-first down the riverbank. "I
						remember thinking, "We're going to hit the trees any second," she said. </p>
