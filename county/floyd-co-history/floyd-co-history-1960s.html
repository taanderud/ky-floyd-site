                        annual Safety Day, sponsored by the Big Sandy-Elkhorn Coal Mining Institute, was held at
                        Pikeville, September 19. First place in the mine rescue division went to Inland Steel Company's
                        Wheelwright mine team. Floyd County received a check, Monday, in the amount of $116,250 from the
                        City of Prestonsburg in payment for the old courthouse property which is to be converted into a
                        parking lot as an urban renewal project. Born: to Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Allen, a daughter, Anna

                    <p>&nbsp;The Floyd County Planning and Development Association was organized August 20, in a meeting
                        held at the office of Clifford B. Latta, as a successor to the Floyd County Planning Committee.
                        An 82-year-old Floyd County man who had been missing 96 hours, and had apparently gone without
                        food during that time, was found near a Right Beaver Creek mountaintop, Monday morning, not only
                        alive, but in what was described as "fair condition". Prestonsburg businessmen envision that the
                        municipally sponsored bus line from Prestonsburg to various points in the county will be in
                        business by October 1. The U.S. Corps of Engineers, at the request of the Kentucky Department of
                        Fish and Wildlife Resources, will start releasing water from Dewey Lake, Nov. 1, in an effort to
                        relieve the over-population of gizzard shad in the impoundment. Prestonsburg defeated the
                        Wheelwright Trojans, 32-12 last week-end, in the Blackcats' opening game of the football season.

                        institution of higher learning, the Prestonsburg Community College, will begin. A modern water
                        system and a safe and adequate water supply for the town of Auxier were discussed at a hearing
                        held here, Saturday, before County Judge Henry Stumbo. The largest of Floyd County's new
                        schools, Clark Elementary, opened Monday, with an enrollment of 595. The new six-classroom
                        building at Harold drew approximately 200 pupils. Four of the general education classes under

                        Nathaniel Moore, of Price, a daughter, Alicia Kay, August 19, at McDowell; to Mr. and Mrs.

                    <h3>August 20, 1964</h3>
                    <p>The Prestonsburg City Council voted, Tuesday night, to purchase from the heirs of the late Hiram
                        Harris, 22 acres of land at the outskirts of West Prestonsburg as a start toward the realization
                        of a community dream of a city park and recreation area. One day's work last week by county,
                        state and federal officers reduced the number of moonshine stills operating in the county by
                        six. As a direct result of lessons learned in Floyd County and seven other areas where the
                        program has been operated on an experimental basis since mid-1961, Congress has decided to
                        expand the food-stamp program. Clifford B. Latta, executive director of the Municipal Housing
                        Commission, said Tuesday, that the work of razing the old Floyd County courthouse may be begun

                        expiration of the miners' vacation period returned to work last week, but a one-day strike at
                        David marred the coal mining picture temporarily. An adult education program with twice-a-week
                        classes is planned under joint sponsorship of the Floyd County Board of Education and the State
                        Department of Education, it was announced, Monday, by James W. Salisbury, program director. The
                        First Presbyterian Church decided by unanimous vote of a congregational meeting, Sunday noon, to
                        sell its Third Avenue church structure and manse to the Roman Catholic Church. The purchase
                        price was $45,000. Born: to Mr. and Mrs. Billy Robinson, of Bull Creek, a daughter, Billie Jean,

                    Harry Ranier, of Prestonsburg, member of the Kentucky Economic Development Board, failed to shake
