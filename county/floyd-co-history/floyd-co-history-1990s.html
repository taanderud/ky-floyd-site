                    <p>&nbsp;Floyd County's solid waste woes could be just beginning, despite what appeared to be the county's saving grace in July, when an Ohio Company took over waste disposal for the county. The Floyd County Solid Waste Commission entered
                        into a five-year agreement with Rumpke of Kentucky, in June, which was touted as a pact to keep residential garbage rates at an affordable $10 per month for the term on the contract. Baretta R. Casey feels she has been penalized
                        for opening a primary care practice in her hometown, Pikeville. Dr. Casey opened a family practice about two months ago, and the investment cost her $200,000. She paid $40,000 down with money she had earned doing extra work during
                        her last two years of residency. She borrowed the rest. Casey wonders how she will keep her office open, if the proposed cuts in Medicaid reimbursement become effective. The Wheelwright City Commission held a meeting on Monday
                        night with an air of mystery. The meeting came to order at 7 p.m., and at ten minutes after seven, the members of the commission went into closed session to talk on the telephone with a representative from Landrum and Shouse Law
                        Offices for approximately 25 minutes. Mayor Marley Sammons later announced that no information about the telephone call would be given out until a later date. An incinerator used to burn medical waste became a hot topic at a meeting
                        of the Floyd County Solid Waste Commission, Monday evening. Attorney Kevin Costetto, representing the company, Medisin, which owns the incinerator, asked the solid waste board to amend its solid waste plan to allow Medisin to take
                        in 561 tons of waste per year. Costetto called the solid waste plans, 100 ton per ten year limit, a "clerical error" because an assistant for Floyd County Judge Executive John M. Stumbo told him "someone had called a facility and
                        was given an amount for ash leaving that facility, not the amount coming in.". Floyd County's Fiscal Court were surprised and appeared upset, Friday, when the architect for the jail project submitted approximately $150,000 in change
                        orders for site work. A trailer fire Saturday evening, at McDowell, killed a 27-year-old Floyd County man. Preliminary autopsy reports indicated that Larry Wayne Collins, of Ned's Fork, died of smoke inhalation. An ongoing undercover
                        investigation by Kentucky State Police culminated in 15 arrests, early Tuesday morning, in three counties, which snagged seven Floyd Countians. State police began rounding up suspected drug dealers on Tuesday morning, and more
                        arrests were expected throughout the week. Floyd County School Board members held firm on their decision that teachers be evaluated each year, but agreed to a proposal that would elimnate a second semester review if teachers make
                        passing grades in the first. The largest Sears Authorized Retail Dealer Store in the eastern district of the United States will open in Prestonsburg, as soon as renovations are completed on the former Sundry Store building. State
                        education officials have rejected the purchase of a site for a Betsy Layne middle school, because the cost and development of the property is projected to exceed 10 percent of the total project cost. State Police have determined
                        that a Floyd County man and two Magoffin County brothers, who were killed in a marijuana field in Breathitt County, September 1, were trying to disarm booby traps, that at least two of the men had placed in the pot patch. In just
                        four days, close to $30,000 in delinquent taxes have been collected by the Floyd County Sheriff's Office, and taxpayers have until today (Friday), to settle up or face stern action. Collection efforts began Monday and most offenders
                        have been cooperative and paid their bills. A Prestonsburg woman was killed Tuesday afternoon, in a two-car accident at the intersection of KY 1428 and U.S. 23, near Prestonsburg. Jean Wallen Dotson, 60, was pronounced dead at
                        the accident scene by Floyd County Coroner Roger Nelson. For the last 28 years Constance Lackey, 93, of Tram, has devoted her time, attention and compassion, to the workings of the Big Sandy Area Community Action Program Inc. (BSACAP).
                        Now, in the same year that community action programs commemorate 30 years of helping people, Constance has received two major awards for her volunteer service with the Big Sandy Area CAP program. The Jenny Wiley Festival will celebrate
                        its 13th year, beginning October 3, with competition, gospel singing, and a concert by the Gibson/Miller Band. There died: Palmer Shepherd, 51, of Columbia City, Indiana, Saturday, September 17, at Whitley County Hospital; Olga

                    <p>&nbsp;A civil suit arising from the May 1993, Democrataic primary election in Floyd County took two unusual turns last week. The first twist came, Thursday, August 18, when the suit's accuser, radio station owner Dale McKinney indicated
                        that he would ask that his complaint against Floyd County Judge-Executive John M. Stumbo be dismissed. Floyd County School Board members are asking for a full report on a hazing incident that happened at Prestonsburg High School's
                        football camp earlier this month, which resulted in three players being suspended for two games and one player being kicked off the team. .A motorcycle-car collision,, at Harold, on Saturday night, claimed the life of a Pikeville
                        woman and serously injured her husband. According to a state police report, Ronnita Adams, 41, of North Mayo Trail, was killed, when the 1993 Harley Davidson motorcycle she was riding was struck by a 1983 Ford Fairmount driven
                        by Delmar E. Hamilton, 24, of Teaberry. The victim's husband, Robert, 40, who was operating the motorcycle, suffered neck injuries and a broken leg. Floyd County School Board members voted, Monday, to pay $409,400, for a site for
                        a Betsy Layne Middle School, which includes other undisclosed expenses. Robert Tackett, 44, of Burdine, is facing nine felony charges in connection with an assault of ambulance personnel and the theft of an ambulance, responding
                        to the scene of a car accident. Allen Taylor, Wheelwright City Commissioner, who has been accused by fellow board members of allegedly selling a city lawnmower, apparently turned over the proceeds of that sale to the city in February.
                        A Floyd County Grand Jury returned a murder indictment Monday, against Jackie Ray, 45, for allegedly shooting his brother, Allan Tommy Ray, 41, of Lexington, during an argument at Jackie Ray's home last month. Paul Joseph, who
                        operates ambulance services in Floyd, Johnson, Magoffin, Wolfe and Knott counties, has been named in a 299-count federal indictment alleging a scheme to defraud Medicaid of thousands of dollars, and mail fraud. Floyd County students
                        went back to school, Monday. School officials reported that the opening day of classes was relatively calm and no major problems were reported. John Calhoun Wells, formerly of Auxier, has been appointed by President Bill Clinton
                        as Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and as such, will sit at the head of a bargaining table and help major league baseball players and owners try to reach an agreement that would put the players back
                        on the field and fans back in the stands. Jurors are expected to render a verdict today, (Friday), in the murder trial of Larry Robinson, who is accused of killing William Bucky Rose on Memorial Day, 1993. Police say a Daniels
                        Creek man said he thought he was shooting at a dog, Saturday evening, when he fired two blasts from a shotgun, hitting a man riding a four-wheeler past his home. Kentucky State Police forced their way into the home of Malcolm Lewis,
                        74, Saturday night, and arrested him, after he allegedly shot Charles Jervis, also of Daniels Creek. A family reunion at Archer Park, Saturday, turned into an adventure that one Lexington family won't soon forget after their three-year-old
                        toddler tumbled into a creek. The toddler fell into the creek when he attempted to climb into the back of his grandfather's truck, which was parked close to a creek bank at the park..Fifth District Congressman Hal Rogers will dig
                        in during groundbreaking ceremonies in Prestonsburg for the Mountain Arts Center on Monday, August 29. Rogers will join local officials Jerry Fannin, Prestonsburg mayor; John M. Stumbo, Floyd County judge-executive; and Paul Hughes,
                        chairman of the Kentucky Opry Board for the ceremony. Jenny Wiley Summer Music Theatre and the Prestonsburg Tourism Commission has received funds disbursed by the state Depatment of Travel Development to the Eastern Highlands-North
                        Tourism Region through a matching grant program. The doors to the D.W. Howard Fieldhouse were locked, Wednesday, pending an inspection by state officials for asbestos in broken wall panels. There died: Ova Johnson, 73, of Bevinsville,
                        Thursday, August 18, at his residence; Liza Hall, 88, of Bevinsville, formerly of Dana, Saturday, August 20, at McDowell Appalachian Regional Hospital; Alice Mosley Kendrick, 92, of Huntington, West Virginia, Saturday, August 20,
                        at St. Mary's Hospital; Terry Mullins, 44, of Norwalk, Ohio, Saturday, August 20, at his home; James A. Cole, 80, of Parkersburg, West Virginia, formerly of Printer, Thursday, August 18; Girdell Dingus Salyers Breeding, 90, of

                    <p>Kevin Wade Parsons, 21-year-old native of Harold, died August 15, ending a six-year battle with Laforda Body Disease, an affliction so rare, that fewer than a dozen cases have been diagnosed worldwide. Three Wheelwright City Commissioners
                        want to oust a fellow board member for selling a piece of city property, allegedly without the approval of the board. At Monday's commission meeting, Commissioner Allen Taylor was accused by Commissioners Luther Johnson Jr., Charles
                        Harmon and David Hall, of selling a city lawnmower to an individual for $35. While the Pike County Fiscal Court was authorizing its county attorney, Monday night, to take any action necessary to collect a $216,000 delinquent account
                        owed by the Floyd County Solid Waste system, Floyd County Solid Waste Commissioners at their meeting were disputing the bill. A ruling earlier this year by the state Supreme Court resulted in an order from the state Public Service
                        Commission which will require municipal utility companies that provide services, mainly water, to seek commission approval for proposed rate increases. The commission's order includes the Prestonsburg City Utilities, but it will
                        have no immediate impact on the utility company. The state Supreme Court will be asked to decide if a hearing to determine if accused murderer, Clawvern Jacobs, is competent to aide in his defense should exclude the prosecution
                        and the public. A Pike County man was arrested in Floyd County, August 11, during an investigation into an alleged truck tire theft operation. Christopher Hodges, 22, was lodged in the Floyd County Jail and charged with third-degree
                        burglary and theft by unlawful taking. Next Monday, August 22, they'll ring in the start of a new school yer for nearly 8,300 Floyd County students, and they'll signal the final countdown on a critical phase of education reform
                        in Kentucky. One of the final pieces of the funding puzzle for the development, in Prestonsburg, of a Mountain Arts Center was put in place, Thursday, by Congressman Hal Rogers. Rogers said, Thursday, that a second $1 million grant
                        from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has been approved by the House of Representatives, with concurrence expected soon from the Senate. McDowell senior cittizens will host dedication and open house ceremonies at their
                        new senior citizens center, located in the Viola Bailey Memorial Community Building, Sunday, August 21, from 2-6 p.m. U.S. Senator Wendell Ford announced, Thursday, that the Appalachian Regional Commission has approved $98,000
                        in Section 207 funds to assist in the construction of 15 multi-family housing units for low-income families in Floyd County. A leading education enrichment organization has targeted Floyd County as a place to establish one of its
                        affiliates. Forward in the Fifth Inc., was awarded a $50,000 Appalachian Regional Commission grant to organize three local affiliates, and the agency hopes that one of those offices can be established in this county. The search
                        is underway for a new executive director for the Floyd County Development Authority, and for a candidate to fill a vacancy on the board. A missing persons report was filed this week with the KSP for George Dee Howell, 61, more
                        than two months after Howell told his sister Nancy Slone, that he was "going to Paintsville." Family members offered no explanation for the long delay in reporting Howell's disappearance, but indicated he may have been seen as
                        recently as three weeks ago in the Pikeville area. The situation has been likened to martial law, but security guards hired to keep an eye on things at Left Beaver Townhouses are a temporary measure designed to thwart suspected
                        drug activity in the housing project. State police are investigating the cause of a fire at Wheelwright, Wednesday evening, that claimed the life of Glen Randall Johnson. Johnson's home on the Left Fork of Otter Creek caught fire
                        at approximately 7:30 p.m. and members of the Southeast Volunteer Fire Department responded to the scene. A survey will be conducted during the next several months that will assess the literacy level of Kentucky's adults. There
                        died: Shirlene Branham Slone, 73, of Pinellas Park, Florida, formerly of Prestonsburg, Wednesday, August 10, at the Sunshine Village Nursing Home, in Pinellas Park; Margarett Slone, 92, of Dema, Thursday, August 11, at the home
                        of her daughter, Clotine Hicks in Payne, Ohio; Judy Hall, 73, of Lackey, Friday, August 12, at Hazard Appalachian Regional Medical Center; Marcus D. Slone, 66, of Garner, Monday, August 15, at Hazard Appalachian Regional Hospital;

                    <p>A special judge has given the attorney for a Floyd County man until Friday to complete the taking of evidence in a civil suit that accuses Judge-Executive John M. Stumbo of election fraud during the May 1993 primary election campaign.
                        But attorney C.K. Belhasen, who represents radio station owner Dale McKinney in the suit against Stumbo, said he had not been officially served with the judge's order on Monday. A former Adams Middle School principal's suit against
                        the Floyd County Board of Education will go to trial Thursday, more than two years after the orginal complaint was filed. About 25 craftspeople from Floyd County, and other counties in the region, gathered at the lodge at Jenny
                        Wiley State Park, last Wednesday, to learn the ends and outs of marketing their crafts. The day-long workshop was sponsored by the Kentucky Arts and Crafts Foundation in Louisville. Allen City Hall became a verbal battleground
                        Monday night, during the city's council meeting, but that didn't stop the council from giving themselves raises, or naming a city manager. Discussion became heated about halfway through the meeting when city councilwoman Anne Bentley
                        began casting aspersions on the ability of police chief Virgil Conn, to carry out his duties. The Prestonsburg City Council's personnel committee will be going back to the drawing board to find the best way to comparing "apples
                        to apples." The council is trying to finalize the pay rates, work schedules and raises for city employees for the current fiscal year, with dispatch, fire and police departments still to be worked out. Several coal trucks lined
                        up at Garth, last week, as Rumpke of Kentucky cleaned out the temporary land fill. The waste was transported to Cooksey Brothers Land Fill in Greenup County. Martin City Council is continuing its efforts to clear up the city's
                        water problems, and is considering assistance from the Water Resources Assistance Corporation (WRAC), a division of the Big Sandy Area Development District. It is also considering raising the city's water rates. Prestonsburg Mayor
                        Jerry Fannin handed acting Police Chief Darrell Conley the keys, Wednesday, to one of the six new police cars the city purchased for the police department. A countywide crusade to raise donations for Terri LaShae Jarvis, of Allen,
                        a Floyd County infant, in need of two life-saving transplants will get underway today. Crusade volunteers were manning roadblocks at strategic locations in Prestonsburg, Martin, Allen, Mud Creek and Garrett, and asking for donations
                        for expenses needed for transporting the infant and mother to a Pittsburgh hospital for a donor match and to cover other expenses. Members of the Jenny Wiley Festival Committee, the Prestonsburg tourism director, and the press,
                        waited for almost an hour wednesday morning, for a meeting of the Prestonsburg Tourism Commission to get underway. Preliminary hearings were held in Floyd District Court, Wednesday afternoon, and included a hearing for a Floyd
                        man who escaped from custody earlier this month. Rodney Blackburn had been brought downstairs from the Floyd County jail to District Court for arraignment on August 2, along with 12 other prisoners and fled when the group was filing
                        into the courtroom. Testimony concluded Thursday afternoon in a day-long civil trial involving a dispute between a former Adams Middle School principal and the Floyd County Board of Education. It could take a month, though, before
                        a verdict is issued in the case. At issue is a complaint filed by former AMS principal Thomas Tackett, who was demoted in 1992 by interim, state-appointed superintendent Eldon Smith to the job of housebound instructor. The Army
                        Corps of Engineers will soon be looking at the ups and downs of flood control along the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River. Funding for a study of the Levisa Fork Basin in Floyd, Pike and Johnson counties was included in the 1995
                        Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, passed by the House of Representatives this week. There died: Tina Lafferty Crum, 84, of Prestonsburg, Thursday, August 4, at Riverview Manor Nursing Home; Oma Whittaker, 84, of

                    <p><strong>(July 27 and July 29, 1994)&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p>Timothy R. Prater, 32, of Middle Creek, died at about 5:20 p.m., Monday, when the mine car he was riding collided with another car at Pontiki Coal Corporation No. 1-A mine at Lovely. With less than a week to go, no one has filed with
                        the county court clerk's office for three seats on Floyd County's school board, which will be on the ballot in November. The state budget, recently passed by a special session of the legislature, included new funding for the Rural
                        Secondary Road program, and that means blacktop patching for eight Floyd county roadways. The Prestonsburg City Council took a step toward future annexation, Monday night, with the first reading of an ordinance that could allow
                        the city to incorporate areas without any objection. The results of a four-month evaluation of Floyd County Superintendent Steve Towler are expected to be made public at the August 1 school board meeting. School board members met
                        Monday night at May Lodge for more than two hours in closed session, to complete their assessment of Towler's job performance. An on-again, off-again debate has been renewed concerning leased property adjacent to the old Floyd
                        County landfill site at Garth, where county officials aren't sure if an extended lease agreement is valid. The Prestonsburg City Council voted, Monday, to allow Mayor Jerry Fannin to appoint a board to look at building an 18-hole
                        golf course and athletic complex at Mayo Hollow. Fannin said that having a board would allow Prestonsburg to work with the state in efforts to build the "world class" course. U.S. Rep. Harold "Hal" Rogers announced, Tuesday, that
                        the Appalachian Region Commission (ARC) has approved a $50,000 grant for Forward in the Fifth, the education improvement project started by Rogers and community leaders seven years ago. Forward in the Fifth serves more than 40
                        counties in southern and eastern Kentucky. For the second time in eight years, the Floyd County Clerk's office has received a local records grant to help with the restoration of records. Floyd County Clerk Carla R. Boyd was awarded
                        the grant recently from the Department for Libraries and Archives, an agency of the Education, Arts and Humanities Cabinet. A joint effort is underway between the Floyd County Development Authority and Kentucky Power Company to
                        construct a 21,000 square foot building at Cliff. The building will be used to entice new business into the county. The site is owned by the Prestonsburg Industrial Development Corporation. Jimmy Branham raced in the Open Wheel
                        Modified, last Saturday night, at Thunder Ridge. He is the youngest driver to take part in a race at Thunder Ridge at the age of 14 years. Martin City Council has been trying for the past several months to figure on a way to get
                        a handle on the finances of the city water department and, also, to hire a city attorney. U.S. Representative Hal Rogers has recently urged federal transportation officials to support the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet's $975,000
                        request for preliminary work for the Kentucky segment of I-66. The case of a Toler Creek man charged with murder in the July 17 shooting death of his brother has been waived to the Floyd County Grand Jury. At a preliminary hearing
                        Wednesday in Floyd District Court, Judge Danny Caudill ruled that enough evidence was presented to establish probable cause that Jackie M. Ray, 45, was responsible for the death of his brother, Allan Tommy Ray, 41, of Lexington.
                        .With four days to go until the filing deadline, two current school board members and a Wayland City Councilman have filed to retain their seats in November. A special meeting of the Prestonsburg-Floyd County Public Properties
                        Corporation has been called for Tuesday, August 2, at 3 p.m. On the agenda for the meeting is an update on design of the Mountain Arts Center with discussion on the design of the facility..The folks at Riverview Manor Nursing Home
                        know Tommy Franklin is a hero. On August 13, the folks living in the tri-state area of Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio will also know that Franklin is a hero when WSAZ airs its Hometown Hero segment. Franklin's volunteer work

                    representing Triple B Corporation, which won a civil lawsuit against the school board last year, told Floyd County school board members, Thursday, that the report written by Gary Griesser, associate commissioner for district support
                    services, was �short on brains and long on title.� Griesser was asked by state Education Commissioner Thomas Boysen to prepare a chronological report of the problem-plagued South Floyd High School project which has been active since
                    1986. Griesser released his report last month to members of the State Board for Elementary and Secondary Education. Griesser�s report blamed much of the problems and delays on the South Floyd project on Triple B, former architect James

                    Berkhimer, 47, was accused last year of touching a 15-year-old female student in a sexual way, and of filing a false employment application. Berkhimer, former principal at Wheelwright High School, was suspended from his post after
                    the student accused him on two different occasions of improperly touching her. He was later rehired as principal by former superintendent Ron Hager, but was fired by interim superintendent Eldon Smith, when Hager was ousted by the

                    commissioner Nate Sholer prior to Wednesday�s commission meeting at Churchill Downs in Louisville. Sholer suggested that the commission might be persusaded to hold its Final Fairgrounds race meet at Kentucky Downs, thus making the

                    election�s outcome, Floyd County Clerk Carla �Robinson� Boyd said this week. The recanvass was requested in May by out-going Commonwealth�s Attorney Jerry Patton; county judge/executive candidate Dale McKinney and jailer candidate

                    <p>(May 26 and May 28, 1993)</p>Incumbent Floyd County Sheriff Paul Hunt Thompson, came cleanly away from what was easily the muddiest campaign of the primary season to lead all vote-getters, Tuesday. Although former deputy sheriff John

                    John M. Stumbo turned back a spirited challenge, Tuesday, from one well-known radio personality to earn a chance against another this fall. Surprisingly close, as early returns filtered in, Tuesday, Stumbo�s margin over Republican-turned-Democrat
                    Dale McKinney, widened as the night drew on. McKinney, owner-operator of Martin radio station WMDJ, made an issue of the county�s solid waste problems during his campaign, and that issue obviously helped McKinney carry 12 of the county�s
                    41 precincts. Unofficial totals gave Stumbo the win, however, with a 8,994 vote total to McKinney�s 7,011 votes. Stumbo will now face Republican nominee Gorman Collins Sr., in the November election. Collins is owner of Prestonsburg
                    station WQHY, and is currently a member of the Prestonsburg City Council...Eula Hall, founder of the Mud Creek Clinic, received yet another honor, Sunday afternoon, when she was awarded an honorary Ph.D. by the president of Hartford,

                    nursing home. The plan was first announced, last week, when Floyd County Development Authority Executive Director Darrell Gilliam told members of that agency that an informal consortium, including members of the governmental bodies
                    of Prestonsburg and Paintsville, and Floyd, Martin and Lawrence counties, had suggested submitting an application to the federal government ,offering property adjacent to the airport for the facility. One problem with the plan, Big
                    Sandy Area Development District Director Roger Recktenwald told members of the board, last week, is that the VA nursing home facility might not be compatible with the airport strip...Problems at the polls plagued the political process
                    in Floyd County, Tuesday, preventing some early morning pollsters from casting their ballots and giving the state Board of Elections pause for thought. The problems started early, Floyd County Clerk Carla �Robinson� Boyd said, when

                    electing dark horse challenger John Earl Hunt by a slender margin, in what may have been the primary�s greatest upset. In unofficial totals of the 17,030 ballots cast in Tuesday�s election, representing more than 56 percent of registered
                    voters in the county, Hunt defeated Patton by a 539-vote margin, receiving 8,383 votes to Patton�s 7,894...Bingo is back at Prestonsburg High School, and the first numbers are expected to be called at the weekly game�s revival on Monday,

                    that compelled out-going Commonwealth�s Attorney, Jerry Patton, to request that seven ballot machines be impounded immediately after the election, Tuesday, Floyd County Clerk Carla Boyd said, Thursday, that none of the losing candidates
                    have as yet asked for a vote recanvass. Boyd said that she, Patton and Attorney General Chris Gorman, had asked the Pikeville Post of the Kentucky State Police to impound the machines after mechanical malfunctions at the Wheelwright,
                    Maytown and Cliff Number Two precincts, forced voters to cast paper ballots, and the locks on machines at the Auxier, Abbott Creek, Porter and Garrett precincts had apparently been tampered with...President Bill Clinton�s controversial
                    new energy tax plan may spell trouble for Eastern Kentucky, Fifth Congressional District Representaitve Harold Rogers said Wednesday, costing the region nearly 2,000 jobs. Rogers said in a press release issued Wednesday, that Clinton�s
                    energy plan, which went before the House of representatives Thursday, contains the �largest tax increase in America�s history� and will have a dramatic impact on rural America, particularly Eastern Kentucky...A Floyd County man was
                    allegedly held at gunpoint, Wednesday, by a Prestonsburg woman who demanded the man take her to the First Guaranty National Bank and withdraw funds from an account. The man, Mike Taylor, told police that a woman, identified as Rhonda
                    Harris, also known as Rhonda Vanco, came to his business place, Thursday, claiming that her car had a flat tire, and that she was pregnant and needed assistance. Floyd County deputy Ricky Thornsberry said the victim said the woman
                    pulled out what appeared to be a .45 caliber weapon and said she was wired with explosives. Taylor reported that the woman instructed him to drive to the bank at Martin. When Taylor pulled into the parking lot at the bank, he fled
                    the vehicle and phoned the sheriff�s department. The woman was later taken into custody...A site preparation contract was awarded, Wednesday, to Ooten Coal Company, for work to begin on the physical education facility at South Floyd

                    at Barren River State Park. The report, delivered by Gary Griessler, associate commissioner for district support services, offered eight recommendations which arose from a chronological review of the controversial south Floyd High
                    School project in Floyd County...Due process hearings scheduled in Monday for four Floyd County school administrators whose jobs were eliminated under a reorganization, were canceled on the advice of the board�s attorney. Board Attorney
                    Cliff Latta recommended, on Monday, that the hearings be canceled, because, in his opinion, the administrators didn�t comply with a provision of state law regarding demotion hearings...The Floyd County Board of Education has until
                    September to convince the state Department of Education that adequate progress is being made to implement department-mandated short and long-range goals, Education Commissioner Thomas Boysen said Tuesday. Addressing the state board
                    for Elementary and secondary education at Barren River State Park-near Glasgow, Boysen suggested that some leeway would be granted a nearly all-new Floyd County board, but he added that progress on the educational improvement plan
                    is a must...Pilot error was the probable cause of a plane crash last Thursday evening that left two men critically burned and injured, officials say. Miraculously however, Terry D. Hall and Larry K. Williamson survived when the single-engine
                    aircraft slammed into a mountainside and burst into flames, moments after taking off from Bert Combs Field...Just one week before the one-year anniversary of the date a young Swiss traveler disappeared, a Floyd County man, who is wanted
                    for questioning in the disappearance, was arrested by Kentucky State Police Friday in Laurel County. Harry Eugene Hale, 46, of Martin, is being held at the Laurel County jail on a bail jumping charge from Carrollton, Georgia. Hale
                    was arrested in Georgia, last year, on a theft charge involving the use of a credit card belonging to Chris Zahn from Bolligen, Switzerland, who has been missing from Deltona, Florida, since May 21, 1992...A Perry County woman was
                    killed and a Floyd County couple were seriously injured in two separate accidents Wednesday, less than an hour and a mile apart on new US 23. At 11:45 a.m., Wednesday, Elaine S. Adkins, 63, of Hazard, was killed when she apparently
                    drove her vehicle into the path of a truck driven by Stephen Salyer, 23, of Stambaugh, a state police report said. Less than an hour, Charles and Grace Woody of Prestonsburg, were traveling south on new US 23, when their vehicle was
                    apparently struck by a van, driven by Kathy Lowe of Prestonsburg. Charles Woody, 73, received lacerations to his head and arms. Grace Woody, 65, received a severe laceration to her head. The couple is in stable condition...A Wheelwright
                    City Commissioner said Thursday that comments made at Tuesday�s commission meeting concerning the lack of local jobs for the construction of a new prison were the result of a misunderstanding...The long-standing battle over the ultimate
                    fate of the Bert T. Combs Airport may soon come to a close, as an informal city-county affiliation proceeds with plans to offer the property to the federal government as a possible site for a proposed Veteran�s Administration nursing
                    home. The heated debate over the airport�s impending demise began early last year�when the cities of Prestonsburg and Paintsville proposed closing the facility for use as an industrial site. Others contested that the airport was far
                    too valuable to the Big Sandy region�s economy to shut down, just because the site had development-potential. The matter remains unresolved pending further investigation by an advisory panel created by the two cities...Combining �60s
                    activism with good old fashioned Eastern Kentucky pride, a small group of concerned citizens converged on Governor Brereton Jones� Frankfort offices, Thursday, in an attempt to air their grievances with the Kentucky Racing Commission.
                    The protest group, organized last week after the racing commission apparently reneged on its original commitment to Eastern Kentucky Racing Incorporated, by refusing to allow the group to operate the proposed Kentucky Downs Harness
                    Track with temporary facilities. State school officials have disputed a claim that local school board member, Eddie Billips, is responsible for delaying phase III of the South Floyd High construction project..There died: Clinton �Charlie�

                    <p>(May 12 and May 14, 1993)</p>An architect is blaming a Floyd County School Board member for delays on a controversial school construction project which apparently was never approved by the board of education in the first place. At
                    Monday�s board of education meeting, South Floyd gym architect, Paul Hoffman, claimed that state education officials �mysteriously� put a hold on the gym project at South Floyd because board member Eddie Billips �had a meeting in Frankfort�
                    last month. Billips had raised questions about the cost of moving the gym site from its original location, and whether approval to move the gym by a �consensus� of the board was proper...A discussion on the upcoming Festival of F.A.C.E.S.,
                    and a disagreement over the uncertain fate of the Bert T. Combs airport turned faces red, Monday evening, at a meeting of the Prestonsburg City Council. Debate over the Festival of F.A.C.E.S. began Monday, when Prestonsburg Tourism
                    Commission director Fred James said that much of this year�s festival would be confined to the Prestonsburg Municipal Parking Lot, rather than having it spread out over the downtown area, as in past years....Residents of Auxier are
                    ready to take matters into their own hands to prevent the planned closure of their elementary school by the Floyd County Board of Education. After offering their emotional pleas at Monday�s special school board meeting, to keep the
                    school open, several residents announced, afterward, that they are planning to incorporate their town and establish an independent school system...Eastern Kentucky law-enforcement agencies could soon be escalating the war against drugs,
                    with the formation of the proposed Mountain Area Drug Task Force, a joint effort between the cities of Prestonsburg and Hazard, along with Floyd, Perry, Letcher, Knott, Magoffin and Pike counties, to end drug trafficking and abuse
                    in the entire region. Prestonsburg Police Chief Greg Hall told members of the Prestonsburg City Council, Monday evening, that the Mountain Area Drug Task Force would utilize personnel and resources from each of the participating law-enforcement
                    agencies, to form a multijurisdictional unit that would greatly enhance each agency�s drug enforcement efforts...Monday�s two appointments to the Floyd County Board of Education, by Education Commissioner Thomas Boysen, marked the
                    first time, since January, that a full board has been complemented. Robert Isaac and Brent Clark were officially named, Monday morning, to fill board seats in educational districts two and three respectively, and took the oath of office
                    at a special board meeting, Monday evening...A single-engine airplane crashed, Thursday evening, at Block House Bottom, across from Combs Airport and injured at least two men. Two unidentified male victims were removed from the scene
                    and taken to new highway U.S. 23 to be transported into waiting helicopters. One victim reportedly fell 50 feet from the crash site down onto a set of railroad tracks. The other victim was reportedly trapped between the airplane wreckage
                    and a tree. Both men reportedly received burns on their hands, arms, and faces...Second degree wanton endangerment charges against a Martin City Councilman were dismissed last month, when the prosecuting witness failed to show up in
                    court. Two charges against councilman Jeff Jones were dismissed, April 28, by Floyd District Judge Danny Caudill. Court records show that the complaining witnesses, James Meade and Margaret Woods, did not appear in court that day...An
                    attorney representing three Floyd County administrators, whose jobs were eliminated under a district reorganization plan, claims the local school board violated the state�s Open Meetings Laws and statutory requirements for conducting
                    due process hearings for employees affected by the plan. In a May 12 letter to acting board chairman Eddie Patton, attorney E. Mickey McGuire, contends that the board�s discussion of the reorganization plan in a closed session at the
                    March 30 and April 3 meetings, was in violation of the law...Floyd County school superintendent Steve Towler is apparently one of five finalists in the superintendent search for the Russell Independent School System, in Greenup County.
                    Towler, who signed a four-year contract to direct the Floyd County system last July, will be interviewed today (Friday) by the Russell search committee...There died: Beatrice Miller Rogers, 80, of West Prestonsburg, Monday, at Highlands

                    investigation �politically motivated.� On Friday, Floyd County Solid Waste was issued a notice of violation by the Cabinet for Natural Resources and Environmental Protection for dumping waste on a concrete pad at a non-operational
                    coal company, then transferring the waste to larger trucks...An item on the agenda for a special Floyd County Fiscal Court meeting, today, Wednesday, appears to be in conflict with state law. The court has proposed action on a resolution
                    to set salaries for elected officials whose terms will begin next January, but any decision on that matter could be illegal. State law requires the fiscal court to determine salaries for elected officials �not later than the first
                    Monday in May, in the year in which the officers are elected.�...School construction regulations issued by the state, March 24, to contractors and architects, are not entirely new, an official said, Tuesday, but they apparently came
                    as a surprise to local school officials. Meanwhile, other long-standing construction regulations have apparently been overlooked in relation to local school building projects. Gary Griesser, associate commissioner for district support
                    services for the Department of Education, said Tuesday, that the March 24 list of construction requirements was issued �as a reminder and a preview of things to come.� He said several of the items outlined in the memo to contractors
                    had not yet been adopted as official regulations, but they were expected to be, and he urged contractors and architects to follow them....The race may be over, but it will be a few more days before the results of the photo-finish are
                    released, indicating whether or not Eastern Kentucky Racing Incorporated, and the Prestonsburg-Floyd County Properties Corporation, will trot to the winner�s circle in the marathon effort to bring live horse racing to eastern Kentucky.
                    Floyd County Attorney Jim Hammond told members of the Properties Corporation, Tuesday, that former Governor Julian Carroll, representing Eastern Kentucky Racing, had been granted a special meeting on May 12, with the Kentucky Racing

                    to locate and eradicate marijuana patches paid off, Thursday, when law enforcement officers destroyed, 118 plants. Kentucky State Police and Floyd County Sheriff�s deputies received an anonymous tip that led to the discovery of the
                    patch, high on a hillside at Weeksbury...Education Commissioner Thomas Boysen missed his second self-imposed deadline, Thursday, to name two Floyd Countians to fill vacancies on the local school board. Education department spokesman
                    Steve Swift said, Thursday, that Commissioner Boysen may announce the appointments next week. �The information has been sent to the commissioner, and we�re just awaiting his decision,� Swift said Thursday. �I don�t know if there is
                    a deadline. They were hoping to get it done by the end of the month, and they didn�t get it done then. Now what we�re doing is trying to get the decision as soon as possible...Two days past the legal deadline, Floyd County Fiscal Court
                    members, on Wednesday, set salaries for elected county officials who will serve five-year terms beginning January 1994. The court apparently will not be penalized for the violation, because there were no adverse effects to the public
                    as a result of the two-day delay...There died: Elex P. Davis, 88, of Banner, formerly of Betsy Layne, Monday, at Good Samaritan Hospital in Lexington; Foley Hicks, 75, of Garrett, Wednesday, at Our Lady of the Way Hospital; Robert

                    Hoffman at the controversial school site, Saturday morning, for an explanation of why the architect wants to locate the gym in a different area. Hoffman said that the 1,700 seat gym would not fit on the original gym site. He added

                    purse strings while school officials struggle to finish construction in time for an August opening. The latest adventure in financing for the new school arose, last week, after officials learned they would likely be short of funding

                    apparently renewed its on-again/off-again opposition to the much-beleaguered Kentucky Downs harness track project. Former Governor Julian Carroll, representing Eastern Kentucky Racing, last week asked the commission to curtail discussion
                    on the Hazard OTB parlor, proposed by Kentucky Off-Track Betting, reasoning that such a facility, located within 75 miles of Kentucky Downs, would violate Kentucky state law, and the terms of Eastern Kentucky Racing�s license...A mid-afternoon

                    when, legally, he never held that position.� Boyd, who suffered a stroke, last October, and who has remained in a wheelchair and unable to speak, was sworn into office in a private ceremony in January. Dan Hall, acting as legal guardian
                    for Boyd, resigned Boyd from his board seat March 31, because of health reasons. Boyd�s resignation came just days before he was scheduled to answer charges of misconduct in office, before the State Board for Elementary and Secondary

                    Magoffin, Letcher, Knott, Perry, Leslie and Lawrence counties, a company spokesman said, Thursday. Equitable Gas Company, a division of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Equitable Resources, Incorporated, works in conjunction with the
                    Kentucky-West Virginia Gas Company to provide natural gas to an estimated 1,600 Floyd County customers, Equitable Resources Communications Director Brian Plant said, Thursday. He added that Kentucky-West Virginia Gas customers should
                    not be affected by the price hike, if it is allowed...The signs may have been taken down repeatedly, but the message remains the same�why? Why have the accidents at the new U.S. 23 and Route 1428 continued, killing two people and critically
                    injuring four others. Even more importantly, one Floyd County man asks, why hasn�t the state taken the necesssary measures to stop what he terms the �senseless slaughter.� The man, who prefers to be known only as �Anonymous,� continues
                    to place the signs proclaiming �Why?� on the rock cliff that provided an untimely end for Jimmy Howard Brewer, 34, of Seagrove, North Carolina, and 15-month-old Katherine Baker, of Clintwood, Virginia...A Wheelwright man who threatened
                    to kill acting Wheelwright Police Chief Bob Moore during a Wheelwright city commission meeting last month, did so, because he was under the influence of a drug called Prozac, his attorney said Wednesday. Prestonsburg attorney Ned Pillersdorf
                    appeared in Floyd County District Court, Wednesday, for a preliminary hearing on behalf of his client, Rodney Thornsberry. Pillersdorf waived the hearing and District Judge Danny Caudill sent the matter to circuit court where a grand
                    jury is expected to hear evidence in the case later this month. Pillersdorf said if Thornsberry is indicted for wanton endangerment and first degree assault on a police officer with a weapon, and the case goes to court, he will blame
                    his client�s actions on his taking the drug Prozac, a drug commonly prescribed to treat depression...There died: Herby Messer, 70, of Leburn, Sunday, at the Hazard Appalachian Regional Medical Center; Dora Martin Blackburn, 74, of

                    Floyd County�s own Commonwealth Attorney, Jerry Patton. Last week, Patton removed his bid for re-election to the office of Commonwealth Attorney, a position which he has held since 1988, citing a desire to devote more time to his private
                    legal practice and to his five-year-old son. On Monday, however, Patton announced, in a press release, that he had re-entered the race so that he could continue serving people of the Commonwealth. He said that his original decision
                    to pull out of the race was based primarily on the fact that he was concerned about the strain that a campaign would put on his parents, since his father had earlier experienced heart problems and underwent coronary bypass surgery...A
                    Floyd County couple died, Wednesday afternoon, after their automobile collided with a coal truck on Route 114 at Middle Creek. According to a report filed, Wednesday, by the Pikeville Post of the Kentucky State Police, Eula Mae Huppert,

                    and struck the Huppert vehicle. Both vehicles careened into the east-bound lane and struck a guard rail. Sturgill�s truck went over the hill, knocking over a utility pole. Huppert�s passenger, her husband, John W. Huppert, 65, was
                    pronounced dead at the scene by Floyd County Coroner Roger E. Nelson...Despite earlier reports and a United States Department of Agriculture spokesman�s insistence to the contrary, last week, the Floyd County Agriculture Stabilization
                    and Conservation Services may still fall under the knife in a massive budget cut. The proposed cut is part of a major down-sizing effort, intended to update and streamline the Department of Agriculture�s operations. The current USDA

                    is on in Kentucky schools, where the stakes are high for those unable to keep up the pace. Test scores released Wednesday, by the State Department of Education, will serve as the baseline for improving education in Kentucky, and they
                    suggest some schools will have to travel a wider circuit if they are to meet state goals. The formula for measuring success is fairly simple, schools are expected to attain test scores of 100 points, over a period of 20 years. Scores
                    from 1992 testing serve as the starting point, and the difference between that number and the goal of 100 points, must be made up in ten percent increments every two years...A Floyd County jury found a Johnson County man guilty, Thursday,

                    education officials are proceeding with hearings for two Floyd County School Board members to determine if the pair should be ousted from office. Thursday�s agenda for the State Board for Elementary and Secondary Education includes
                    a proposal to schedule a hearing for Floyd County Board vice-chairman Tommy Boyd, who has been accused of misconduct in office. Boyd was accused by Education Commissioner Thomas Boysen, in October, of interfering in the hiring of a
                    employee for the Betsy Layne High School Youth Service Center. State School Board members will also conduct a summary hearing concerning allegations of misconduct levied, January 5, against Floyd County Board Chairman Ray �Shag� Campbell,
                    accused of signing architect and construction manager contracts for the 21-classroom addition at Betsy Layne Elementary, in October 1991, without board approval...A 27-year-old Magoffin County man pleaded guilty to charges of first
                    degree robbery Saturday afternoon, two days before his trial was scheduled to start. John Fletcher of Marshallville had pleaded guilty, last year, to the robbery charge, but failed to adhere to part of the agreement, and his trial
                    was reset to begin Monday. Commonwealth Attorney Jerry Patton said Monday. Patton recommended a 12 and one-half year prison sentence on the robbery charge. Formal sentencing has not been set...State School Board Members voted, Thursday,
                    to hold a second hearing, next month, for Floyd County School Board Chairman Ray �Shag� Campbell to determine if misconduct charges levied against him warrant his removal from office. At a summary hearing, Thursday, in Frankfort, state
                    board members listened to evidence in Campbell�s case and voted to hold a second hearing on the charges, February 22, at 9 a.m. The second hearing was scheduled in order for the state board to �get greater depth and detail of evidence

                    and sexual abuse of a nine-year-old girl. During jury selection Wednesday, public defender David L. Williams sought to delay the trial, complaining that he was only recently assigned to the case and was not allowed enough time to prepare
                    an adequate deffense. Williams also told prospective jurors that his client could prove that he had been out of the state on the day of the rape; that Patton�s civil rights had been violated, because no counsel was present when he
                    was questioned by police; and that Patton had been confused, because he had only a first-grade education, was illiterate, and had a possible history of mental and behavioral problems...In response to state education department scrutiny,
                    Floyd County School Board members called for a thorough review of contracts for ongoing school construction projects at Tuesday�s board meeting. The board also voted to delete a highly controversial open-ended clause in the construction
                    manager�s contract for the Betsy Layne classroom addition in October 1991. The clause in the contract allows for monthly payments to continue to the contractor even if the project is delayed �through no fault� of the construction manager.
                    Removal of the �open-end� provision in the construction manager�s contract appears irrelevant at this point, however, since the validity of the entire agreement remains in question...There died: Samuel R. �Buddy� Hatcher, 83, of Allen,

                    had tried to influence the hiring of a school employee for the New Horizon Youth Service Center in Betsy Layne. Boyd was sworn in by Deloris Dingus, finance officer for the Floyd County Fiscal Court, at his home around 1 p.m., Friday.
