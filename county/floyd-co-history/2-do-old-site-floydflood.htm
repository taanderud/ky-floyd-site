		<td>Picture of girls taken at Wayland Floyd Co., Kentucky, to the left is a<br>building that was used long ago
			to store caskets, but at the time of this<br>flood in the 1940's it was used to store row boats to rescue
			flood victims. Floods came often to Beaver Creek area before the time of when the RR was built and at which
			time, the RR built flood walls. <br>The larger building in the back was the old movie house. My
			grandparents<br>as well as my mother lived at Wayland when this flood pic was taken, my<br>Mother recalls my
			grandmother telling her that her parents would have<br>to move alot of the furniture upstairs, and
			somethings were on top of <br>the dining room table when the floods would come.</td>
