  <h1>Early History Floyd County</h1>
  <p>Found on Floyd County Mailing List from Jim Hawes</p>
  <p>Jennie Wiley, wife of an outlying settler, Thomas Wiley, living on Walker's Creek, was captured by
    Indians and taken north over the Big Sandy war trail to the mouth of Little Sandy River, thence by a
    devious course in a southerly direction to Mud Lick near Big Paint Creek ten miles from Harman's
    Station. </p>
  <p>In the fall and winter of the year of 1787-1788, Mathias Harman, Henry Skaggs, James Skaggs and
    Robert Hawes (Haws) built the first blockhouse on the Big Sandy River about one-half mile below the
    mouth of Johns Creek in the bottom of the Levisa Fork of the River. Jennie Wiley escaped from Indians
    camped at Mud Lick and in the night found her way to Harman's Station and safety. </p>
  </p>Indians ran the Harman
  party off and burned the stockade in 1789. Harman's Station was rebuilt and occupied in the year 1790.
  Note: Most of the people mentioned here came from the Tazewell County area of Virginia. Robert
  Hawes (Haws) signed the petition to create Wythe County, VA from parent Montgomery County, VA in 1790.
