Slain Woman Under Sentence for Slaying Husband</B> <BR>Two of three Floyd 
County Slayers were still uncaptured Thursday after contributing to one of the 
most sanguinary weeks experienced by the county in some time. After escaping 
into the hills immediately following the slayings, they continued to evade 
arrest as The Times went to press. <BR>In the meantime a charge of willful 
murder had been filed by the grand jury here against <B>George Brown,</B> who 
beat<B> Henry Adams,</B> aged Floyd farmer, to death last Saturday. <BR>In 
addition to the three killings, two other attempts ae alleged to have been made 
at murder. Stories of the slayings appear below. <BR>Two days before she was to 
have been taken to the state reformatory at Frankfort to begin serving a 
five year sentence for the slaying of her husband , <B>John Smith </B>,<B> . Mrs 
Tina Johnson Smith</B>, 30 yrs old, was shot and killed by her father , 
<B>Daniel R. Johnson,</B> aged Floyd Co man, at the Johnson home on Abner Fork 
of Left Beaver Thursday morning of last week. <BR>Her aged father shot <B>Mrs. 
Smith </B>three times, It is claimed , while he lay in bed unable to move as a 
result of injuries sustained at her hands a few days earlier , and as she 
advanced upon him throwing stones threating him with an ax, . He had suffered 
three broken ribs at his daughter's hands and was unable to be moved here 
immediately after the shooting it is claimed. <BR>It was held probable this week 
that the grand jury would not make an indictment in the case. <BR><B>Mrs. 
Smith</B> killed her husband in January, 1931, and pleaded self-defense in 
circuit court here, claiming that he was trying to hang her, using his belt as a

TIMES DURING THE GULF WAR, ARTICLES PERTAIN TO WWII AND THE KOREAN 
WAR</U></B> <BR> 
<P><B>RELEASE OF JAPS' PRISONERS BRINGS JOY, HOPE TO 
COUNTY</B> <BR> Floyd County had its intimate 
share in the nationwide wave of <BR>thankfulness 
arising with the news that American prisoners had been <BR>liberated on Luzon. <BR> One 
Floyd soldier was released in the heroic commando raid by American 
<BR>Rangers and Filipino guerillas last week which freed 513 
American <BR>prisoners, survivors of the Bataan's 
"March of Death" after the fall of <BR>Corregidor, 
and a nurse, a sister of a Floyd county man, was liberated a <BR>few days later, from San Tomas internment camp in Manila as 
McArthur's <BR>forces dashed into the capital of the 
Phillipines. <BR> The soldier now among friends 
and freed Jap cruelty is Pvt. Lawrence <BR>Robinson, 
son of Robert Robinson, of Wayland, and a member of the famed <BR>31st Infantry whose survivors were taken from Corregidor on its 
fall as <BR>prisoners. The nurse is 
Lieut. Ruby Bradley, 37, Spencer, W.Va., sister of Smith <BR>Bradley, Prestonsburg, who was one of the 11 nurses taken prisoner 
on <BR>Bataan. <BR> 
Anxiously awaiting the day when word will come that their sons are 
<BR>released are Mr. &amp; Mrs. W.J. Reynolds, Martin, 
parents of J.B. (Bud) <BR>Reynolds, a medical 
corpsman on Corregidor at its fall, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. <BR>J.E. Walters, of Emma, parents of Seaman Wyman Walters, also 
taken <BR>prisoner on the Phillippines after his ship 
had been bombed. Letters <BR>received by these 
parents, however, indicate that their sons have been <BR>removed to the Japanese mainland. Another Wayland soldier, 
Fred <BR>Williams, was taken prisoner by the Japanese 
but died in April, 1942, <BR>his father J.W. 
Williams, was notified. <BR> Father of Pvt. 
Robinson, a miner at Wayland, <BR>could not be 
reached for an interview, but The Times was assisted by <BR>Noble Hobbs there in gaining an insight into his reaction to the 
news <BR>that his son was safe and at last in a 
American hands. <BR>Mr. Robinson was notified by the 
American Red Cross in a wire from <BR>Lexington that 
his son had been liberated. He was characteristically <BR>reticent. "I didn't work the next day," he quietly 
remarked. <BR> Lieut. Bradley, the nurse freed 
from internment in Manila, has visited <BR>her 
brother, an employee of the Columbian Fuel Corporation here, several 
<BR>times. An Army nurse since she was graduated from 
Walter Reed hospital, <BR>Washington, D.C., 19 years 
ago, she was sent to the Philippines in 1938 <BR>and 
was superintendent of nurses at Camp Hay hospital in Manila at the 
<BR>time she deliberately remained behind to care for the 
wounded as the <BR>Japs closed in on the city. 

<P><B>WIREMAN WINS HERO-AWARD IN RESCUE OF WOUNDED 
MAN</B> 
<P> A Floyd countian's heroism in rescuing his wounded 
section chief from <BR>a flaming battlefield in Korea 
has won for him the Army's Bronze Star. <BR> 
The decoration was conferred on Sgt. Roy Wireman Jr., son of Mrs. 
<BR>Hazel Wireman, of Wayland, for heroism in action against 
the enemy Nov. <BR>30, 1950, near Sinchang-ni. 
He is a member of the First Calvary <BR>Division's 
7th Calvary Regiment. <BR> At the time he 
earned the medal, Sgt. Wireman- then a private first <BR>class- was helping man a roadblock on a main supply route. A 
force of <BR>enemy troops, disguised as civilians, 
infiltrated through the battalion <BR>defense 
perimeter and were not disovered until they attacked Sgt. <BR>Wireman's roadblock. The citation accompanying the Wayland 
sergant's award tells that he <BR>opend fire 
immediately with his machine gun. When he was ordered to <BR>withdraw, according to the citation, "he fearlessly covered 
the <BR>displacement of the machine guns to more 
tenable positions." <BR> "When the last gun was 
emplaced," states the citation, "he finally <BR>fell 
back to rejoin his section. Upon finding his section leader 
<BR>wounded and unable to move from his position, Sgt. 
Wireman called for <BR>supporting fire. 
<BR> "Ignoring the intense hail of enemy fire," the 
citation continues, "he <BR>rushed couageously to his 
wounded comrade and carried him to safety. <BR>His 
selfless behavior and outstanding devotion to duty possibly saved 
<BR>the life of the section leader and greatly inspired the 
members of his <BR>unit."

<P><B>Blast Claims Lives of Four Friday in David Mine</B> 
<BR><B>No. 1</B> 
<P>Four men died last Friday morning, July 28, 1967, deep within a mine at David 
in what has been described as the worst mine explosion in the long history of 
Floyd county coal mining.The dead: <BR>Shannon Turner, 46, and his nephew, Ancil 
Turner, 36, both of Garrett; <BR>William Bill Titlow, 56, West Van Lear, night 
sit foreman at the mine, and <BR>George Cavins, 56, of Sitka, Johnson county. 
<P>All apparently died in one blinding moment as a spark of undetermined origin 
ignited methane gas in a section of No. 1 mine of Princess Coals, Inc. which had 
not been in operation since January 27. <BR>Time of the explosion was fixed at 
3:45 a.m. Two company employees, Jean Webb and Ray Spears reached the 
bodies around 6 a.m. and all were removed from the mine by 8 a.m., it was said. 
<BR>The explosion, investigators said, could have been of electrical orign or 
the result of smoking. A safety lamp said to have been worn by the foreman, 
Titlow, has not been found, and this is regarded an important item in the search 
for the cause of the blast. The four men went inside the inactive mine section 
to recover a coal drill and were winching a Browning hoist along the mine 
tracks. They <BR>were in Section 8 right off the south main, and were at 
or near a point, 4 1/2 miles inside the mine, where the slope begins to reach a 
lower seam of coal. Apparently, the gas had escaped from a lower level to 
where the bodies were found in the upper workings. Willard Stanley, of the 
Kentucky Bureau of Mines and Minerals, said the body of Titlow was nearest the 
outside, that Ancil Turner was 100 feet farther inside, Cavins 30 feet ahead and 
that Shannon Turner was 70 feet <BR>farther. There was evidence indicating 
that some of the doomed men had travelled about six feet toward the outside 
before being overcome.

<P><B>CAUSE OF '58 BUS DISASTER STILL A MYSTERY</B> 
<P>Crash that killed 27 left its mark on survivors 
<P>Prestonsburg--The morning of Feb. 28, 1958 was cloudy and cold, but the 
pavement on old U.S. 23 above Lancer was dry. About 7 a.m., bus driver John Alex 
DeRossett began his usual route from <BR>Cow Creek to consolidated schools in 
Prestonsburg, stopping to collect students in the communities of Sugar Loaf and 
Emma. The bus would never reach the schools. It would plunge into Levisa 
Fork <BR>of the Big Sandy River, killing 26 students and the bus driver. The 
crash happened 30 years ago today and remains the worst school bus accident in 
U.S. history. 
<P>DeRossett was on schedule. Unlike an older bus he had driven the day 
before--a bus one student described as having its rear emergency door wired 
shut--Bus No. 27 had just been serviced. <BR>About 8:10 a.m. , three miles east 
of Prestonsburg at the mouth of Knotley Hollow, DeRossett pulled off the main 
road where two 14-year-old freshman girls, Ezelle Pennington and Joyce Matney, 
stood hugging their books and waiting with six other students. Joyce, a band 
member, and Ezelle were best friends. both wore fashionably long skirts, 
bobby socks, loafers and sweaters. A week earlier, they had rdred 
identical Easter outfits. Now, they discussed a forthcoming Prestonsburg 
High School basketball game. With them stood Joyce Matney's little sister, Rita 
Cheryl, 8, who had blue-green eyes and reddish hair. Rita Cheryl was "a 
doll--the prettiest little girl that ever was," said Ezelle Pennington Copley, 
now 44 and a resident of East Point. <BR>The eight students climbed 
aboard. Someone asked Joyce Matney what her grandfather's pickup was doing 
"down there in the ditch line." About 200 yards down the highway, a pickup was 
mired to its axles in the ditch alongside the road. A wrecker driven by 
Donald "Dootney" Horn was <BR>maneuvering across the road to pull it out. 
Because the bus was almost full, Joyce and Ezelle took separate seats. Joyce and 
her little sister took seats near the front of the bus, while <BR>Ezelle found 
one near the back, a section routinely reserved for older boys. <BR>As DeRossett 
changed gears, Janice Blackburn, 14, sitting with her feet against the top of a 
rear wheel well, loked up from her book. She saw Horn's wrecker and went 
back to reading. <BR>In the back of the bus, the older boys spotted the wrecker 
and someone predicted the bus would hit it, said Donald Dillon of 
Prestonsburg, who was an eighth grader. "He had plenty of time to stop if 
he'd wanted to. Dillon does not recall a collision. But Isaac Vanderpool, 
then 17, who <BR>was sitting behind the driver, said that DeRossett yelled when 
the bus struck the wrecker's left rear bumper and fender. Aroused students began 
screaming, too, when the bus turned a hard left <BR>and started toward the 
river, striking a parked car and narrowly missing a trailor owned by Bennie 
Blackburn, Ezelle Pennington Copley remembers watching Blackburn's trailor flash 
by <BR>as the bus slid head-first down the riverbank. "I remember thinking, 
"We're going to hit the trees any second," she said. </P>
