				&nbsp;<p>His the &quot;Tender Heart of a Healer</p>
				<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Veteran Physician Is a Man 
				Of Plain Words, Many Ideas <br>
				Photo and Story by Qaentin Allen</font></b></p>
				<p>Dr. Mark Dempsey, of Garrett, has been practicing medicine 
				for more than 50 years,&nbsp; and has formed strong ideas concerning 
				the health problems of the nation, He is a man with frost on his 
				hair, a social-philosopher's mind, and the tender heart of a 
				healer. He is a man who could have gleaned a fortune from a 
				medical practice but chose, instead. The rewards of giving 
				people healthy bodies in lieu of materialistic gains. <br>
				Dr. Dempsey is a vigorous man, although he is 85. He speaks in 
				the clear, strong tones of conviction after considered thought. 
				He is plain in his beliefs: <br>
				(1) He is a New-Dealer Democrat, and makes no bones about it.
				<br>
				(2) He would not allow one penny of state relief to people who 
				smoke and drink. <br>
				(3) He believes tbat people should have free medical care. <br>
				(4) He believes that the government should spend the tax money 
				on our own people instead of <br>
				squandering&nbsp; it&nbsp; on&nbsp; &quot;drunk Frenchmen&nbsp; or&nbsp; grape-stomping 
				Italians.&quot; <br>
				(5)&nbsp; Every man, regardless of who he is, should be trained to do 
				skilled work. <br>
				Dr. Dempsey is a plain, working man who has more aspirations to 
				serve his fellowman by his <br>
				medical knowledge than gain prestige and fortune. This story&nbsp; is 
				being&nbsp; told about the doctor.&nbsp; One patient, On being counted out 
				a sizeable package of pills for his ailments, was said to have 
				told Dr. Dempsey had charged him only a dollar: &quot;Doctor, you 
				can't make any money&nbsp; selling&nbsp; your&nbsp; medicine like this.&quot; <br>
				The doctor shot back &quot;Who in the @)#@ is selling this medicine? 
				I know what I pay for it. <br>
				The doctor is not One to take &quot;sass&quot;&nbsp; But he is keenly sensitive 
				to the sufferings of the unfortunate, and his heart brings him 
				to practice the philosophy that his mind dictates. These people 
				didn't ask to come into the world. Somebody has to take care of 
				them. Only 2O%of the people in the United States can afford 
				medical treatment the doctor said.&nbsp; Dr. Dempsey and Mrs. Dempsey 
				have made their home at Garrett since 1924 when Dr. M. V Wicker 
				employed him to help out in a medical practice connected with 
				the Elk Horn&nbsp; Coal&nbsp; Corporation around Garrett and Wayland. He 
				is oringally from&nbsp; Logan West Virginia and is a third cousin of 
				Jack Dempsey the former heavyweight boxing champion of the 
				world, the doctor doesn't try to impress anyone with his famous 
				Relative. &quot;A lot of people are kin to Jack, he observes. The 
				doctor's favorite subject&nbsp; is medicine and human needs The&nbsp; 
				scientist should take over the health program. Then we'd get rid 
				of the dangerous use of tobacco.&nbsp; I've seen old-timers up and 
				down these creeks chewin their cuds like old cows. Pretty soon 
				they come to me complaining&nbsp; about how numb their legs are. 
				Their circulation is cut off. They get Burger's disease. It 
				plugs up the arteries in the legs and arms just like corks.&quot; Dr. 
				Dempsey is disgusted with the neglect of the people. When you 
				meet the man&nbsp; is ready to talk of the people's&nbsp; need to. become 
				whole and become as citizens of this country. The doctor fears 
				that his views may be misinterpreted. He is an avowed enemy of 
				totalitarianism of communism, Hitlerism or any enforced 
				subjugation of individual rights-but he can point out 
				inequalities existing&nbsp; in our system of government which might 
				be corrected, he has said&nbsp; through courageous and&nbsp; honest&nbsp; 
				leadership. All classes of people regardless of who they are, 
				should be trained to do skilled work and be disease free. Our 
				government seems to to take the attitude that, If you can't do 
				something for yourself then it won't be done. One man can't 
				shoot a rocket to the moon. It takes the experts, the 
				specialists. It takes the collective effort on the part of the 
				people through the government. <br>
				One person can't give an education to eliminate the illiteracy 
				and the disease of our people. Only the government and the 
				scientists and the experts can do this.&quot; <br>
				&quot;I have practiced medicine in more rich and poor homes than any 
				other doctor in Eastern Kentucky. I have practiced among the 
				Negro, the Jew, the Italian, the Indian. They are all the same. 
				The Negroes treated me better than anyone has ever treated me. 
				The people in the lower economic class are being neglected. &quot;The 
				experts should treat them. They should be free of disease, 
				should have free medical service as they do in Great Britain or 
				Russia.&quot; <br>
				&quot;No. I am not a Communist.&quot; But how do we hope to compete with 
				Russia? How do we compete with Russia when we have much 
				ignorance and illiteracy? You find ignorance worse in the city 
				than you do in <br>
				the country it hadn't been for some ignorant senators, Franklin 
				D. Roosevelt would have made great land reforms. He wanted to 
				irrigate the arid lands of our western states. Truman was a good 
				president. too, before the wrong men caught hold of him. &quot;I hope 
				to God that we get some statesmen who can&nbsp; deliver us from our 
				apathetic condition. &quot;The doctor thinks that medicine has 
				greatly improved over the years, especially in the continuing 
				trend of specialization. &quot;But,&quot; he said, &quot;I think that a young 
				man should spend a few years as a general practitioner. before 
				he specializes. &quot;Dr.&nbsp; Dempsey is not&nbsp; narrow. Changing patterns 
				do not scare him. In progress and betterment he finds the hope 
				of the world He said that he, as a general practitioner, can 
				treat the ordinary diseases. He added that only a specialist can 
				do a specialist's work. <br>
				Whether you agree or disagree with the veteran physician about 
				his Views, you can't say he doesn't practice what he preaches 
				about affording medical aid to the poor. Those who have known 
				him all these years. who have seen him ride, horseback, across 
				the hills, over rough, muddy roads into neighboring Knott and 
				Magoffin counties to minister to the sick will vouch for him.
				<br>
				Said one acquaintance: &quot;I've known Doc Dempsey to ride a horse 
				into Quicksand, spend two days caring for a sick woman and ride 
				back out with a sack of cabbage for his fee. And it would have 
				been all the same if he had got nothing.&quot; </p>
