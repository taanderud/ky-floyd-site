    <p>Bill Shaw ; h/o Virginia Hunter Shaw .d/o of Tandy "Dick" an Laura Smith Hunter. Actually , he was my wife's
        Sisters Husband and we had never met him, but I do have photos of him in uniform and he looks different. My
        wife's younger sister lived with them when she was 15 and she said that he always took his brief case with him
        where ever he went, and he has it with him in the photo. Small world ,isn't it. "Duh" on my part</p>
