<p><strong>Clyde & Inez <i>Addington</i> Hubbard</strong> This photo was taken on 17 October 1924 in Prestonsburg. This was the day of their wedding. Inez and Clyde are in the middle. The two young women on either side of Clyde and Inez are not yet identified. Clyde Hubbard was the son of Malcom & Lula Kendrick Hubbard. Inez was the daughter of Monroe & Francis Hubbard Addington. This photo was given to me by my aunt, Betty Hubbard Halley.</p>
