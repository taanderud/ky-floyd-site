<p>I would really love to see some old Jervis/Jarvis photos from the Floyd County area. I'd also love to know something about the photo of Elizabeth McCown that was submitted. My great great grandfather was James L. Jervis who married Evalina Burchett. Her parents were Drury Burchett and Elizabeth McCowan (b. abt. 1789 in Va.) who's father was John McCowan (b. abt. 1760). Though those in the photos may not be the same ones, I know they have to be related. Thank you, Martha athram777@yahoo.com</p>
