<p>HELP NEEDED</p>
<p>This is very important to me as this photo could be my great grandparents and my grandmother. <strong>Charles Zean Campbell, Mary Allen Campbell and Josephine Campbell.</strong> Josephine was born in 1912 in Breathitt Co. KY Mary was the daughter of Jerry and Ellen "Delia" Patton Allen of Floyd Co. Charles was the son of Robert "Knob" Campbell. Any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated</p>
