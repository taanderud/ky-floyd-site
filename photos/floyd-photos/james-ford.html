<p><strong>James Ford  </strong> picture was found in album belonging to Birdie Vaughn Childers (died abt 1986) of Richardson, Lawrence County, Ky. Birdie's daughter in law was a Ford--don't know if that is the connection or if there is
some other connection. The album was inscribed : to Lizzie Ford from sister Ella, Dec. 25, 1890. It is a beautiful collection of pictures. Submitted by <a href="mailto:coxd@zoomnet.netjpg">Donna Cox</a></p>
