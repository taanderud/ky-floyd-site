    <p>Probably taken by the Big Sandy around 1900, give or take 10 years. We believe the older woman on the left is
        Rebecca Mayo Clark (1855-approx.1916). She was the w/o Lindsey Clark. We also believe the younger women might be
        her daughters, Anna Clark</strong> (Stephens), <strong>Lulie Clark</strong> (Crisp) & <strong>Rhoda "Bossie"
            Clark (Clark). We cannot figure out who the other people are. Help would be great! Submitted by <a
