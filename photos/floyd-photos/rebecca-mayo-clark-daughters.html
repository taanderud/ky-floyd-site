<p>Probably taken by the Big Sandy around 1900, give or take 10 years. We believe the older woman on the left is <strong>Rebecca Mayo Clark</strong> (1855-approx.1916). She was the w/o Lindsey Clark. We also believe the younger women
might be her daughters, <strong>Anna Clark</strong> (Stephens), <strong>Lulie Clark</strong> (Crisp) & <strong>Rhoda "Bossie"  Clark</strong> (Clark). We cannot figure out who the other people are. Help would be great!  Submitted
