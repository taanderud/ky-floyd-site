  <p>This is a Picture of my Grandfather the first man on right is <b>Jarvie Howell</b> and the tall man in the center
    is <b>Mckenely Cox,</b> s/o Florence Martin and John Cox. I am hoping someone will recognize the women and the man
    on the left. I would love to know when and where it was taken.. Jarvie Howell looks to be about 16 . He was born
    6/30/1896.. He was s/o Elias Howell &amp; Sarah Gayheart. I hope someone can help me.</p>
