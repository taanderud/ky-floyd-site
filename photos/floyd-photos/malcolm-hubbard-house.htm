    <b>Malcolm &amp; Lula Kendrick Hubbard</b> with <b>Mary Alice Hubbard Burchett</b> and <b>Ruth Owens Burchett. </b>
    Malcolm and Mary Alice Hubbard were the children of William M. and Sarah &quot;Sallie&quot; Hammons Hubbard.&nbsp;
    Lula Kendrick was the daughter of George T. and Dicy May Kendrick.&nbsp; Ruth Burchett was the daughter of Floyd and
    Mary Alice Hubbard Burchett.&nbsp; Ruth was married to James Harvey Owens.&nbsp; This photograph was given to me by
    my cousin, Naomi Owens Day.&nbsp; I believe the photograph was taken about 1945 in Ohio.
