    <p>Josephine Campbell b.5-6-1912 Hellier,KY d.3-19-1967 Kosciusko Co.IN Daughter of Charles Zean Campbell and Mary
        Allen. Married 1925 to Joseph Wallen son of Shelby"Banks"Wallen and Rebecca Belle Gearheart. I am just guessing
        but I would say this picture was made shortly after she and Joseph were married.</p>
