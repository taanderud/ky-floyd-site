                    <p><strong>Malcolm & Lula Kendrick Hubbard</strong> with <strong>Mary Alice Hubbard Burchett</strong> and <strong>Ruth Owens Burchett.</strong> Malcolm and Mary Alice Hubbard were the children of William M. and Sarah "Sallie" Hammons Hubbard.&nbsp; Lula Kendrick was the daughter of George T. and Dicy May Kendrick.&nbsp; Ruth Burchett was the daughter of Floyd and Mary Alice Hubbard Burchett.&nbsp; Ruth was married to James Harvey Owens.&nbsp; This photograph was given to me by my cousin, Naomi Owens Day.&nbsp; I believe the photograph was taken about 1945 in Ohio.</p>
