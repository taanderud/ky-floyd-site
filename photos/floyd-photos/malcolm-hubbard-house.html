<h1>Floyd County Photos</h1>

    <p><strong>Malcolm & Lula Kendrick Hubbard</strong> with <strong>Mary Alice Hubbard Burchett</strong> and <strong>Ruth Owens Burchett.</strong> Malcolm and Mary Alice Hubbard were the children of William M. and Sarah "Sallie" Hammons Hubbard. Lula Kendrick
        was the daughter of George T. and Dicy May Kendrick. Ruth Burchett was the daughter of Floyd and Mary Alice Hubbard Burchett. Ruth was married to James Harvey Owens. This photograph was given to me by my cousin, Naomi Owens Day. I believe the
        photograph was taken about 1945 in Ohio.</p>
