                    <p>This was in my grandmothers pictures.. I believe the younger man is my grandfather, <strong>Wyatt Adkins</strong> but would love to know who the bearded man is. Also believe this was taken when they lived at either Saint Paul or Tram. He was a miner at this time. Submitted by <a href="mailto:rpinion@eastky.net">Mary Pinion</a></p>
