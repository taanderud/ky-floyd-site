<p>A Pike County man was killed and a woman was missing after torrential rains and flash flooding Friday evening throughout Eastern Kentucky left roads impassable and stranded people in their homes and vehicles, authorities said. <strong>Leslie Howell Jr.,
31, of Coon Branch</strong> near Pikeville, died when his four-wheel all-terrain vehicle stalled and turned over, and he was swept down Hurricane Creek near Pikeville around 10 p.m., police said. Kentucky State Police Sgt. Lynn Cross of Pikeville�s Post
9 said Howell and another man were riding an ATV in the area when they tried to cross a flooded roadway. When they were unable to cross, the men panicked, Cross said, and jumped off the vehicles. Witnesses said when Howell attempted to recover one of the
vehicles, he was overcome by swiftly moving water and pulled under. Howell�s body was found downstream an hour later, and resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, police said. He was pronounced dead by Pike Coroner Charles Morris at Pikeville Methodist
Hospital. Morris said results of an autopsy on Howell�s body are pending. The fire department was still looking for a woman who was swept away by waters after she exited her vehicle. Police had not revealed the woman�s identity officially, as os
presstime. The woman had exited her vehicle, which had stalled just before 11 p.m. Friday night in high water from flooding on Indian Creek. KSP Post 9 Sgt. Steve Slone said police were continuing to search many still-swelled area waterways late yesterday
afternoon for the woman. �We�re not assuming that she�s dead, we�re just trying to find her,� Cross said. Slone said police had contacted family members of the missing woman, but at their request, her identity was not being released to the media as of
presstime yesterday afternoon. Slone also said he planned to work with area fire and rescue officials to develop a description of the woman to possibly aid in locating her. The storm dumped more than four inches of rain on the area, the National Weather
Service said, while heavy rain was also reported in Letcher, Perry, Harlan and Leslie counties early yesterday. Pike Judge-Executive Karen Gibson declared a local state of emergency yesterday morning over Friday�s flooding, which she said was made worse
because some areas have already been hit by other bouts of flash flooding several times over the past four weeks. Gibson�s office in the Pike County Courthouse was buzzing with activity yesterday afternoon as state emergency officials visited the county
to begin preliminary inspections into the damage the flood waters caused. Present there yesterday afternoon was W.R. Padgett, director of the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management, who said some amount of state and federal assistance could be on its
way to Pike to assist in repairs to roads damaged by the rushing waters. Padgett also said Gov. Paul Patton was to arrive at the Pike County Regional Airport yesterday evening to begin a tour of Pike and other Eastern Kentucky counties which suffered
heavy flood damage. At that time, officials were to present Patton information collected yesterday on the flooding to assist him in determining how much flood assistance could come the county�s way, Padgett said. Some of that funding likely will go toward
road repairs and damage assistance in the flood-sacked areas of Hurricane Creek, Robinson Creek and Kimper, which reported some of the heaviest flash flooding during Friday�s downpours. Little Robinson Creek, police said, still was closed off to traffic
as of late yesterday afternoon. One resident who was stuck in the middle of one of the worst flash floods locally was Lois Ratliff. Ratliff said she woke to her daughter�s screaming Friday night. Ratliff then looked out her door, and saw a deluge of water
rushing down Hurricane Creek. �It scared me so bad I started crying,� she said. Ratliff�s own home wasn�t damaged, but Hurricane Creek residents saw a night where their drain tiles and driveways were washed away, trailers knocked loose from their
foundations and cars ended up submerged by the creek. One of her neighbors almost became another casualty, she added, when he tried to drive through the water. He was swept away, and if he hadn�t been pushed to a place where he could get out, he would
have drowned, Ratliff said. �It was extremely terrible,� she said. �It still looks really bad here. The farther up you go, the worse it gets.� The same holds true for residents near Johns Creek, Stinking Branch, Kimper and Grapevine Creek, which also saw
large amounts of water create muddy washouts and crumble blacktop to bits Friday about 9 p.m. �It�s a disaster of epic proportions,� said Johns Creek resident Johnny Daniels. �We�ve never seen anything like it.� �We need help in Johns Creek and Hurricane,
and plenty of it,� said Jeanette Daniels. Hurricane resident Troy Slone said material from abandoned mine works had slid down the hillside onto the back of his mobile home, and behind that area and down the creek, the entire mountain is in danger of
sliding into about three more houses. Massive mudslides already had pushed one mobile home from its foundation and into a nearby roadway there. Floodwaters in much of the area were beginning to recede by midmorning yesterday. Police reported a man in
neighboring Floyd County was found yesterday after he was swept away by floodwaters and reported missing. Officials said Pike, Floyd and Perry counties were the hardest hit by the flooding, while Leslie, Harlan and Letcher counties suffered minor
flooding. Patrick Conley, a spokesman with the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management, said Floyd County had also been declared in a state of emergency due to flooding on Mud Creek, Left Beaver Creek and several minor creeks. Conley said local
officials reported the worst damage to Ky. 979 in the Branhams Creek Road area. Early estimates, Conley said, showed that some amounts of water had affected as many as 200 homes in Floyd County. Four different shelters had been set up in the county to
house those flooded out of their homes. Pikeville�s Post 9 had received at least 100 reports of people stranded in their homes or cars Friday night. Editor�s note: The Associated Press and Grapevine resident James O. Bevins contributed to this report.</p>

millions of dollars in damage and probably damaged more than 1,000 homes. (AP Photo/Rhonda Simpson)</p>
