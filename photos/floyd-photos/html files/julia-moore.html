                    <p><strong>Julia Moore:</strong> It's my husband's grandmother. She had these cards made up when she was running for jailer. I like her platform, " I will feed you good and treat you with courtesy". I think this is the only card in existence anymore.&nbsp; Submitted by <a href="mailto:suzeann@apk.net">Suzeann Moore</a></p>
