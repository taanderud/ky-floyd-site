    <p>This is a picture of my Grandmother, Viola (Saylers) Bates, holding my Uncle, Harold Dean Bates, with my Uncle Julius C. Bates and my Mother, Justine (Betty) Bates Meade standing on either side of her. This picture was taken in the late 30's or early
        forty's at Dry Creek in Knott County.</p>
