<h1>Floyd County Photos</h1>

    <p>This is a Picture of my Grandfather the first man on right is <strong>Jarvie Howell</strong> and the tall man in the center is <strong>Mckenely Cox,</strong> s/o Florence Martin and John Cox. I am hoping someone will recognize the women and the man
        on the left. I would love to know when and where it was taken.. Jarvie Howell looks to be about 16 . He was born 6/30/1896.. He was s/o Elias Howell & Sarah Gayheart. I hope someone can help me.</p>
