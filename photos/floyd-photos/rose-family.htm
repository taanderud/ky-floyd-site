    Rose, Mollie Rose Wright, Fannie Rose Burns, Jessie Rose Back row from left Bennie Rose and father of family, Ben
    Rose. The photo was taken in 1961 at the foot of the hill where the Miller cemetery is located in Spurlock Branch,
    Floyd Co. KY<br> I believe this picture was made the day of my grandmother, Arena Conley Roses&nbsp;funeral.
