<h1>Floyd County Family Pictures</h1>
<p><img src="images/aunt-norrie.jpg" width="277" height="381" alt="Aunt-Norrie"></p>
<p>I'm researching the Dillon family from Floyd County Kentucky. While researching and looking at pictures, I have come up with names that I'm not sure how they are related. My mother identifies this picture as Aunt Norrie Burchett Blackburn (the
daughter of Aunt Nell?) with her daughter Dorothy and son Billy Burchett. My mother remembers Dorothy marrying a DeRossett maybe Robie? Supposedly Aunt Norrie married a Frank Burchett and then later married a Blackburn. Just wanted to submit
this and see if anyone as any information.</p>
