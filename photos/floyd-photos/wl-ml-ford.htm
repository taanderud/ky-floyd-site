        <b>W. L. or M. L. Ford</b>, was in a pink envelope; inscribed on the back of the picture was the note: to my
        intended Aug. __1874.&nbsp; picture was found in album belonging to Birdie Vaughn Childers (died abt 1986) of
        Richardson, Lawrence County, Ky. Birdie's daughter in law was a Ford--don't know if that is the connection or if
        there is some other connection. The album was inscribed : to Lizzie Ford from sister Ella, Dec. 25, 1890. It is
        a beautiful collection of pictures. <font size="2">
