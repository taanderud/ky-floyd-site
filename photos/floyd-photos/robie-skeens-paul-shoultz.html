    <p>This picture was in my mother's album and on the back it said <strong>Robie Skeens</strong> & <strong><i>Paul Shoultz</i></strong>, (may be spelled wrong). I think maybe this is Floyd Skeens Father? Submitted by <a href="mailto:meannygranny@hotmail.comjpg">Judy Stambaugh</a>        Submitter died May, 2001</p>
