<p><strong>NEW INFO</strong></p>
<p>This photo is hung in a Baptist Church in Knott County and has been there for years ; but the name on it is William & Biddie Triplett -Not Jesse & Lisa (Wicker) Hayes as it is on your site .</p>
<p>My wife's 90 year old cousin says it is her ggrandma Biddie (Oney) Triplett</p>
