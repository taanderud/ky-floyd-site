  <p><b>Josephine Campbell</b> b.5-6-1912 Hellier,KY d.3-19-1967 Kosciusko Co.IN Daughter of Charles Zean Campbell and
    Mary Allen. Married 1925 to Joseph Wallen son of Shelby&quot;Banks&quot;Wallen and Rebecca Belle Gearheart. I am
    just guessing but I would say this picture was made shortly after she and Joseph were married.</p>
