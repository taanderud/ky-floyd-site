    <b>James Ford&nbsp;&nbsp; </b> picture was found in album belonging to Birdie Vaughn Childers (died abt 1986) of
    Richardson, Lawrence County, Ky. Birdie's daughter in law was a Ford-don't know if that is the connection or if
    there is some other connection. The album was inscribed : to Lizzie Ford from sister Ella, Dec. 25, 1890. It is a
    beautiful collection of pictures.
