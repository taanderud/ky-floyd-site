  <p><strong>"The Old Empty Schoolhouse"</strong> Author Ralph Hall Written about Weeksbury Elementary School&nbsp; Closed it doors in 1963</p>
  <p>"The Old Empty Schoolhouse" Quietly she set upon a hill Empty now which once was filled. But now the air is filled with silence, For there are no words. Broken windows and empty seats. A giant teacher now sets in defeat. There are no children in her halls, who now play. She has nothing to do all the live long day. Math, reading, and writing she once taught. Teachers, Doctors, and Lawyers she brought. Fine Fathers and Mothers, in her rooms once learned. It's for the old days the schoolhouse, now yeans. A small community she once did serve. And the highest of honor, The old schoolhouse deserves. "A fine school she was" Oh! how she taught us to think, And those who never tried always got spanked. They say she served her purpose. And for her there is no need. That in her time she did her good deeds. So lonely and sad she sets upon the hill. Her roof is caving in, her doors has fallen down. But she was a great teacher in a small country town. Now students are bussed to a place far away. But for us who can remember, We still love the old schoolhouse, of yesterday. So old schoolhouse so lonely, empty, silent, and still. Please don't be sad and mourn all day. But look to the past, When laughter was heard in your hall's. For history will prove, That you will out last us all. I love you old schoolhouse, That sets upon the hill.</p>
