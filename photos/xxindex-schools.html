                Here is a photo of my grandmothers class photo. She thinks it was called Antioch and was in Floyd
                county. She is the only one identified in the photo. She is the second from the left in the second row
                not the girl standing behind her. Feel free to place it on the website. I may also send it to the
                Kentucky Explorer magazine. My grandmothers name was Betty Johnson and is now Betty Tackett.
                <strong>Maybe someone will recognize this photo</strong>.
