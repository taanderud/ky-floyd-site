                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>We may use cookies in order to customize this site for return visitors. These cookies are not
                    required for site functionality. Additionally, third-party widgets such as YouTube or Flickr may
                    install cookies depending on their configuration.  You are not required to accept any cookies to use
                    this site.</p>
                <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
                <p>We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google
                    Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when
                    they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we
                    get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address
                    assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying
                    information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with
                    personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web
                    browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be
                    used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google
                    Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a
                        href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> (as amended
                    for government websites) and the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy
                        Policy</a>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site
                    by <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml">disabling cookies</a> on your browser.</p>
