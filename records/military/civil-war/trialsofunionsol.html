 <p><strong>The Trials of a Union Soldier</strong> &nbsp;By Lieutenant James M. Thornbury, 39th Kentucky Mounted Infantry Submitted by <a href="mailto:sixstrings6@yahoo.com"><strong>John D. Thornsbury</strong></a></p>

 <p> Editor's note: As poems go, this one isn't very good. But, it does have a good deal of</p>
 <p> historical detail, and it is probably the best example of literacy produced by any of the&nbsp; 39th's veterans.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;[Allegedly written on Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tennessee, December 10th, 1864]</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p> &nbsp;<strong> </strong> <strong>On the ninth of January Eighteen and Sixty-four</strong></p>
 <p><strong> I was taken by the rebels on the Big Sandy Shore.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> My sword and pistol they quickly took away</strong></p>
 <p><strong> I stood there in the snow and not a word could say.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong> My pocket book and money I quickly threw them down</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; And made them believe I surely had none.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> They marched me to Witheville and there I took the car</strong></p>
 <p><strong> From there I went to Richmond a prisoner of war.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; And there I remained until three months rolled around</strong></p>
 <p><strong> And during all this time my feet were not on ground.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> In Libby Prison I was kept until the seventh of May</strong></p>
 <p><strong> So quickly we got orders and then marched away.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; We were then transported down to Macon town</strong></p>
 <p><strong> In the state of Ga., one thousand miles from home.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; My troubles there were great and not very much to eat</strong></p>
 <p><strong> In the sun we were kept and nearly died with heat.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong> The fall of Atlanta was the cause of General Hood</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; To begin his retreat and that was very good.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> And when the news of it came it did quickly sound</strong></p>
 <p><strong> The prisoners they must leave and go to Charleston.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong> And when we got there near the ocean shore</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; The sound of Fosters cannon soon begin to roar.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> The shells they did fly, the town begin to burn</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; And it was very funny to see the rebels run.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; And it was not very long until we were carried down</strong></p>
 <p><strong> To Columbia, South Carolina, the course is not known.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> The camp was very bad what time that I remained</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; And not a house nor shelter to keep us from the rain.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong> So one day I concluded no longer would I stay</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; With boldness and courage I quickly marched away.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> The Southern Confederacy,Oh it I left behind</strong></p>
 <p><strong> And started up the river a better land to find.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong> And when I arrived at Knoxville, Tennessee,</strong></p>
 <p><strong> I was treated like a brother and set at liberty.</strong></p>
 <p><strong> And now I have met my friends in communion</strong></p>
 <p><strong> &nbsp; Where the Stars and Stripes are waving for the Union.</strong></p>
