    <h1>The Trials of a Union Soldier </h1>

    <p> Editor's note: As poems go, this one isn't very good. But, it does have a good deal of</p>
    <p> historical detail, and it is probably the best example of literacy produced by any of the 39th's veterans.</p>
    <p>[Allegedly written on Lookout Mountain, Chattanooga, Tennessee, December 10th, 1864]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> On the ninth of January Eighteen and Sixty-four</p>
    <p> I was taken by the rebels on the Big Sandy Shore.</p>
    <p> My sword and pistol they quickly took away</p>
    <p> I stood there in the snow and not a word could say.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> My pocket book and money I quickly threw them down</p>
    <p> And made them believe I surely had none.</p>
    <p> They marched me to Witheville and there I took the car</p>
    <p> From there I went to Richmond a prisoner of war.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> And there I remained until three months rolled around</p>
    <p> And during all this time my feet were not on ground.</p>
    <p> In Libby Prison I was kept until the seventh of May</p>
    <p> So quickly we got orders and then marched away.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> We were then transported down to Macon town</p>
    <p> In the state of Ga., one thousand miles from home.</p>
    <p> My troubles there were great and not very much to eat</p>
    <p> In the sun we were kept and nearly died with heat.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> The fall of Atlanta was the cause of General Hood</p>
    <p> To begin his retreat and that was very good.</p>
    <p> And when the news of it came it did quickly sound</p>
    <p> The prisoners they must leave and go to Charleston.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> And when we got there near the ocean shore</p>
    <p> The sound of Fosters cannon soon begin to roar.</p>
    <p> The shells they did fly, the town begin to burn</p>
    <p> And it was very funny to see the rebels run.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> And it was not very long until we were carried down</p>
    <p> To Columbia, South Carolina, the course is not known.</p>
    <p> The camp was very bad what time that I remained</p>
    <p> And not a house nor shelter to keep us from the rain.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> So one day I concluded no longer would I stay</p>
    <p> With boldness and courage I quickly marched away.</p>
    <p> The Southern Confederacy,Oh it I left behind</p>
    <p> And started up the river a better land to find.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> And when I arrived at Knoxville, Tennessee,</p>
    <p> I was treated like a brother and set at liberty.</p>
    <p> And now I have met my friends in communion</p>
    <p> Where the Stars and Stripes are waving for the Union.</p>
