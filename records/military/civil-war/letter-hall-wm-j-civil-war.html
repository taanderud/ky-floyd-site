                    <p>H Co. 10th Cav. Regt.</p>
                    <p>January 7th, 1864</p>
                    <p><br></p>
                    <p>Maj. Hoddard Johnson</p>
                    <p>and</p>
                    <p>Dept. of KY. and East Tenn.</p>
                    <p>I would respectfully ask permission to visit my home in North Eastern KY. for the following
                        reasons. The enemy who made a recent raid on this part of the country on returning paid my
                        family a visit and literally distroyed anything the had accumalated to live upon for the winter,
                        I am a poor man and no one left at my home except my wife + some little children who are not
                        large enough to aid or assist her. She is destitute of means by which she might procure
                        something to live upon. The enemy not only distroyed grain, but took nearly all my household. I
                        can by returning afford them clothing and when I get home can procure supplies-- I will rejoin
                        my command within (30) thirty days. I live at Floyd County KY. a distance of about (30) thirty
                        miles. </p>
                    <p>Hoping that the leave I ask may be granted.</p>
                    <p>I am your most Obedient Servant</p>
                    <p>William J. Hall Captain</p>
