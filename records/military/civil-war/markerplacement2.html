                <p><strong>New Confederate Markers in Place In Floyd County</strong></p>
                <p>Here is an update on the Confederate stones the Caudill Camp has now set in Floyd County, Kentucky as of Tuesday, January 25, 2000.&nbsp; Yesterday three of our members helped to set our camp's 21st marker in Floyd County.&nbsp; This was
                    accomplished despite the fact that with the bitterly cold wind it felt like nearly zero temperatures and the ground was frozen hard.&nbsp; But when we find the time we want to get out to the cemeteries every day if at all possible
                    either to set stones or look for more soldiers.&nbsp; This Monday and Tuesday we were in Floyd and Knott County checking cemeteries and setting stones.&nbsp; The following men of the 13th Kentucky Cavalry now have new Confederate granite
                    markers in Floyd County:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;1. SERGEANT REUBEN M. ALLEN - Allen Cemetery, Warco</p>
                <p>&nbsp;2. PRIVATE ALFRED AMBURGEY &nbsp;- Lancer Cemetery, Lancer</p>
                <p>&nbsp;3. PRIVATE THOMAS H. AMBURGEY&nbsp; - Lancer Cemetery, Lancer</p>
                <p>&nbsp;4. PRIVATE JACOB BRYANT &nbsp;- Newman Cemetery, Price</p>
                <p>&nbsp;5. LIEUTENANT ADAM GEARHART&nbsp; - Gearhart Cemetery, Hueysville</p>
                <p>&nbsp;6. PRIVATE JOHN B. GEARHART &nbsp;- Gearhart Cemetery, Hueysville</p>
                <p>&nbsp;7. SERGEANT ALAN C. HAGANS &nbsp;- Hagans Cemetery, Eastern</p>
                <p>&nbsp;8. PRIVATE EPPERSON HAYES - Hezekiah Hayes Cemetery, Turkey Creek</p>
                <p>&nbsp;9. PRIVATE SYLVESTER HAYES&nbsp; - Allen Cemetery, Hueysville</p>
                <p>10. PRIVATE ABISHA JOHNSON &nbsp;- Matthew Tackett Cemetery, Melvin</p>
                <p>11. PRIVATE ELI JOHNSON - Matthew Tackett Cemetery, Melvin</p>
                <p>12. PRIVATE ELISHA JOHNSON&nbsp; - Tackett Cemetery, Hen Pen Creek, Melvin 13. PRIVATE HARVEY JOHNSON - Harve Johnson Cemetery, Melvin</p>
                <p>14. CAPTAIN ADAM MARTIN - John Martin Cemetery, Wayland</p>
                <p>15. PRIVATE JAMES MARTIN &nbsp;- Martin Cemetery, Drift</p>
                <p>16. SERGEANT JOSEPH MARTIN &nbsp;- Watt Martin Cemetery, Wayland</p>
                <p>17. PRIVATE WILLIAM J. MARTIN - Martin Cemetery, Estill</p>
                <p>18. PRIVATE REPTS OSBORNE - Osborne Cemetery, Garth Hollow</p>
                <p>19. PRIVATE HENRY C. PATTON - Allen Cemetery, Warco</p>
                <p>20. PRIVATE MATTHEW TACKETT - Matthew Tackett Cemetery, Melvin</p>
                <p>21. PRIVATE MORGAN TURNER &nbsp;- Morgan Turner Cemetery, McDowell&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We were unable to set the stone the other day for Corporal James H. Wright.&nbsp; Even after receiving directions on this one we had to stop about six times, talk to people in the Bucks Branch area and make more phone calls from the truck.&nbsp;
                    Finally the nearest property owner simply pointed to a dense brushy area and said he's unmarked, but buried "way out that way somewhere." After pulling away the briars for over an hour, crossing back and forth along the creek bed,
                    we did locate the grave.&nbsp; He is marked, "sort of."&nbsp; On a large natural rock mostly buried in the ground and down a very steep bank is hand carved - James Wright and his correct dates!&nbsp; The other four or so graves there
                    have small rocks with nothing on them.&nbsp; Although that day we did finally locate his grave we did not have enough rope to let the stone down the 40 foot embankment.&nbsp; We set six stones that day but had to bring the James Wright
                    stone back.&nbsp; We of course will set that at our next opportunity.&nbsp; We also have recently received a stone for Private Daniel S. Scott who is buried at the head of Stone Coal Creek near Garrett.&nbsp; We plan to set that one
                    and Wright's stone the same day.&nbsp; Also we are currently continuing the research on a number of other sites in Floyd County.&nbsp; If anyone is interested I can provide exact directions should you want to visit the graves of any
                    of the soldiers listed above. Our camp's total</p>
                <p>number set as of today is 334 Confederate markers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Sincerely,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Faron Sparkman&nbsp;&nbsp; Col. Ben Caudill Camp</p>
