<h1>Ivy Mountain Monument</h1>
<p> <img border="0" src="images/ivy-mtn.jpg"></p>
<p>The Ivy Mountain Battlefield Monument is located on U.S. Route 23 between Prestonsburg and Pikeville. It stands on
	Kentucky Highway Department property a few hundred yards north of the Ivel Post Office and the mouth of Ivy Creek. It
	was here, on November 8th, 1861, that the Battle of Ivy Mountain was fought. Plans are in the works to landscape the
	land around the monument and create a small picnic area on the riverbank below it. The two fiberglass panels which
	flank the monument will contain pictures, maps, and texts giving further information about the battle and the people
	who fought it. </p>
