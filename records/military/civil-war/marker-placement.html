                    <p>Here is an update on the Confederate stones the Caudill Camp has now set in Floyd County,
                        Kentucky as of Tuesday, January 25, 2000. Yesterday three of our members helped to set our
                        camp's 21st marker in Floyd County. This was accomplished despite the fact that with the
                        bitterly cold wind it felt like nearly zero temperatures and the ground was frozen hard. But
                        when we find the time we want to get out to the cemeteries every day if at all possible either
                        to set stones or look for more soldiers. This Monday and Tuesday we were in Floyd and Knott
                        County checking cemeteries and setting stones. The following men of the 13th Kentucky Cavalry
                        now have new Confederate granite markers in Floyd County:</p>

                    <h2>Corporal James H Wright</h2>
                    <p>We were unable to set the stone the other day for Corporal James H. Wright. Even after receiving
                        directions on this one we had to stop about six times, talk to people in the Bucks Branch area
                        and make more phone calls from the truck. Finally the nearest property owner simply pointed to a
                        dense brushy area and said he's unmarked, but buried "way out that way somewhere." After pulling
                        away the briars for over an hour, crossing back and forth along the creek bed, we did locate the
                        grave. He is marked, "sort of." On a large natural rock mostly buried in the ground and down a
                        very steep bank is hand carved - James Wright and his correct dates! The other four or so graves
                        there have small rocks with nothing on them. Although that day we did finally locate his grave
                        we did not have enough rope to let the stone down the 40 foot embankment. We set six stones that
                        day but had to bring the James Wright stone back. We of course will set that at our next
                        opportunity. We also have recently received a stone for Private Daniel S. Scott who is buried at
                        the head of Stone Coal Creek near Garrett. We plan to set that one and Wright's stone the same
                        day. Also we are currently continuing the research on a number of other sites in Floyd County.
                        If anyone is interested I can provide exact directions should you want to visit the graves of
                        any of the soldiers listed above. Our camp's total number set as of today is 334 Confederate
                        markers. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
