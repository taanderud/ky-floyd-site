  <h1>Floyd County War Veterans</h1>
  <p>Published by Glenda Smith</p>
  <p>Several years ago a notebook containing names of war Veterans of Floyd County, the wars they served in, and the cemeteries in which they were buried was given in a column of The Floyd County Times dated March 6, and March 20, 1958.
  <p>The notebook was the work of the American Legion which was seeking to locate and mark the graves. It contains scores of entries, some of the information on many Veterans being incomplete and there was much scribbling as several persons handled the book. This
    article now attempts to publish the information assembled by the Veterans. If some of the important data is obscure, in error or left off, remember the compilation was the work of others. Some of the men named may not be veterans at all.
  <p>Note: The original article was printed in three parts. All of the names that follows are from the first two parts, I regret that the last part was not among my findings.
  <p>Names of the Veterans and the data about them as found in the notebook follows:</p>
