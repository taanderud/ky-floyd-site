    <h1>Floyd County War Veterans</h1>
    <p>Published by Glenda Smith</p>
    <p>Several years ago a notebook containing names of war Veterans of Floyd County, the wars they served in, and the
        cemeteries in which they were buried was given in a column of The Floyd County Times dated March 6, and March
        20, 1958. </p>
    <p>The notebook was the work of the American Legion which was seeking to locate and mark the graves. It contains
        scores of entries, some of the information on many Veterans being incomplete and there was much scribbling as
        several persons handled the book. This article now attempts to publish the information assembled by the
        Veterans. If some of the important data is obscure, in error or left off, remember the compilation was the work
        of others. Some of the men named may not be veterans at all. </p>
    <p>Note: The original article was printed in three parts. All of the names that follows are from the first two
        parts, I regret that the last part was not among my findings. </p>
    <p>Names of the Veterans and the data about them as found in the notebook follows:</p>
