      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In testimony whereof, I have hereunto</p>
      <p>set my hand, and affixed the Seal of said Court,</p>
      <p>on this thirtieth day of August, AD 1820</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.

      <p>State of New Jersey</p>
      <p>Sussex County</p>
      <p>On this twenty fourth day of August 1819 before me the Subscriber one of the Judges of the court of Common Pleas in and for the Said County Personally appeared Reuben Sammons otherwise called Simons aged about sixty years & resident in the Said County who being by me first sworn according to law doth on his oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the provisions made by the Late Act of Congress entitled �an act to provide for certain Persons engaged in the Land & Naval Service of the United States in the revolutionary war[�] that he Reuben Sammons Inlisted in the said county of Sussex in the State of New Jersey in the company commanded by Captain William Helms in the [2nd?] New Jersey Regiment commanded by Col. Dehart on or about the first of May 1781 in the Revolutionary War.&nbsp; That he served in the said company untill after the taking Cornwallis at York Town and his return to Morris Town New Jersey when he was transferred to Captain Bowman�s Company after which the [2nd?] Regiment was broken and he was transferred to Captain Mitchels company of Lite infantry & the New Jersey brigade.&nbsp; That he continued in the Service of the United States untill about the first of June 1783 when he was discharged from service as Newburgh [word unclear] in the State of New York.&nbsp; That he was at the taking of Cornwallis at York Town.&nbsp; And that he is in reduced circumstances and stands in need of the assistance of his country for support and that he has no other evidence but what is herewith sent now in his [word unclear] of his said Service.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his</p>
      <p>Sworn to & subscribed before me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John&nbsp; X Sammons&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>the day and year aforesaid&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I John Gustin Judge as aforesaid do certify that it appears to my satisfaction that the Said Ruben Sammons did serve in the revolutionary war as stated in the preceding declaration against the common enemy and to my knowledge he is in Reduced Circumstances & needs the assistance of this country for support and I now transmit the proceedings and testimony taken [word unclear] before me to the Secretary of War pursuant to the depution of the aforesaid Act of Congress given under my hand & the Seal of the Said Court the 24th day of August 1819</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Gustin&nbsp;</p>
      <p>[[****Note:&nbsp; The text clearly says John vice Reuben.&nbsp; Since a later document shows that Reuben moved to Greenbrier County, Virginia it is probable that he is related to John Sammons who was also born in Sussex County and moved to Greenbrier County after the war.&nbsp; It is possible to speculate that if indeed they were brothers John might have been in Sussex County at the time and accompanying Reuben and Judge Gustin accidentally filled in John�s name, rather than Reuben�s.&nbsp; Again, strictly wild speculation.]]</p>
      <p>[NB:&nbsp; File contains the poor copy of an envelope with a postmark of Greenbrier Co. VA, addressed to the War Department in Washington.&nbsp; The envelope appears to have the following notation probably inscribed by a clerk as a record of action:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reuben Sammons�</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or Simmons� application</p>
      <p>for transfer to Virginia</p>
      <p>Transferred 29 June 1821</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The following is probably the enclosure of the letter:</p>
      <p>To the Secretary of War or to the War Department</p>
      <p>I have herewith enclosed to you my application for a transfer of my pension claim from New Jersey to Virginia.&nbsp; You will do me a very particular favour if you will decree an account of my Transfer as soon as possible so I can dray my pension in Virginia against the 11th of September next as I cannot get necessaries here untill I get an act. Of my transfer as people do not like to trust me on account of my pension certificate being payable in Jersey.&nbsp; Your attention will confer a very great favour on an old Revolutionary Soldier.&nbsp; You will plase to direct the Transfer to my self or to Lewes Steward, Clerk of Greenbrier County.</p>
