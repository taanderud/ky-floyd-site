              <p><strong>REV. WAR RECORD; William Brown, Floyd Co., KY</strong> Submitted to the KyGenWeb by: J.P. Downard May 28, 1999 ab4rx@iglou.com ************************************************************************ Here is the Pension Application from the Floyd Co. Annals: ANNALS OF FLOYD COUNTY, KENTUCKY COUNTY COURT BOOK 4 William Brown, an old Revolutionary Soldier, produced in open&nbsp; court his schedule for the purpose of obtaining a pension as follows; On this 26th day of September, 1825, personally appeared in open court, being a court of record for the County of Floyd, William Brown a resident in said County aged 78 years, who first being duly sworn according to law doth on ;is oath make the following declaration.&nbsp; That the said William Brown entered the service of the United States as an Ensign in the fall of the year 1780 in the State of Virginia, in the company commanded by Captain John Henry in the 13th Virginia Regiment commanded by Col. Dabbony in the line of the State of Virginia on Continental Establishment. That he continued to serve in said Corps in said office until November, 1781, after the surrender of Cornwallis, which was on the 19th day of October, 1781, when he was discharged from the service of the ttate of Virginia about four miles below Richmond at Rocketts Landing, that he hereby relinquishes every claim whatsoever to a pension except the present, that his name is not on the roll of any state but Kentucky, and that the following are the reasons for not making earlier application for a pension; I have been for about 7 or 8 years living with one of my son-. in-laws by the name of George Pack and him together with his family with what little assistance I could render supported me, that my son- in-law with whom I did live is now dead and has left a helpless widow and family who are not more able to support themselves. I have for several years past have been advised to make an All which said slaves are ordered by the court to be freed and application for a pension, but I thought I never would do it so long as I could support with out because I thought and knew that I had rendered much service to my country in the achievement of its liberty, I therefore determined never to be a public charge to my country so long as I could possibly avoid it by what little labor I was able to render and what assistance my friend was willing to give me for the reguard he had for me as a relation and what little work 1 was able to do but he is now dead and from age and infirmity I am unable any longer to support myself. I have no family but myself nor has not had for about 8 years past. My occupation has been that of a famer but am now from age and infirmity unable to persue it. That I have no other property . or securities other rhan what is contained in thr schedule here to annexed and by me subscribed. SCHEDULE: One old mare and colt worth $35.00 Three head of cattle at $6 each 18.00 (S) William Brown The following changes has been made in my property since the year 1818. That that time I had one horse which I swaped for the mare I now own with one Charles Pack, about three years since, and since the mare has had the colt above named. Also in the year 1818 I had about the same number of cattle I have now, that is three, but they had some young ones, which are the same above stated, and I killed the old ones for beef, I think three, to support myself. (I think the name Pack is Bach. Could this be the f/o the two BROWN sisters that married into the HENRY COMBS Family?
