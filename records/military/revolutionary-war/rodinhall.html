                <p><strong>Pension for Rodin Hall</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>State of Kentucky County of Floyd On this 26th day of June 1853 personally appeared before me the undersigned a Justice of the Peace within the county aforesaid, Rodin Hall a resident of Floyd County aged 67 years who being first duly
                    sworn according to law doth on his oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the provisions made by the laws of the United States passed on the 3rd day of February 1853. That he is the identical man who
                    was a Private in a Company of Virginia Militia commanded by Captain John Hammons from the County of Russell in the State of Virginia in the 6th Regiment of Virginia Militia commanded by Colonel Henry E. Coleman in the War known as
                    the War of 1812 declared by the United States against Great Britain. He was marched to Norfolk in the State of Virginia and mustered into actual service and from exposure while in actual service and in the line of duty he contracted
                    a disease called "camp fever" which from exposure while in actual service and in the line of his duty the said fever settled in his limbs and so effected the spinal marrow of his back that he was found unfit for the service and received
                    a sick discharge which is now on file in the City of Washington he having received his bounty land for the same and he has been disabled from getting his subsistence from manual labor ever since he contracted the disease above named.
                    And he further states on his oath that the Captain he marched under is now dead and he hath just cause to believe the the Colonel in command is also dead as he was a tolesable old man when in the service with him. As to the other officers
                    that I was under I do not know any thing of their whereabouts as I live some five hundred miles from where I last heard from them, the Physicians that examined me in the time of my affliction in the service and while in the army their
                    names I cannot recollect nor can I tell where they reside, the only witnesses that I can procure or that I know and that resides in any reasonable distance of me is the two whose affidavits accompany my application which I pray the
                    Commissioner of Pensions to read in my behalf his Rodin X Hall mark Sworn to and subscribed before me this 26th day of June 1853 and I certify that I have no interest in this case and am not concerned in its prosecutions David Cooley
