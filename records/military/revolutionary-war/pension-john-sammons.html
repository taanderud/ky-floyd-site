      <p>State of Virginia</p>
      <p>Greenbrier County</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on this 9th day of July 1833 personally appeared before me Henry Erskine a Justice of the Peace in and for said county John Sammons aged 74 years who being first duly sworn according to law doth on his oath make the following further declaration in order to obtain the benefit of the provisions of the Act of Congress passed 7th June 1833 [sic].</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There appearing to be some objection to his declaration on the 24th September 1832 and explanation to be made which he feels well satisfied to do.&nbsp; In the first objection stated that on or about 1st Sept 1777 he entered into the service for five or six months he does not recollect which to satisfy which he will plan this service at five months this much time he is sure he entered the service for and served as stated in his declaration of 24th September 1832.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd&nbsp; Objection in year 1778 he served two months and was called upon to serve a third and so on untill he served four or five months at different times at Elizabeth Town and Amboy.&nbsp; He now states that he is sure of having served five months that is embracing first second and third months as intended to be allowed then two months are to be embraced in the five months which he is sure he served in this year as set forth in his declaration of 24th Sept 1832.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd&nbsp; Objection is as to the service in scouting parties in which it is stated he served two months and upwards.&nbsp; He states that he is well satisfied of having served in this service more than two months but as it has been a long time and he cannot bring his mind to a proper [word unclear] of the particular time he is willing to place it at two months but well knows its is under the proper time he served.&nbsp; He states he is [word unclear] as to the other service set forth in his declaration of 24 Sept 1832 it is unnecessary to state anything as further explanation of them as there appears to be no objection to them.&nbsp; But he states when he made his declaration of 24th Sept. 1832 he entirely forgot one month and a very important month of his service which was a months service he thinks in the year 1779 in month of June he was detached to serve one month and&nbsp; put under Capt. Richard Etsell and was marched from Sussex County New Jersey to a place called Pyrammus [probably Paramus] near Hackingsack [Hackansack] River New Jersey.&nbsp; During this months service the company had had severe service to encounter in guarding the settlement against the enemy and Tories which were numerous in that settlement and had several severe skirmishes with the enemy in which three men were killed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that he in signing his name wrote the name Summons.&nbsp; He states the reason it was written in that way he is not accustomed to write his name and committed the mistake himself that his name is as stated in his declaration Sammons.</p>
