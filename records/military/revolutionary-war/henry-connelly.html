                    Of Captian Henry Connelly & Tempy Connelly ------------------------------------------------------------------- Declaration in order to obtain this benefit of this act of Congress passed June&nbsp; 7th 1832 State of Kentucky County
                    of Floyd. Declaration On this 15th day of August, 1833, personally appeared before I James Davis Justice of the peace now setting HENRY CONNELLY a resident of Floyd County and State of Kentucky. Age Eighty-One years, who being first
                    duly sworn according to law doth on his oath make the following declaration, in order to obtain the benefit of the act of congress passed June 7th 1832. That he enlisted the service of the United States under the following named officers
                    and served as herein stated: That he enlisted the service and commanded one hundred men as state troops of North Carolina (called militia) as the Captain thereof on the 7th day of July, 1777, for five years or during the war. In the
                    County of Guilford North Carolina -- his Col. in the first instance was Col. John Williams, then under Leut. Pacely, then by Leut. John Taylor and lastly by Col. Billy Washington. This applicant�s Company was a horse company & was
                    raised for the especial purpose of keeping down a dareing Tory Col. by the name of Fanning who had made several daring attempts in the neighborhood of Sailsbury and Charlotte, during the first year of the service of this applicant,
                    by the orders of his Col. the company transversed and marched to Rowan, and Guilford in order to keep Fanning and his Confederates down. During this year, in the month of October, The company encountered his scouts and routed them
                    with some loss. The General rendezvous of the Tories was in that region of the country called Haw Ford on Haw River. These counties and the adjacent neighborood was assigned to this applicant�s charge by his Excellency the Governor
                    of North Carolina in the month of June 1778. This this applicant and his company continued to do during this year 1778. And that winter he and his company rendezvoused at Salisbury. The particulars of this year�s services was only
                    a few fights with the Tories. The war was raging in the North, whither that delingusished and and officer, Col. William Davidson had gone, and all remaining for the continental authorities to do was to keep down the Tories, which where
                    so numerous in this region of N. Carolina. During this year, 1778, the men suffered much for cloths and every necessary, and our forage master frequently had to press for our perishing horses. Continental money was there one hundred
                    dollars was for one - for this applicant could not get a breakfast for $100 in Continental money. During this year, by the orders of the Governor, this applicant�s company was placed under the direction of Col. Davie, who then commanded
                    the North Carolina Cavalry, but he renewed the old orders, and my district still remained as they were under my former orders.-- Early in March 1779 the tories broke out with great fury at a place called Haw Fields, whither this applicant
                    and his company repaired and disloged them with the assistance of Col. Lyttle from Rowan, who commanded a Regt. of militia. During this year the tories were fast accumulatinng in Rowan, and this applicant�s Horse Company was most withdrawn
                    from Guilford to that section of North Carolina. The Whigs this year took a great many tories, who were all put in jail and contained at Hilsboro and Sailsbury. In the month of November 1779, orders were received by Col. Pacely from
                    Col. Davie the commanding Col. to rendezvous at Sailsbury to start to the South to join Gen. Lincoln at Savannah, but about this time news arrived that Gen. Lincoln was overtaken at Charlestown, and all was taken prisoners. Gen. Davidson
                    now raised several hundred men, and Col. Sumner and Brevard had several skirmishes with the Loyalist, in which this applicant and his company actively participated at Colson�s Mills -- about this time at a place in the western part
                    of the state (N.C.) the tories had collected to a great number and we marched against them and at Colson�s Mills. This was in the Month of May 1780, as well as this applicant recollects. He recollects well that it was just before or
                    about the time of Gates� defeat at Camden. During this winter and fall this applicants company abandoned his district of protection and under Col. Davie and Gen. Davidson opposed the passage of Lord Cornwallias through North Carolina.
                    At the time of the approach of Cornwallias to Charlotte under Col. Davie the troops posted&nbsp; themselves to meet the enemy. On the enemys approach the companies commanded by this applicant received the first onset from Tarleton�s
                    Calvallry, and the firing became general on this on the left wing, the troops were commanded by Col. Davie in person and for three times we succeeded in repulsing the enemy. At length we had to yield to superior numbers. In this battle
                    we had many men killed several from under this applicant. In December just before Christmas Gen. Nathaniel Greene from the North took command of us all this was in 1780. We all by his proclamation and the order of our governor was
                    placed under his command and assembled at Charlotte, from there this applicant was placed under Col. Washington and marched to S. Carolina to Augusta and Ninety Six. After marching in a southern direction for several days news came,
                    that Tarleton was after us. We were all now under Gen. Morgan, and a terrible conflict ensued at the Cowpens between Tarleton�s men and the army under Gen. Morgan, at the Cowpens. Here the Americans was victorious and took a great
                    many military stores, cannons, baggage, and six or seven hundred British and Tory prisoners. This was in January 1781 it was cold weather but inclined to be rainy during the battle. The company which belonged to this applicant was
                    placed under Col. Howard on the extreme right of the division and this applicants commanded under a company in the center. Our company when just about to catch up our horses which was hid about four hundred paces in the rear of the
                    line of battle, fell upon us with great fury but we were fortunately relieved by Washington�s Leegion that hastened to our assistance. After this engagement we all formed a junction with Gen. Greene and retreated with him to Dan and
                    crossed over into Virginia and remaining there but a short period and marched back to Guilford Court House and this applicant actively participated in the memorable battle and he had the great mortification to see his men in a panic
                    fly at the approach of the enemy, and although this applicant endeavored to rally them, it was impossible and many even retreated to their homes. But this applicant remained and continued to fight until the Americans was thrown into
                    disorder & confusion and defeated. At this time or in a few days afterwards, this applicant being unwell and his company broken obtained respite for a while, which was granted him. He remained at home and did not go with General Greene
                    to Ninety Six, during this summer he did all he could to get his company to assemble, there cry was no pay and thier families required them at home. He then went from Guilford over to Virginia, and in September 1781 he raised a small
                    volunteer company for three months to join Gen. Washington at Little York. Little York was however taken before this applicant arrived. He knew a great many Continental officers and Regiments, and Militia officers during his service.
                    In the month of October the term of service of the Company from Montogmery County, Virginia just mentioned, expiring he gave them their discharge and he himself returned to NC where he received the thanks of the Governor and a Certificate
                    stating his services. This applicant knew Gen. Smallwood, Gen. Davidson, Gen. Rutherford, Gen. Pickens, Gen. Sumner, Gen. Otho Williams, Col. Cleveland, Col. Lyttle, Col. William Washington, Col. Malnady?/Malmody, Col. Lee, (from Virginia)
                    General Goodwin, Col. Howard who commanded the 3rd Maryland Regiment, Captain Holgin. Col Paiseley, John Williams, the Baron BeKalb, Col. Brevard. And many other Continental and Militia officers that I have forgotten. I have no documentary
                    evidence in my favor having forwarded my commission about six years ago by General Alexander Lackey to the War department who sent it on by mail it has never been returned to this applicant. He received a letter from the Secretary
                    of War informing him that as he was not a regular he could not be allowed, his commission was from the Governor of the N. Carolina. He has made search and enquiring for it for some time, and he believes that the same is now lost or
