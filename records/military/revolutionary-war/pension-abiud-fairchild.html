      Pension Application of Abiud Fairchild, Revolutionary War Submitted by <a href="mailto:bmulthup@erinet.com">Marilee Spradlin Multhup</a> State of Kentucky&nbsp; County of Floyd On this 18th day of February, 1834, personally appeared in open court before the Justices of Floyd County now sitting Abiud Fairchild, a resident of Kentucky, in the county of Floyd, aged seventy-one years, who being first duly sworn according to law, doth on his oath make the following declaration in order to obtain the benefit of provision made by the act of Congress of the 7th of June, 1832. That he entered the service of the United States under the following named officers and served as herein stated. He resided in Wilkes County, in the State of North Carolina, when he first entered the service as a drafted soldier on or about the 10th day of October, in the year 1778, in a company of North Carolina Militia of which John Robbins had been appointed Captain. He met his company at Wilkesborough, in Wilkes County, North Carolina, and Captain Robbins not joining us, William Gillery, the Lieutenant of the company, took the command and commanded the company throughout the whole tour. William Sutton, the Ensign, acted as Lieutenant, and the Sergeant, whose name, to the best of his recollection, was James Lewis, acted as Ensign. From Wilkesborough we marched down to Salisbury, in Rowan County, North Carolina, where we lay three or four days, and then marched out to the town of Charlotte, in Mecklenberg County, where we did no halt, but marched directly on to Camden in South Carolina, where we halted and staid about a week. From Camden we marched across Santee River at Nelson's Ferry, at the mouth of Eutaw Spring Branch. At Nelson's Ferry, where we lay one night only, we took the right-handed road and marched on to Dorchester and came near to Perosburg, the headquarters of the North Carolina troops. The South Carolina troops were there when we arrived. We encamped about a half mile from the town where we remained about six weeks. Colonel John Brevard was the commanding Colonel of the regiment to which his company belonged. From the encampment near Perosburg, we marched up the Savannah River to the Three Sisters, were we staid but a short time, when Captain Gillery and his company left the other troops and we marched down the river about three miles to a place called the White House, where we went as garrison to guard a ferry on the Savannah River. But a few days after, his company left the Three Sisters. General Lincoln having under his command about six thousand regulars (as he, this applicant, was informed) came on to the Three Sisters and remained there but a few days. During our stay at the White House, Colonel Syms having under his command about two hundred Light Horse troops, came there, and encamped with us one night, and next morning left us. Every morning during our stay at the White House a Corporal and six men were sent to the ferry as sentinels where they remained until they were relieved by another Corporal and six men more. After remaining at the White House, to the best of his recollection, about six weeks, his company was marched around a swamp call the Black Swamp, lying near the river, to a place called the Turkey Hill, where the company discharged, on the 10th of April, 1779. His discharge was signed by Captain or Lieutenant William Gillery. From the 10th of April, 1779 to the 1st of June, 1780, he was out as a volunteer on short excursions, receiving orders from Colonel Benjamin Cleveland, in what direction to proceed in pursuit of the Tories, and if the Tories should be to strong, to return and give information to the Colonel so that he could go or send a force sufficient to take them. In these he was accompanied, generally, by ten, fifteen, or twenty men detached from the men under Colonel Cleveland. In excursions of this kind and sometimes in service under Colonel Cleveland, with the other troops of the regiment, he was in service a few days over twelve months between the 10th of April, 1779, and the first of June, 1780, in the counties of Wilkes, Burke, and Rutherford, but mostly Burke. In the last of June or the first of July, 1780 he went as a volunteer and joined Colonel Cleveland at Wilkesborough, in Wilkes County, North Carolina. He was placed in a company by Colonel Cleveland, the names of none of the officers of which he can recollect. Colonel Cleveland had under his command about two hundred men. We marched on to Ramsour's about ten o'clock, A.M., the day of the month not recollected but he thinks it was between the 5th and 10th of July, 1780. When we arrived the battle between Mecklenberg troops and the Tories was over, and the Tories had been defeated. He then understood that in this battle about one hundred Tories were slain and two hundred taken prisoners. From Ramsour's he returned home to his residence, in Wilkes County, having been in service about two weeks. He next went into the service as a volunteer in a company of which William Jackson was Captain. The names of the other company officers he does not now recollect. Colonel Benjamin Cleveland was his commanding Colonel. He joined his company at Wilkesborough, in Wilkes County, on or about the 1st day of September, 1780. From Wilkesborough we marched on to Krider's Fort, in Burke County, North Carolina, where we remained two or three weeks, and then marched up and crossed the Catawba River at Greenleaf Ford, near Morgantown. From there we marched to the head of Cane Creek, a branch of Little Broad River. Between Greenleaf Ford and the head of Cane Creek we fell in with the Virginia troops under command of Colonel Campbell. From here we marched to Colonel Walker's old place (then so called) on Little Broad River, and halted but a very short time, when Colonel Campbell, whose troops were all horsemen, and Colonel Cleveland, after raising all the horses he could, marched on with what mounted soldiers there were, and left the footmen, about one hundred in number, to follow on with all possible expedition. From Colonel Walker's old place, he, this applicant, marched on under command of Captain William Jackson, and crossed Broad River and went down by Buck Creek and passed a place called the Cowpens. We then passed down Buck Creek some distance and left Buck Creek and crossed Broad River again at Cherokee Ford. We then marched on to King's Mountain-arrived the next day after the battle, a little after dark, at the encampment of the American forces, about two miles from the battle ground. Colonel Ferguson, the commander of the British troops at King's Mountain, was killed and the troops under his command defeated, and, to the best of his recollection, about - hundred of them taken prisoners. The battle was fought, to best of his recollection, on the 4th or 5th of October, 1780. From King's Mountain we marched back to Colonel Walker's old place and then turned back towards King's Mountain again, to Vickerstaff where we remained about two days. Here ten Tory prisoners were sentenced to be hanged. Nine of them were accordingly executed, and the other escaped. From Vickerstaff we again marched to Colonel Walker's old place. Here this applicant and six or seven other soldiers were left with directions from Colonel Cleveland to bring on a wagon which he had taken at the battle of King's Mountain, and the other troops marched on and left us. We went on towards Wilkes County, and on Cane Creek we met four or five men sent back to assist us with the wagon. We then went on to Wilkes County with the wagon, and he received a discharge signed by Captain Jackson for a three month's tour. The time when he received this discharge he does not recollect, but he is able to state positively that he was in service three months on this tour. He next went out as a volunteer under John Cleveland, a young man, the son of Colonel Cleveland, who commanded as Captain. He met the company at Wilkesborough on or about the 3rd of March, 1781, and we then marched down (there being about forty of us under Captain Cleveland) to the old Trading Fort on the Yadkin River, in Rowan, and returned from this expedition about the 25th of April, 1781, and received no written discharge, to the best of his recollection. He has no documentary evidence, and knows of no person whose testimony he can procure who can testify as to his services. Sworn to and subscribed the day and year aforesaid.

Did you ever receive a discharge from the service, and if so, by whom was it signed, and what has become of it? Ans. I never received but two discharges that I recollect of.
