                            <h3>Religion's Role in Eastern Kentucky</h3>
                            <p>Religion plays an important role in the lives of early Kentucky settlers and continues to
                                play an important role today. Some of the earliest records are not only from the local
                                governments but also from the churchs. While there are many church communities in the
                                area, the New Salem Association has left many records.</p>
                            <p>In 1825, the New Salem Association of the Old Regular Baptist was established in Eastern
                                Kentucky. The New Salem Baptist Church in Harold (of Floyd County) was one of the
                                original churches to enter the New Salem Association of Baptists. They built the New
                                Salem Baptist Church in Harold Gap (now called Old Harold Road).</p>
                            <p> According to records from August 1825, the first messengers were Simeon Justice
                                (Moderator), Alexander Lackey (Clerk of the Association), and William Salisbury.
                                Throughout the years, the association changed names (Regular United, Regular Primitive,
                                Regular Baptist and Old Regular). Today, the association is called the New Salem
                                Association of Old Regular Baptist of Jesus Christ. They refer to the member churches as
                                Old Regular Baptists. </p>
                            <h2>Old Regular Baptist Records</h2>
                            <p>The New Salem Association began keeping minutes on a regular basis in 1895. These mintues
                                contained obituaries and memorials. Some of these obituaries were published years after
                                the person had died. The following list contains links to the minutes, newsletters, and
                                various manuscripts.</p>
