							<p>Religion plays an important role in the lives of early Kentucky settlers and continues to play
								an important role today. Some of the earliest records are not only from the local governments
								but also from the churchs. While there are many church communities in the area, the New Salem
								Association has left many records.</p>
							<p>In 1825, the New Salem Association of the Old Regular Baptist was established in Eastern
								Kentucky. The New Salem Baptist Church in Harold (of Floyd County) was one of the original
								churches to enter the New Salem Association of Baptists. They built the New Salem Baptist Church
								in Harold Gap (now called Old Harold Road).</p>
							<p> According to records from August 1825, the first messengers were Simeon Justice (Moderator),
								Alexander Lackey (Clerk of the Association), and William Salisbury. Throughout the years, the
								association changed names (Regular United, Regular Primitive, Regular Baptist and Old Regular).
								Today, the association is called the New Salem Association of Old Regular Baptist of Jesus
								Christ. They refer to the member churches as Old Regular Baptists. </p>
							<h2>Old Regular Baptist Records</h2>
							<p>The New Salem Association began keeping minutes on a regular basis in 1895. These mintues
								contained obituaries and memorials. Some of these obituaries were published years after the
								person had died. The following list contains links to the minutes, newsletters, and various
								manuscripts.</p>
