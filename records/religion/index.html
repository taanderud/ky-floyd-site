	<h1>Religion</h1>
	<p>Religion plays an important role in the lives of early Kentucky settlers and continues to play an important role
		today. Some of the earliest records are not only from the local governments but also from the churchs. While there
		are many church communities in the area, the New Salem Association has left many records.</p>
	<p>In 1825, the New Salem Association of the Old Regular Baptist was established in Eastern Kentucky. The New Salem
		Baptist Church in Harold (of Floyd County) was one of the original churches to enter the New Salem Association of
		Baptists. They built the New Salem Baptist Church in Harold Gap (now called Old Harold Road).</p>
	<p> According to records from August 1825, the first messengers were Simeon Justice (Moderator), Alexander Lackey
		(Clerk of the Association), and William Salisbury. Throughout the years, the association changed names (Regular
		United, Regular Primitive, Regular Baptist and Old Regular). Today, the association is called the New Salem
		Association of Old Regular Baptist of Jesus Christ. They refer to the member churches as Old Regular Baptists. </p>
	<h2>Old Regular Baptist Records</h2>
	<p>The New Salem Association began keeping minutes on a regular basis in 1895. These mintues contained obituaries and
		memorials. Some of these obituaries were published years after the person had died. The following list contains
		links to the minutes, newsletters, and various manuscripts.</p>
