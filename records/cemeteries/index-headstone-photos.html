        <p>This is a photo of the headstone of my gr-gr-gr grandfather and grandmother Solomon and Jennie Stratton taken by my gr-grandfather in 1941.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't know the location of the cemetery other than Floyd County.&nbsp; The Photo was taken
          on a trip he took, with some of his brothers, to look into a matter of their presumed inheritance.&nbsp; A relative of Jennie's sister wrote to me about the photo and told me there was a cemetery on a hillside at Betsy Layne on the 'Layne Plantation'
          &nbsp;where many of the Stratton, Layne and Tandy families were buried.&nbsp; This information came to her from Henry Scalf who was the editor of the East Kentuckian. Submitted By: <a href="mailto:sgbennett917@frontier.com">Susan Bennett</a></p>

        cemetery. The Hubbard-Burchett Cemetery is located on the land that William owned in the 1800's. William was the son of William Hubbard, Sr. and Frances Jackson. He was married to Sarah Hammons, daughter of James and Stacy Broughton Hammons. <p>Berkeley
          Walker was the son of Fred W. Walker and Thoba Burchett Walker. His siblings were Denman Walker, Conley Walker and Oneida Walker. Conley also died young, got shot in the stomach by a friend, it was an accident. I don't know where his headstone is, he was
          about 20 years old. Denman and Oneida never married. So no issue. The Fred W. Walker branch stops here.</p>

        THE FAMILY FARM AND WAS MOVED BECAUSE OF HWY 23 CONSTRUCTION.&nbsp; HE NOW RESTS IN HIGHLAND MEMORIAL CEMETERY AT SOUTH POINT, LAWRENCE COUNTY, OHIO <p>FIGHT OCCURRED AFTER CHURCH SERVICE AT CHAPEL</p>
        <p>A double tragedy costing the lives of two young men, occurred last night when Edmond Cyrus and William Hall met on the steps of the small church at Durbin. A small com- muntiy about ten miles back of Catlettsburg and opened fire on each other with
          revolvers. Both men were fatally injured in the fusilade and died shortly after being brought to the Ashland General Hospital about ten o'clock. The trouble dates back several months, according to the story told by persons who know the Hall and Cyrus
          families, and grew out of a family estrangement which settled down to a personal grievance between the two young men. Cyrus was twenty- five years old, while Hall was twenty. Both were well know through that section of the county and the Cyrus family
          particularly prominent through long years of settlement in that region where the men have been farmers and stock raisers. Following the close of the services at the Cyrus Chapel, the community church of that section, one of the boys came out of the church
          and was proceeding down the steps when he met the other. The guns were out in an instant, bystanders relate, and each man emptied his weapon at the other, both falling wounded at the last of twelve shots fired. A call was sent to Kilgore and Collier in
          Catlettsburg for an ambulance and this was rushed to Savage branch where bad roads made further travel impossible. The bodies of the wound- ed men were carried to the ambulance and brought in to the hospital here. An operation was performed on Hall who
          was suffering from a bullet wound in the abdomen. Cyrus was found to have a wound in his shoulder and another in the neck. Hall's death occurred about four o'clock and the ambulance was called back almost immediately for Cyrus, who died but a few minutes
          later. The Halls came to Durbin from Beaver Creek and William Hall, the victim of the tragedy, married the daughter of Mr. And Mrs. Jesse Cyrus about one year ago. A separation eused shortly after and the bride re- turned to the home of her parents to
          live. The husband went to the home of his father, Tige Hall, at Burgess Station, a short distance above Lock- wood, on the Big Sandy. The farms were about three miles apart and the enmity between the husband and the brother of the wife grew until ended by
          the affair last night. Jesse Cyrus, father of Edmund Cyrus, was killed about two years ago when gored and trampled by a mad- dened bull in the pasture lot. Since that time the son has cared for the big farm and managed the affairs of the family. He was a
          member of the Green Hill Masonic Lodge No. 521 of Bolts Fork; and also a member of the I.O.O.F. lodge The funeral of Edmund Cyrus has been set for Wednesday morning at ten o'clock and burial will be made in the family cemetery on the farm. The services
          will be read by the Rev. C.P. Smith, pastor of Cyrus Chapel and the Masonic organization will take charge of the burial. The body of William Hall will be sent to the home at Burgess Station, where it will be held in the fa- thers home over night and then
          sent on to Floyd county by tomorrow morning's train for funeral services and burial on Beaver Creek, Wednesday.</p>

        Etty, Pike Co., KY. This stone was taken from the W.F. Tackett Cemetery where Solomon Osborne is buried close to Wm. Tackitt Sr., 1779-1851. This original stone appeared on the W. F. Tackett Cemetery [aka The Frank Tackett Cem.] sometime before the 1991
        Tackett Reunion and was standing against the tree near the Wm. Tackitt Sr. Memorial Stone. In 1995 a replacement Memorial Stone was placed in this location and the original stone was missing. The replacement stone, giving names of the children, does have
        some minor errors. We do not know who now has the original&nbsp; stone [Aug 1995]. Taken from the Tackett Assn. <a href="floyd-co/images/group-01/http://www.jps.net/jtackitt/05.pikefloydco.photos2.html">photos page</a></td>
