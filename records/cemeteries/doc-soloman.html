                    <h3>Transcription</h3>
                    <p> This day came the affiant, Edward Stratton, resident of Stanville, Kentucky and after being duly
                        sworn, deposed and makes the following statement:</p>
                    <p> That he was reared in the vicinity of the mouth of Mare Creek, Stanville, Kentucky, and that for
                        several years in his youth there was an old pioneer cemetery at the mouth of a small valley near
                        where the house stands and built by Walter Roberts and now occupied by Clifford Reynolds.</p>
                    <p> Further he deposes and says that some of the pioneer graves were legibly marked with gravestones
                        and on one of them was inscribed the name Solomon Stratton. After several years the stones were
                        removed, the land plowed and planted and the stones disappeared.</p>
                    <p> The object of this deposition is to establish where my ancestor, Solomon Stratton, was buried
                        and for no other reason.</p>
                    <p> Further the affiant sayeth not.</p>
                    <p>Given under my hand this the 14th day of Sept. 1964</p>
                    <p>(Signed) Edward Stratton</p>
                    <p>Sworn to and subscribed before me this 14th day of Sept. 1964 Witness my hand and official seal
