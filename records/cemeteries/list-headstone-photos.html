                                    cemetery other than Floyd County. <br>The photo was taken on a trip he took, with some of his brothers, to look into a matter of their presumed inheritance. A relative of Jennie's sister wrote to me about the photo
                                    and told me there was a cemetery on a hillside at Betsy Layne on the 'Layne Plantation' where many of the Stratton, Layne and Tandy families were buried. This information came to her from Henry Scalf who was the editor
                                    of the East Kentuckian. <br>Submitted By: <a href="mailto:sgbennett917@frontier.com" class="image fit">Susan Bennett</a>

                                    and POW, is buried in this cemetery. The Hubbard-Burchett Cemetery is located on the land that William owned in the 1800's. William was the son of William Hubbard, Sr. and Frances Jackson. He was married to Sarah Hammons,
                                    daughter of James and Stacy Broughton Hammons.
                                    <p>Berkeley Walker was the son of Fred W. Walker and Thoba Burchett Walker. His siblings were Denman Walker, Conley Walker and Oneida Walker. Conley also died young, got shot in the stomach by a friend, it was an accident.
                                        I don't know where his headstone is, he was about 20 years old. Denman and Oneida never married. So no issue. The Fred W. Walker branch stops here.</p>

                                    <p> FIGHT OCCURRED AFTER CHURCH SERVICE AT CHAPEL</p>
                                    <p>A double tragedy costing the lives of two young men, occurred last night when Edmond Cyrus and William Hall met on the steps of the small church at Durbin. A small com- muntiy about ten miles back of Catlettsburg and
                                        opened fire on each other with revolvers. Both men were fatally injured in the fusilade and died shortly after being brought to the Ashland General Hospital about ten o'clock. The trouble dates back several months,
                                        according to the story told by persons who know the Hall and Cyrus families, and grew out of a family estrangement which settled down to a personal grievance between the two young men. Cyrus was twenty- five years
                                        old, while Hall was twenty. Both were well know through that section of the county and the Cyrus family particularly prominent through long years of settlement in that region where the men have been farmers and
                                        stock raisers. Following the close of the services at the Cyrus Chapel, the community church of that section, one of the boys came out of the church and was proceeding down the steps when he met the other. The guns
                                        were out in an instant, bystanders relate, and each man emptied his weapon at the other, both falling wounded at the last of twelve shots fired. A call was sent to Kilgore and Collier in Catlettsburg for an ambulance
                                        and this was rushed to Savage branch where bad roads made further travel impossible. The bodies of the wound- ed men were carried to the ambulance and brought in to the hospital here. An operation was performed
                                        on Hall who was suffering from a bullet wound in the abdomen. Cyrus was found to have a wound in his shoulder and another in the neck. Hall's death occurred about four o'clock and the ambulance was called back almost
                                        immediately for Cyrus, who died but a few minutes later. The Halls came to Durbin from Beaver Creek and William Hall, the victim of the tragedy, married the daughter of Mr. And Mrs. Jesse Cyrus about one year ago.
                                        A separation eused shortly after and the bride re- turned to the home of her parents to live. The husband went to the home of his father, Tige Hall, at Burgess Station, a short distance above Lock- wood, on the
                                        Big Sandy. The farms were about three miles apart and the enmity between the husband and the brother of the wife grew until ended by the affair last night. Jesse Cyrus, father of Edmund Cyrus, was killed about two
                                        years ago when gored and trampled by a mad- dened bull in the pasture lot. Since that time the son has cared for the big farm and managed the affairs of the family. He was a member of the Green Hill Masonic Lodge
                                        No. 521 of Bolts Fork; and also a member of the I.O.O.F. lodge The funeral of Edmund Cyrus has been set for Wednesday morning at ten o'clock and burial will be made in the family cemetery on the farm. The services
                                        will be read by the Rev. C.P. Smith, pastor of Cyrus Chapel and the Masonic organization will take charge of the burial. The body of William Hall will be sent to the home at Burgess Station, where it will be held
                                        in the fa- thers home over night and then sent on to Floyd county by tomorrow morning's train for funeral services and burial on Beaver Creek, Wednesday.</p>

                                    of the late Evert Fred Johnson of Etty, Pike Co., KY. This stone was taken from the W.F. Tackett Cemetery where Solomon Osborne is buried close to Wm. Tackitt Sr., 1779-1851. This original stone appeared on the W. F.
                                    Tackett Cemetery [aka The Frank Tackett Cem.] sometime before the 1991 Tackett Reunion and was standing against the tree near the Wm. Tackitt Sr. Memorial Stone. In 1995 a replacement Memorial Stone was placed in this
                                    location and the original stone was missing. The replacement stone, giving names of the children, does have some minor errors. We do not know who now has the original stone [Aug 1995]. Taken from the Tackett Assn.
