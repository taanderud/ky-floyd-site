                                grandfather and grandmother Solomon and Jennie Stratton taken by my gr-grandfather in
                                1941. Unfortunately I don't know the location of the cemetery other than Floyd County.
                                <br>The photo was taken on a trip he took, with some of his brothers, to look into a
                                matter of their presumed inheritance. A relative of Jennie's sister wrote to me about
                                the photo and told me there was a cemetery on a hillside at Betsy Layne on the 'Layne
                                Plantation' where many of the Stratton, Layne and Tandy families were buried. This
                                information came to her from Henry Scalf who was the editor of the East Kentuckian.

                                SOUTH POINT, LAWRENCE COUNTY, OHIO <p> FIGHT OCCURRED AFTER CHURCH SERVICE AT CHAPEL</p>
                                <p>A double tragedy costing the lives of two young men, occurred last night when Edmond
                                    Cyrus and William Hall met on the steps of the small church at Durbin. A small com-
                                    muntiy about ten miles back of Catlettsburg and opened fire on each other with
                                    revolvers. Both men were fatally injured in the fusilade and died shortly after
                                    being brought to the Ashland General Hospital about ten o'clock. The trouble dates
                                    back several months, according to the story told by persons who know the Hall and
                                    Cyrus families, and grew out of a family estrangement which settled down to a
                                    personal grievance between the two young men. Cyrus was twenty- five years old,
                                    while Hall was twenty. Both were well know through that section of the county and
                                    the Cyrus family particularly prominent through long years of settlement in that
                                    region where the men have been farmers and stock raisers. Following the close of the
                                    services at the Cyrus Chapel, the community church of that section, one of the boys
                                    came out of the church and was proceeding down the steps when he met the other. The
                                    guns were out in an instant, bystanders relate, and each man emptied his weapon at
                                    the other, both falling wounded at the last of twelve shots fired. A call was sent
                                    to Kilgore and Collier in Catlettsburg for an ambulance and this was rushed to
                                    Savage branch where bad roads made further travel impossible. The bodies of the
                                    wound- ed men were carried to the ambulance and brought in to the hospital here. An
                                    operation was performed on Hall who was suffering from a bullet wound in the
                                    abdomen. Cyrus was found to have a wound in his shoulder and another in the neck.
                                    Hall's death occurred about four o'clock and the ambulance was called back almost
                                    immediately for Cyrus, who died but a few minutes later. The Halls came to Durbin
                                    from Beaver Creek and William Hall, the victim of the tragedy, married the daughter
                                    of Mr. And Mrs. Jesse Cyrus about one year ago. A separation eused shortly after and
                                    the bride re- turned to the home of her parents to live. The husband went to the
                                    home of his father, Tige Hall, at Burgess Station, a short distance above Lock-
                                    wood, on the Big Sandy. The farms were about three miles apart and the enmity
                                    between the husband and the brother of the wife grew until ended by the affair last
                                    night. Jesse Cyrus, father of Edmund Cyrus, was killed about two years ago when
                                    gored and trampled by a mad- dened bull in the pasture lot. Since that time the son
                                    has cared for the big farm and managed the affairs of the family. He was a member of
                                    the Green Hill Masonic Lodge No. 521 of Bolts Fork; and also a member of the
                                    I.O.O.F. lodge The funeral of Edmund Cyrus has been set for Wednesday morning at ten
                                    o'clock and burial will be made in the family cemetery on the farm. The services
                                    will be read by the Rev. C.P. Smith, pastor of Cyrus Chapel and the Masonic
                                    organization will take charge of the burial. The body of William Hall will be sent
                                    to the home at Burgess Station, where it will be held in the fa- thers home over
                                    night and then sent on to Floyd county by tomorrow morning's train for funeral
                                    services and burial on Beaver Creek, Wednesday.</p>

                            <td>This is of the original headstone for "Indian Creek" Solomon Osborne, one of the
                                earliest settlers in the Indian Creek area of Pike Co., KY. At the time this was taken
                                by Jim W. Tackitt in 1987, the stone was at the home of the late Evert Fred Johnson of
                                Etty, Pike Co., KY. This stone was taken from the W.F. Tackett Cemetery where Solomon
                                Osborne is buried close to Wm. Tackitt Sr., 1779-1851. This original stone appeared on
                                the W. F. Tackett Cemetery [aka The Frank Tackett Cem.] sometime before the 1991 Tackett
                                Reunion and was standing against the tree near the Wm. Tackitt Sr. Memorial Stone. In
                                1995 a replacement Memorial Stone was placed in this location and the original stone was
                                missing. The replacement stone, giving names of the children, does have some minor
                                errors. We do not know who now has the original stone [Aug 1995]. Taken from the Tackett
                                Assn.
