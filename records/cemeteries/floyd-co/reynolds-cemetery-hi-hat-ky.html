        and his wife in the Holliday Cemetery at Ary, Ky in Perry Co. When John asked Tolbert for Polly's hand in
        marriage, Tolbert told him O. K if he promised she would be buried with her people in Holliday Cemetery. Polly
        Tackett decorated Polly Holliday's grave each year along with some others buried there also.</p>
