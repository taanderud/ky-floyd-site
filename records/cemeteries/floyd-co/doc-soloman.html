    <h1>DEPOSITION AS TO THE BURIAL SITE OF SOLOMON STRATTON</h1>
    <p> This day came the affiant, Edward Stratton, resident of Stanville, Kentucky and after being duly sworn, deposed
        and makes the following statement:</p>
    <p> That he was reared in the vicinity of the mouth of Mare Creek, Stanville, Kentucky, and that for several years
        in his youth there was an old pioneer cemetery at the mouth of a small valley near where the house stands and
        built by Walter Roberts and now occupied by Clifford Reynolds.</p>
    <p> Further he deposes and says that some of the pioneer graves were legibly marked with gravestones and on one of
        them was inscribed the name Solomon Stratton. After several years the stones were removed, the land plowed and
        planted and the stones disappeared.</p>
    <p> The object of this deposition is to establish where my ancestor, Solomon Stratton, was buried and for no other
        reason.</p>
    <p> Further the affiant sayeth not.</p>
    <p>Given under my hand this the 14th day of Sept. 1964</p>
