    <h1>OLD RILEY�S BRANCH CEMETERY</h1>
    <p>Make a left turn off Highway 122 just east of the Bevinsville Post Office onto Riley�s Branch road. Travel 1.9
        miles up Riley�s Branch. The cemetery is on the left, just past the forks in the road (the left fork goes across
        the hill to Clear Creek). An overgrown path leads up the hill to the cemetery. I have been told this was a large
        cemetery. As a child I can remember seeing the remains of log gravehouses, and several unmarked rocks that were
        used as head and foot stones. Today, only two graves can be identified.</p>
