  <p><strong>OLD RILEY�S BRANCH CEMETERY</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Make a left turn off Highway 122 just east of the Bevinsville Post Office onto Riley�s Branch road.&nbsp; Travel 1.9 miles up Riley�s Branch.&nbsp; The cemetery is on the left, just past the forks in the road (the&nbsp; left fork goes across the hill to Clear Creek).&nbsp; An overgrown path leads up the hill to the cemetery.&nbsp; I have been told this was a large cemetery.&nbsp; As a child I can remember seeing the remains of log gravehouses,&nbsp; and several unmarked rocks that were used as head and foot stones.&nbsp; Today, only two graves can be identified.</p>
