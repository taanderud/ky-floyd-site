  <h1>Williams CEMETERY</h1>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Williams Branch - Left Fork of Abbott</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This really isn't a cemetery but just a location of two graves.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Location: Left Fork of Abbott to Williams Branch. Follow Williams Branch</p>
  <p>up the creek towards the head of the holler. When you get to the 3rd barn,</p>
  <p>there is a road to follow up, you'll reach a log barn and continue up the holler.</p>
  <p>Once you reach the 3rd flat area (where house's once were) there is a grove of</p>
  <p>pines. The graves are in there someplace.</p>

  <p><strong>Ireta Williams&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(infant of James Earl & Josephine Neeley-Williams)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Both children were probably born between 1920 - 1935</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I recently tried to locate thier graves and couldn't. I feel the recent logging</p>
  <p>of the hillside has disturbed the graves and have been bull dozed over.</p>
