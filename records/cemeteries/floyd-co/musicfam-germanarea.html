<p>Location of cemetery (Copperas Creek) The cemetery is not easily accessible because of the steep climb to get to it and because it is behind gated property and special permission must be obtained.</p>
<p>Four graves are clearly marked with headstones, but there are other stones lying flat on the ground that may mark older graves.</p>
