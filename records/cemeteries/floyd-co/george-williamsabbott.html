  <p><strong>George Williams Cemetery</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Williams Branch, Left hand fork of Abbott</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;Direcrions: Go up the head of Williams Branch until you run out of road, they you'll walk up the creek. When you reach the 3rd barn, turn to the right and follow the creek until it bends to the left. At the creek bend, continue straight and go up the small hillside out of the creek. Turn left and in just a ways you'll see the hillside where the cemetery is. It's in very bad condition and overgrown with trees and vegitation. I have personally placed the children's stones back into the ground in 2005. This cemetery is in need of care. I have photo's of the stone's if anyone's interested.</strong></p>
