            </header>
            <p>Submitted by Bob Hall</p>
            <p>As you look at this document see the entry beside March 11. This record was obtained for the Family
                Search Library in Salt Lake City, Utah via microfilm.</p>
            <p> The same roll of micro-film has Anthony Hall marrying Mary Hepple on Nov 13, 1744. It lists the birth of
                two other children to Anthony and Mary. Randall born June 9, 1748 and Thomas born May 5, 1750. All
                entries list Kirkhill Parish of Scotland as place of residence. </p>
