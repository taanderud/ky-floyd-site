                    <p>about the 1850 Census</p>
                    <p>The 1850 Perry County Census is an incomplete census as the enumerators did not visit everyone in
                        the county missing many people that should otherwise be listed in the census. At that time there
                        were no signs saying you are now entering Breathitt County so the Enumerators did not always
                        observe County lines thus you may find some of the Perry County Families in other neighboring
                        county censuses. It seems that they went to the head of small hollows and valleys and then
                        stopped regardless of where the county line may have been. Often times the enumerator did not
                        walk up a hollow but instead asked the families that lived nearby the names and ages of those
                        that lived in the hollow above them. Also many times they would count empty houses of families
                        that had already moved from the county. In short they got paid by each name or household so they
                        got as many households as possible. Most times they even counted people they met on the road as
                        in the case of James Butler and Elijah Holliday who was peddlers.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;About this page</p>
                    <p>This page was not intended to be a tran scripted copy of the 1850 census but rather an addition
                        to it with added information such as surnames of wives, corrections of mistakes the Enumerator
                        may have made and various other information that Linda felt should be added. It was typed into
                        the computer by Linda Manlove and was the result of her efforts and proofread by others. Some of
                        the names was hard to read and may vary from publication to publication depending on how
                        different person's eyes read the microfilm. And as usual some typos may exist but I have looked
                        it over several times but still after a while one's eyes goes blind to his own mistakes.</p>
                    <p>Annotations of surnames of wives were taken from Perry County Annotated Census published by the
                        Perry County Genealogical Society and from various family History Books and other sources. Keep
                        in mind they could be wrong and this is to serve as a guide only. It gives you something to
                        start with and is up to you to find the proof. Remember to search for various spellings of
                        surnames at the spelling changed from one to another over a period of time and the Enumerators
                        was not always the best spellers in the world. The three R-'s does not include spelling.</p>
