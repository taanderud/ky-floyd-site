                            <p>Many early residents of Floyd County arrived with the dream of owning their own land. As
                                part of the Revolutionary War, the veterans were promised land if they were willing to
                                settle it. You can learn more about this process in the first chapter of the <a

                            <p>Before an individual dies, he or she writes a will to direct what should happen to their
                                belongs after they have died. Once the person passes, the will enters the probate
                                process with the court system. This process ensures the will is executed and all affairs
                                are settled. If a person dies without a will, his or her estate still must be settled.
                                For instance, any under age children might be appointed a legal guardian by the court
                                system. </p>
