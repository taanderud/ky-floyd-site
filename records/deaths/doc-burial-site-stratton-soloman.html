    <h1>Deposition as to The Burial Site of Solomon Stratton</h1>
    <p>This day came the affiant, Edward Stratton, resident of Stanville, Kentucky and after being duly sworn, deposes and makes the following statement:</p>
    <p>That he was reared in the vicinity of the mouth of Mare Creek, Stanville, Kentucky, and that for several years in his youth there was an old pioneer cemetery at the mouth of a small valley near where the house stands and built by Walter Roberts and
        now occupied by Clifford Reynolds. Further he deposes and says that some of the pioneer graves were legibly marked with gravestones and on one of them was inscribed the name Solomon Stratton. After several years the stones were removed, the land
        plowed and planted and the stones disappeared. The object of this deposition is to establish where my ancestor, Solomon Stratton, was buried and for no other reason. Further the affiant sayeth not.</p>
