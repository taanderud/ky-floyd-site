          <p>This day came the affiant, Edward Stratton, resident of Stanville, Kentucky and after being duly sworn,
            deposes and makes the following statement:</p>
          <p>That he was reared in the vicinity of the mouth of Mare Creek, Stanville, Kentucky, and that for several
            years in his youth there was an old pioneer cemetery at the mouth of a small valley near where the house
            stands and built by Walter Roberts and now occupied by Clifford Reynolds. Further he deposes and says that
            some of the pioneer graves were legibly marked with gravestones and on one of them was inscribed the name
            Solomon Stratton. After several years the stones were removed, the land plowed and planted and the stones
            disappeared. The object of this deposition is to establish where my ancestor, Solomon Stratton, was buried
            and for no other reason. Further the affiant sayeth not.</p>
          <p>Given under my hand this the 14th day of Sept. 1964</p>
          <p>(Signed) Edward Stratton</p>
