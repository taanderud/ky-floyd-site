  <p><br></p>
  <p>Maj. Hoddard Johnson</p>
  <p>and</p>
  <p>Dept. of KY. and East Tenn.</p>
  <p>I would respectfully ask permission to visit my home in North Eastern KY. for the following reasons. The enemy who made a recent raid on this part of the country on returning paid my family a visit and literally distroyed anything the had accumalated to live upon for the winter, I am a poor man and no one left at my home except my wife + some little children who are not large enough to aid or assist her. She is destitute of means by which she might procure something to live upon. The enemy not only distroyed grain, but took nearly all my household. I can by returning afford them clothing and when I get home can procure supplies-- I will rejoin my command within (30) thirty days. I live at Floyd County KY. a distance of about (30) thirty miles.</p>
  <p>Hoping that the leave I ask may be granted.</p>
  <p>I am your most Obedient Servant</p>
  <p>William J. Hall Captain</p>
