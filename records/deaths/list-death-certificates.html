              <strong>Arminta Butler</strong>
              <p>BUTLER: George Herrell, Arte c/f Robert &amp; Lucinda Herrell Aug 23 1825</p>
              <p>You have the following information on your marriage consent page. In fact the marriage consent is for an Arte Herrell, however, I have a copy of the original copy of the consent and it states that Robert Herrell is the step-father of Arte. As it
                turns out, Arte is a younger sister to Lucinda Turman Herrell. Both Lucinda and Arte are daughters of John Turman and Rachel Jones. When John Turman and Rachel Jones moved to Lawrence County, Kentucky, Arte stayed behind with her older sister who
                was by that time married.</p>
              <p>Further evidence of Arte being a Turman is on her daughter's death certificate. She had a daughter who never married named Arminta Butler on 11/20/1845 in Staffordsville, Johnson County, KY. Arminta died on 1 May 1939 in Staffordsville. The
                informant was Colfax Butler, Arminta's Nephew and grandson of Arte. He clearly identified that Arminta's mother was in fact, Artie Turman. I had always suspected that she was a Turman until I got her daughter's death certificate. Arminta's death
                certificate can be found attached. I thought you would like to update the consents to reflect this new information. There is a lot of confusion out there over this ancestry. Thank you for your help.</p>
