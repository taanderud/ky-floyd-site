                                    <strong>Arminta Butler</strong>
                                <p>BUTLER: George Herrell, Arte c/f Robert &amp; Lucinda Herrell Aug 23 1825</p>
                                <p>You have the following information on your marriage consent page. In fact the
                                    marriage consent is for an Arte Herrell, however, I have a copy of the original copy
                                    of the consent and it states that Robert Herrell is the step-father of Arte. As it
                                    turns out, Arte is a younger sister to Lucinda Turman Herrell. Both Lucinda and Arte
                                    are daughters of John Turman and Rachel Jones. When John Turman and Rachel Jones
                                    moved to Lawrence County, Kentucky, Arte stayed behind with her older sister who was
                                    by that time married.</p>
                                <p>Further evidence of Arte being a Turman is on her daughter's death certificate. She
                                    had a daughter who never married named Arminta Butler on 11/20/1845 in
                                    Staffordsville, Johnson County, KY. Arminta died on 1 May 1939 in Staffordsville.
                                    The informant was Colfax Butler, Arminta's Nephew and grandson of Arte. He clearly
                                    identified that Arminta's mother was in fact, Artie Turman. I had always suspected
                                    that she was a Turman until I got her daughter's death certificate. Arminta's death
                                    certificate can be found attached. I thought you would like to update the consents
                                    to reflect this new information. There is a lot of confusion out there over this
                                    ancestry. Thank you for your help.</p>
