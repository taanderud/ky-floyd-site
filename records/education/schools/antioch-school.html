                    <p>Here is a photo of my grandmothers class photo. She thinks it was called Antioch and was in Floyd
                        county. She is the only one identified in the photo. She is the second from the left in the
                        second row not the girl standing behind her. Feel free to place it on the website. I may also
                        send it to the Kentucky Explorer magazine. My grandmothers name was Betty Johnson and is now
                        Betty Tackett. Maybe someone will recognize this photo. </p>
