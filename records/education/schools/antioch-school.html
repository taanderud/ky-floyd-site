    <p>Here is a photo of my grandmothers class photo. She thinks it was called Antioch and was in Floyd county. She is the only one identified in the photo. She is the second from the left in the second row not the girl standing behind her. Feel free to
        place it on the website. I may also send it to the Kentucky Explorer magazine. My grandmothers name was Betty Johnson and is now Betty Tackett. Maybe someone will recognize this photo. </p>
