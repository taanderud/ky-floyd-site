                    <p>This photo is my grandmother's class. She thinks it was called Antioch and was in Floyd County.
                        She is the only one identified in the photo. She is the second from the left in the second row
                        not the girl standing behind her. My grandmothers name was Betty Johnson and is now Betty
                        Tackett. Maybe someone will recognize this photo. </p>
