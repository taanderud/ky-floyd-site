    <p>My name is Heather Pack Howell.&nbsp; I am responding to your request for information about the people in </p>
    the Salisbury School picture.&nbsp; I believe that the woman to the far right is my great-grandmother, Ida Stumbo Williams, who was a teacher at the school. <i>Heather Howell</i>. </p>
