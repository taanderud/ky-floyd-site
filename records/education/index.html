              <h3>School Systems</h3>
              <p>Educational institutions, such as grade schools, high schools, and universities, create records
                routinely. These records include lists of students and a yearly photo. School yearbooks with photos of
                the students and faculty are most widely available publically. These yearbooks can be found online, in
                libraries, or historical societies.</p>
              <p>Floyd County has a school system that oversees education for citizens. </p>
