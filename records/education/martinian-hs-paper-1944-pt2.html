          <h3>Athletic Code:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I shall consider my athletic opponents as my guests.</li>
            <li>I will always cheer the opposing team when t appears upon the floor.</li>
            <li>I will clap for the opponent who makes a good play.</li>
            <li>I will remain quiet while opponents are making free throws.</li>
            <li>I will not cheer when opponents are penalized.</li>
            <li>I will cheer an opponent who is injured in the game.</li>
            <li>I willgive the opponent a yell after the game.</li>
            <li>I will never deride any official.</li>
            <li>I will be courteous to all visitors.</li>
            <li>I believe that good sportsmanship means the application of the Golden Rule. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now ball season is in full swing and Martin has won our first game of the year. We beat Maytown with a
            score of 24-17. Of course we all know this wasn't much of a lead over Maytown but we have to give our boys a
            chance. They are just getting warmed up. But to have a good team they have to have someoe behind them
            pulling and backing them up. Quite a few people from Martin attended the Mayown gamebut manyfailed to sit
            with the cheering section. Yes, we know you are glad when our boys make the points, but do the boys know it?
            The only way they can tell is for us to yell and yell our heads off for them. So please, let's all get
            together and support Martin at all her games, if possible. On Wednesday, November 15, the Martin Purple
            Flash gave the Wheelwright boys a merry chase. At half the score was 27-1, in favor of Martin. In the end
            Martin left them way behind with a score of 49-8. John Wohlford was high-point man with 17 points; Burns
            Ratliffe, 12 points; Charles Crum, 9 points; T.J. Prater, 9 points; and Roy Ratliffe, 2 points. Now that you
            all see how much good a arge crowd does for the boys, please keep it up. </p>
          <p>The basic ideal of all games be great or small is the sportmanship that grows out of them. The Greeks were
            the first people who valued physical development highly. They ran races, threw the discus, and the javelin
            in the Olympic games. The only reward the victor received was a wreath of olive leaves. He was praised by
            the poets and statues of him were erected throughout the land.</p>
          <p>The members of our basketball team will strive to win games and also receive the esteem of our opponents
            and spectators. We know that a basket ball game just lasts a few minutes while the game of life goes on till
            we meet the inevitable. Some of the great men in our times, who are leaders in he military, social and
            political world, are former athletes. It has been said that many of England's battles were won on the
            athletic fields of Eton. We have worked out a creed for the year which we are going to follow:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>We are boosters, not "gripers".</li>
            <li>Cooperation--a very simple word but necessary for success.</li>
            <li>Play to win the game but be clean.</li>
          </ol>
