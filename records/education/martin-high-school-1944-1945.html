        <p>Athletic Code:</p>
        <p>I shall consider my athletic opponents as my guests.</p>
        <p>I will always cheer the opposing team when t appears upon the floor.</p>
        <p>I will clap for the opponent who makes a good play.</p>
        <p>I will remain quiet while opponents are making free throws.</p>
        <p>I will not cheer when opponents are penalized.</p>
        <p>I will cheer an opponent who is injured in the game.</p>
        <p>I willgive the opponent a yell after the game.</p>
        <p>I will never deride any official.</p>
        <p>I will be courteous to all visitors.</p>
        <p>I believe that good sportsmanship means the application of the Golden Rule. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now ball season is in full swing and Martin has won our first game of the year.&nbsp; We beat Maytown with a
          score of 24-17.&nbsp; Of course we all know this wasn't much of a lead over Maytown but we have to give our
          boys a chance.&nbsp; They are just getting warmed up.&nbsp; But to have a good team they have to have someoe
          behind them pulling and backing them up.&nbsp; Quite a few people from Martin attended the Mayown gamebut
          manyfailed to sit with the cheering section.&nbsp; Yes, we know you are glad when our boys make the points,
          but do the boys know it?&nbsp; The only way they can tell is for us to yell and yell our heads off for
          them.&nbsp; So please, let's all get together and support Martin at all her games, if possible. &nbsp; On
          Wednesday, November 15, the Martin Purple Flash gave the Wheelwright boys a merry chase.&nbsp; At half the
          score was 27-1, in favor of Martin.&nbsp; In the end Martin left them way behind with a score of 49-8.&nbsp;
          John Wohlford was high-point man with 17 points; Burns Ratliffe, 12 points; Charles Crum, 9 points; T.J.
          Prater, 9 points; and Roy Ratliffe, 2 points.&nbsp; Now that you all see how much good a arge crowd does for
          the boys, please keep it up. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>The basic ideal of all games be great or small is the sportmanship that grows out of them.&nbsp; The Greeks
          were the first people who valued physical development highly.&nbsp; They ran races, threw the discus, and the
          javelin in the Olympic games.&nbsp; The only reward the victor received was a wreath of olive leaves.&nbsp; He
          was praised by the poets and statues of him were erected throughout the land.</p>
        <p>The members of our basket ball team will syrive to win games and also receive the esteem of our opponents and
          spectators.&nbsp; We know that a basket ball game just lasts a few minutes while the game of life goes on till
          we meet the inevitable.&nbsp; Some of the great men in our times, who are leaders in he military, social and
          political world, are former athletes.&nbsp; It has been said that many of England's battles were won on the
          athletic fields of Eton.&nbsp; We have worked out a creed for the year which we are going to follow:</p>
        <p>1. We are boosters, not "gripers".</p>
        <p>2. Cooperation--a very simple word but necessary for success.</p>
        <p>3. Play to win the game but be clean.</p>
