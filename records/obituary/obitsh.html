                    Bainbridge, Ohio, she was the daughter of the late Cleo Clifford and Lena Strader Cast. She lived in Hueysville, until July 2002, where she was a member of the Hueysville Church of Christ.&nbsp; rene grew up in Wilmington, Ohio, graduating
                    as an honor student of Wilmington High School in 1934. She met Rondal while he was attending Wilmington College, and married him in 1937. In 1941, they moved to Hueysville, along with their first daughter, and there, three more daughters
                    were born. She became Postmaster at Hueysville in 1951, and retired in 1981. In 1965, she wrote and published the highly popular cookbook, �What�s Cooking in Kentucky� to re-roof the Hueysville Church of Christ, and buy a church bus.
                    Two years later the church leaders asked her to resume control of the cookbook, but she continued to give much of the profits to the church. When the original two-and-a-half-story church, which was uninsured, burned in 1981, she wrote
                    hundreds of letters, and made many phone calls, soliciting donations to help rebuild the church. Later projects included raising money to buy the carillon chimes and stained glass windows for the church. In 1984 she published her second
                    cookbook, �What�s Cooking for the Holidays.� Irene�s lifelong service to others included supplying food, shelter, clothing, shoes, Christmas toys, medicine, and transportation for medical care. She was always an advocate for better
                    education and the protection of children, at times, personally intervening on their behalf. She spent many hours helping distribute flood-relief items for the Red Cross, and petitioning officials about repairing roadways and bridges,
                    or clearing waterways to prevent flooding. She wrote numerous letters to congressmen, such as Carl Perkins, on behalf of those who needed aid. Her later years were spent encouraging people to come to church. She is survived by four
