                    <p><strong>SISTER ZELLA HICKS <a href="images/1953/zella-hicks-orb.jpg">[View Image]</a></strong> By
                        request of the Hicks family, I will write a short sketch of the life of Sister Zella Hicks, the
                        daughter of Jim and Martha Collins. She was born March 4, 1894-deceased September 12, 1952,
                        making her stay 58 years, 6 months and 8 days. Sister Zellie was married to Elie Hicks in the
                        year of 1910 and unto this union were born 8 children. One preceded her in death, leaving 7
                        children, 23 grandchildren, 1 great-grand-child, her husband, 4 brothers, 2 sisters and a
                        blessed old mother to mourn her loss. But, I feel our loss is her Heavenly gain. Sister joined
                        the Church of Old Regular Baptists of Jesus Christ and was baptized July 3, 1921 by Elder J. C.
                        Mosley and A L. Allen and took her membership with the Steels Creek Church and was faithful
                        until death. Sister had a hard time raising her family, but with all the hardships and
                        sicknesses she bore them with patience. Many a day, beside Brother Elie she helped in the corn
                        field hoeing corn to help and have bread for their children and to spare her friends that came
                        to their home. But the last few years sister was sick with high-blood pressure. When she got so
                        bad off Brother Elie and the children started to the hospital and she told them she would not
                        come back with them, but had a better home to go to and not to worry about her, but meet her in
                        Heaven where she won't be sick with no more heartaches and pains to bear. On that sad evening
                        while the family all was standing by in the hospital when the Pail Horse and his Rider came,
                        after they done all they could do, they had to step back and see Mother go. But. oh those last
                        words were so sweet when she clapped her hands and said, "Glory, Glory, I am going home now." So
                        God bless sister Zellie's family. Since she's been gone one daughter and two daughter-in-laws
                        have professed a hope in Christ. I want to say to the rest of the family, remember what you
                        promised your mother. for it is better not to vow than to vow and not pay for the promises you
                        made is on your record for the ,good Lord heard your promises and now, what are you going to do
                        about it? "Except a Man Be Born Again, He cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven." -I believe that is
                        where Mother is, so children be good to Brother Elie, for you will miss him when he is gone. I
                        believe I will meet Sister Zellie again. She was so glad that I was Moderator of our home church
                        and I asked her many times about her hope and she would say there was nothing in her way, so
                        children be good to one another and try to meet your mother in Heaven. So let us all strive to
                        enter in at the straight gates. This obituary is getting too long, so may God bless his family
                        that they will all repent before it is too late.</p>

                    <p><strong>BETTY BRYANT&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;At the request of the family, I will try in my weakness to write an obituary of Betty
                        Bryant. She was the daughter of Jerry Little and Sally Tackett Little, born September 22, 1894.
                        deceased September 11, 1953. age 59 years, 11 months and 19 days. She was married to B. H.
                        Bryant, August 5, 1915. Unto this union were born 13 children, 9 boys and four girls, 3 boys and
                        3 girls preceded-her in death leaving her husband, 6 boys and one girl. two brothers and one
                        sister, two half sisters, with a host of friends to mourn her loss. I hope according to her last
                        words, their loss is her eternal gain. The writer was very well acquaint- ed with Betty. I
                        remember over three years before her death she got my wife to make her a dress to be baptized
                        in. So the car that was to take her to Long Fork failed to come after her for some cause, best
                        known with the good Lord. She never did attach herself to any church, but if her hope was real,
                        it was Christ. Just a few words to the children, now that your mother is gone and never can come
                        Hack to you. So be g; ca end bind to each other and try to meet mother in that upper and better
                        world.</p>

                    <p>It is with much sadness I try to write an obituary of a dear father, who was so dear and near to
                        me. James Tackitt, son of Abel Tackitt and Rebecca Caudill Tackitt, was born October 29, 1860,
                        departed this life February 28. 1953, age 92 years and four months old. He was married to Mary
                        Ann Martin, October 2, 1879. Unto this union were born nine children, five girls and four boys.
                        Mother and one girl anal two boys preceded him in death, leaving four girls and two boys, 49
                        grand children, 186 great grandchildren, 36 great great grandchildren. One brother, and one
                        sister and a host of friends and relative., to mourn his loss. I believe our loss is his eternal
                        gain in T-leaven. He joined the Cold Regular Baptist Church in 1888 and was in the organization
                        of the Enterprise Church in 1889. He was ordained a Deacon shortly after the church was
                        organized and remained a Deacon as long as he lived. He was faithful to his duty as long as he
                        was able to go. He took sick in the church house at the June meeting in 1951 and lived till
                        February 2.8&gt; 1953, but never got able to go to the church house anymore. There was something
                        in him that taught him when his meeting time was. He would say, I would like to be at church
                        today. We called some preachers to his home and had meeting for him. He enjoyed it, but he
                        wanted to go back to the old church house where he could sit in love and fellowship with his
                        brothers, and sisters. Oh, we miss him in the church house. He was so faithful to go to all the
                        churches around and help out in every way he could. We miss him in our homes where he would so
                        often come. We miss him in his home where. he lived so long. I know Sister Minda misses him more
                        than the rest of us, because she lived with him and took care of him the last two years of his
                        life. Minda, I believe the 'Good Lord will reward you in some way for taking such good care of
                        our father. I don't think he wanted for anything if you knew it and could get it for him. Now
                        father is gone anal we know he can never come back to us, but let us be like the Psalmist David,
                        we know he never can come back to us, but by the Grace of God, we can go to where he is. I
                        believe we will see him and mother there together where there will be no more sickness or death
                        or sorrow. ,Oh, there are so many good things I could say about gather, but space will not
                        permit. Now children. grand children and great grand children you who have not made peace with
                        your Lord, it is time you were looking upward and remember the promise is to them that love and
                        serve the Lord. His funeral will be preached the fifth Saturday and Sunday in May, 19,54.
                        Everyone is invited to attend.&nbsp; </p>

                    <p>At the request of the family I will try in my weakness to write an obituary of a beloved brother
                        to-wit: Leck Keen, He was the son of Charles Keen and Polly Ann Keen. He was born March 15,
                        1888, deceased this life April 23, 1952. age 64 years, 1 month and 9 days. He was married to
                        Della Blackburn, March 10, 1912. To this union were born seven girls and one boy. One girl
                        preceded him in death, leaving six girls, one boy, and his bereaved widow. and his father
                        together with a host of friends to mourn his loss. I feel that their loss is his eternal gain.
                        Brother Keen was a crippled man but worked hard to take care of his family. Brother Keen joined
                        the Joppa Church of Old Regular Baptist June 1, Sunday 1949, baptized by Elders Jerry Hall Sr.,
                        and Troy Nickles. He lived a faithful life until death.' There is a vacant seat in the home;
                        there is also a vacant seat in the Joppa Church. A few words to the family, if you want to see
                        Brother Leck again you will have to repent of your sins and be born again. To the only boy,
                        Melvin, son be a good boy and try to meet your daddy in that upper and better world where there
                        will be no cripples or sorrow.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;With much sadness of heart I write an obituary of my dear Wife, Bessie Arnett, who was born
                        June 21, 1891 and deceased this life January 27, 1953, at the age of 62 years seven months and
                        six days. She was united in marriage to Mart Arnett on March 3rd, 1909. She and her husband were
                        closely attached all of her life. To this union were born 13 children, six boys and seven girls.
                        Four preceded her in death, 3 boys and one girl, leaving six girls and three boys and her
                        husband also 20 grand children, 7 brothers, 2 sisters and a host of friends to mourn her loss.
                        Her family surviving are Mrs. Minnie Hackworth, Mrs. Maggie Dotson, Mrs. Chairty Wiseman, Mrs.
                        Sarah Davis, Mrs. Bonnie Davis, Mrs. Grace Wiseman, Clay Arnett, Clark Arnett. Claude Arnett.
                        She was the daughter of the late John B. and Sarah Shepherd. She joined the Old Regular Baptist
                        Church in 1919, and was baptized by Elder Wm. Bill Howard and was a faithful member until death.
                        'She was loved by all her friends and neighbors and all who knew her in the Church. Her friendly
                        turn and kind ways made her many friends during her lifetime. It was her heart's delight to cook
                        and feed all her friends, and Brothers and Sisters in the Church. We all miss her. Her loss is
                        so great, but we believe our loss is her gain in heaven, with her loved ones gone on before. She
                        told everyone who talked with her while on her bed of affliction that when the Angel called her
                        home that she would meet her Savior where there would be no sorrow, pain or death.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>With a broken heart I write an obituary of my dear Mother, Mary Little. She was born March 8,
                        1867, being 86 years old at time of her death. She was married to Marion Little and unto this
                        union were born twelve children. Her husband and two children preceded her in death, ten are yet
                        living. She joined the Old Regular Baptist Church about 5(1 years ago and lived a good and
                        faithful life until February 4, 1953, when the Death Angel came to my house and took her away.
                        She lived with me about four years. Oh, how I enjoyed visiting with her and how I loved her.
                        Three days before she died she called me to her bed and said, "Marion has come after me." Mother
                        had been down and couldn't walk for four years and six months. She sure was a good mother and a
                        good wife to her husband. Oh how I miss her. She bore her sickness with patience, and believed
                        in the old time doctrine and the old fashion. ways. Three of her children followed her and
                        joined the Old Regular Baptist Church. We believe her Soul is at rest today.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>With sadness I write an obituary of my beloved sister in flesh and also in the spirit. Sister
                        Courtney Phillips was born January 27, 1868 and departed this life July 13, 1953, making her
                        stay here eighty-five (85) years. Sister Rosa Phillips was born in Dickenson County, Va., the
                        daughter of the late David and Elizabeth Huff Courtney. Sister Rosa was united in marriage with
                        the late Joseph F. Phillips in the year of 1882 and unto this union was born six daughters and
                        six sons. Two daughters and one son preceded her in death. Sister Rosa joined the Pine Grove
                        Regular Baptist Church on August, the second Saturday in 1905, and Brother George Robinson as
                        Moderator and Brother Harrison Ratliff as Clerk, when she was baptized and received into
                        fellowship of the church. (Sister Rosa's husband, the late Joseph F. Phillips preceded her in
                        death in 1943. She leaves nine children and two beloved brothers, Reverend Samuel R. Courtney,
                        Lookout, Ky., and Brother Rufus Courtney, to mourn her death. Sister Rosa, was a faithful member
                        of the Regular Baptist for sixty years. Her husband was a faithful and active member of the same
                        Church, serving as a Deacon for many years until death in 1943. I feel our loss is Heaven's
                        eternal gain. To the children --when you read this you will bethinking of Mother and the life
                        she lived. So repent, those of you who haven't, and live the life your mother lived and you can

                        brother, to-wit: Brother Henry Hall. -He was the son of Dock Hall and Jenny Hall. Brother Henry
                        Hall was born March 12, 1889, deceased from this life, November 9. 1952, age 62 years, 7. months
                        and 28 days. Brother Henry joined the Old Regular Baptist Church on May 6th, 1945. and lived a
                        faithful member until death. I visited with Brother Henry through his sickness and all of his
                        talk was on the good things of the Lord and he said if there was anything else liken, he would
                        like for the good Lord to reveal it to him. Brother Henry was married to Sister Florence Hall on
                        January 11, 1919, and to this union was born 8 children, 7 boys and 1 girl. One boy was killed
                        in service and one boy and one girl died while infants, leaving Sister Florence and 5 boys and
                        many friends to mourn his loss, but we believe that their loss will be his eternal gain. So I
                        want to say to Brother Henry's boys that are out in the field of sin. that I believe if you ever

                    <p>Mrs. Susie Gilbert Hall, beloved wife of Sank Hall, after 69 years and 2 days of life in this
                        world, quietly and peacefully at 2:25 o'clock A. M., Thursday, November 20, 1952, surrendered in
                        body to the last enemy-death, and sweetly passed on in spirit into the indescribable sweetness
                        of the rest that waiteth for the people of God, in the Glory World. There to rest amid the
                        eternal beauties until the redemption, and the resurrection of the body. She was the daughter of
                        John D., and Lydia Rakes Gilbert of Dickenson County, Virginia. Her birth was on November 18,
                        188'3. On August 9, 1900, she was united in marriage to Sank Hall. Unto this union were born 10
                        children. Two of these passed away, each at the age of 28. Their names were Bill and Mary Jane.
                        Surviving are the following: Steve, Pikeville, Ky.; John, Estill, Ky. ; Carl, Knoxville, Tenn.;
                        Elmer Everett and Mrs. Mlle Moore, Columbus, Ohio: Mrs. Lula Ratliff, Wheelwright, Ky. Also,
                        Earl Hall, a grandson, whom she reared, Columbus, Ohio. For 52 years, she was faithful to her
                        marriage vows. So she now leaves her dear old husband, her children, grand children and three
                        brothers: Henry, Charlie and Monroe to mourn the passing of a truly virtuous Christian wife, a
                        fine, lovable, affectionate mother, and a true, upright and tender-hearted sister. She had been
                        a member of the Regular Baptist Church for near 20 years. At the time of her passing, she had
                        her membership in the Ball's Branch Church of Regular Baptist, Mousie, Ky. Her kind, friendly,
                        Christian, neighborly disposition endeared her to everyone that knew her. The sweetness and
                        beauty of Christian, motherly virtues that adorned her life, make any words the writer has used
                        seem but feeble expressions. We think of her as one among the best of wives. and mothers we have
                        ever known. We are glad and thankful to the Lord that during the, last few years of her life she
                        was blessed to see her husband turn unto the Lord through "repentarrce toward God, and faith in
                        the Lord Jesus Christ", and, baptized into fellowship of the Ball's Branch Church. We wish she
                        could have seen all of her children do likewise. Her illness was long and distressing. Medical
                        skill could only render temporary relief. A wise and loving Providence had made provision for
                        her triumphant entrance into Glory and she entered in.</p>

                    <p>With a sad feeling and a broken heart I attempt and try to write an obituary of our dear beloved
                        father and husband, Miles Gibson, Sr. who was born on the head of Sly Branch of Right Beaver
                        Creek, March 15, 1893. The son of Ben Gibson and Aggie Jane Jones, and departed this life at his
                        home the 19th -day of May, 1953 at Langley, Ky. His stay on earth was 60 years, two months and
                        five days. He was in a--_-_d to Lucy Bradley, the daughter of Butler Bradley and Mary Collins
                        Bradley on the 11th., day of November 1511, and to this union were born seven children, five
                        boys and two girls Champ. Ishmeal Earale Russell. Miles Junior, Aggie Jane Collins, Stella Jean
                        Martin, whom he has left with our dear mother to mourn his loss. Dad has always had a hard way
                        in this life, his dear mother dying and leaving him when he was only 10 years old, to be brought
                        up by his dear old dad, Ben Gibson to whom we feel to believe, was a God fearing man and made
                        peace with His Lord. Several rears ago, he was blessed to live and see some of his children come
                        into the old church with that great hope they would all live together in peace some day We feel
                        to believe that Dad was a Christian long before he made his open confession to the church that
                        he believed that God had forgiven him of his sins. that he wanted to be baptized so him and
                        mother were baptized the same day, May 23, 1948 at the Old Providence 'Church by J. C. Mosley
                        and E. V. Hopkins and took up fellowship at the Old Bethel Church at Wilson Creek of Regular
                        Baptist. A short time later dad became ill with a bad heart, and his last few years on earth
                        were spent in going to church and reading the Bible, it seemed to do him good to see his
                        children come home as he would talk to us all and give us the best counsel. His life was all
                        devoted to his children, as I have heard him say several times that he wuldn't care to die if it
                        wasn't for leaving his children. But that terrible monster death which is the unwelcome visitor
                        in all our homes, but which we know must come to us all sooner or later, took away his life from
                        him, so unexpected while sitting in his chair at his home and as the news came it was a sad and
                        terrible shock to us all. But we have the great hope that our loss is his gain and by the help
                        of God we will meet again some day.</p>

                    <p>With a sad heart, I will try to write an obituary of the life of my dear brother, to wit: He was
                        born June 12, 1875 and departed this life August 15, 1952. He was the son of Jack and Biddie
                        Moore. He was first married to Margaret Handshoe who preceded him in death. To this union was
                        born five children, three girls and two boys. One girl died in infancy, which leaves two boys
                        and two girls, Estle Moore-Willard, Ohio; Cess Moore, Parma, Michigan; Anthy Moore, Willard,
                        Ohio; and Mallie Patrick, Tram, Kentuckv. He also leaves two brothers and one sister. Samuel and
                        Tilvis Moore, both of Pyramid, Ky., and Mrs. Jane Castle, Hueysville, Ky. Brother was then
                        married to Dollie Shepherd who he leaves to mourn his loss. ;But I feel that our loss is his
                        eternal gain. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church and was a minister of the gospel. He
                        believed, loved, and preached the doctrine of Salvation by Grace. He leaves a vacant seat in his
                        home and in the church that cannot be filled. I was with him a lot during his last days, and
                        went to church with him. His talk was on Heaven and heavenly things. He realized that he had to
                        die and said there wasn't anything in his way. I went to the hospital with him and was at his
                        bedside when the death angel came and took him away. So children if you ever want to see father
                        again you will have to fall out with sin and make peace with the Lord, for I feel that brother
                        is resting in paradise, waiting that glorious resurrection day. So to his dear companion,
                        children, and grandchildren,&nbsp; cheer up and press on till we !-an meet brother around that
                        blood-washed Throne of King Emmanuel, where there will be no more separation, pain or death.</p>

                        six year ago, having her membership at the Samaria Church, where she was a good member, filling
                        her seat faithfully until the death angel called her home. She took sick and was taken to the
                        Prestonsburg Hospital for treatment, and on Sunday evening about the hour of eight, God called
                        her home to rest,- and away from the toils, pains, sorrows and worries of this natural life,
                        where she will sing and rejoice with Him throughout the age of Eternity. We should not worry
                        anymore, children, for our loss of her here is her Eternal gain. Children, mother is now gone
                        from us. We are sad; we are lonely here in the world, and those of us who have not made peace
                        with the Lord, should remember the life mother lived before us, and get ready as she was to meet
                        Him, so we can join mother and all praise the Lord together.</p>

                        old when he died January 12, 1953. He was the son of Keene Dye and Mandie Osborne Dye and is
                        survived by one living brother. Bert Dye. January 17, 1910, Larance Dye and Allie Gayheart were
                        married. They had nine children - Woodrow, Bill, Kendall, Jack, Kelly, Hoyse, Emma and Julie.
                        Two boys and one girl preceded him in death. Father was ill for many years. I believe he has a
                        good home in Heaven because the Bible says "With the Heart Man Believeth unto Righteousness and
                        with the Mouth confession is made unto Salvation." I had the privilege to see Papa come home and
                        tell his friends what great things the Lord had done for him. Then he wanted to be baptized so
                        he could have fellowship in the Old Regular Baptist Church. Brother Troy Nichols and Edd Mosley
                        baptized him the second Saturday in April, 19'51. Papa always attended Church when his health
                        permitted. The family circle has been broken, but it can be complete again if all the children
                        would repent of their sins and believe in the Lord, for God, is full of Love, Grace and Great
                        Mercy and says all that will come to him would ,not be cast out. We knew we must be born again
                        if we get peace with him. I want to say to all the children, if the Lambs Book of Life was
                        searched and Papa searched it, would your name be there' Mama's and mine would be there. Yours
                        could be there too, for the Bible says "Behold I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my
                        voice and will open the door, I will come in and sup with him and he with me." This is the
                        doctrine Papa believed. First, quit sinning then. repent of your former sins and believe from
                        the heart, for Christ tasted death for every man. I will close this Obituary by saying Papa is
                        resting from all his labors and his works follows him. I believe at the Resurrection, when Papa
                        arises with a body fashioned like Christ's glorious body. Mother and I, and I hope and pray all
                        the family, can be risen with him and go home to live forever.</p>

                        April 9, 1952, being 73 years and 11 months and 23 days old. He joined the Old Regular Baptist
                        at Pikeville and lived a true, faithful Christian life, until God called him away. He enjoyed
                        meeting with his good brothers and sisters in the Lord, and talked of the good things of the
                        Lord. He had been ailing for several years. His feet gave him lots of trouble and after he moved
                        out in the country and couldn't attend his church only once in a while, as he couldn't walk the
                        two miles to the bus line as he had no other ways of getting to his church unless his daughter
                        came in from Detroit, Mich. He missed his meeting so bad and he would read his Bible every day
                        and would get so much comfort from it. He was confined to his home over five months with a
                        stroke and suffered so much. He leaves a wife, Hattie Justice Honaker, and a daughter Fannie
                        Honaker, to mourn his loss. We miss his sweet company more than any one knows and a place is
                        vacant in our home that never can be filled. I want to live the life here that when God calls me
                        away I will meet my loved ones gone -on before.</p>

                    <p>It is with a sad heart that I now attempt to write a short obituary of the life of my precious
                        Mother, Jane Hall Stumbo.. She was the oldest daughter of Press and Florence Hall, who both
                        preceded her in death. She was married to Green Babe Stumbo in the year of 1910, and unto this
                        union were born seven children, six boys and one girl, of which two boys preceded her in death
                        as infants. Besides her bereaved husband, she left the following children to mourn her loss:
                        Lloyd, Glidden, Gladys, Margaret, and myself. Also a nephew. Foster who she reared from
                        childhood and was counted as one of her children. Mother joined the Old Regular Baptist Church
                        Sept. . 18, 1.938. and was baptized Oct. 15, 1938. * She took her. fellowship into the Beaver
                        Church at Drift. She attended Church regularly up until she became so ill that she couldn't get
                        there. Mother departed this life May 11, 1953, at the age of 62 years. ,She left a host of
                        friends, sisters and brothers in the Church, who have told me that they miss her more and more
                        all the time. Mother always welcomed everyone into her humble home and served them the very best
                        she had. Yes, I minx her more with the coming of each evening. It is so lonely for dad, and the
                        little grandchildren at the old home place. We all loved her so much, but Jesus loved her far
                        more. I have heard mother pray many prayers in secluded spots before she lay down to rest her
                        tired body at night. I feel sure that Mother is sleeping in the arms of Jesus tonight. So at her
                        passing the Beaver Church has. lost one of its most precious and faithful members. and the
                        community has lost one of its pious and old fashioned orderly working mothers. Mother was in
                        poor health for two or three years before she died. Many times during her sufferings, she prayed
                        for God to take her home and sometimes remarked that it would .be better if the doctors would
                        stand back and let her pass on to suffer no more. I have reasons to believe that mother is
                        resting until !Christ comes in a cloud, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, and ascend to
                        Heaven with a Shout. I am sure that we, her children will only live a Christian life, that we
                        can see her again, where parting will be no more. </p>

                    <p><strong>MARY ADKINS</strong></p>
                    <p>By request of the children I will write the obituary of Sister Mary Adkins. Sister Adkins was
                        born September 9, 1867, deceased, Sept. 6. 1950, being about 83 years of age at death. She
                        leaves four children, one boy and three girls, to mourn her loss. Sister Adkins was a member of
                        the Pikeville Church and was baptized by Brother Tom Hopkins about 40 years ago. I lived close
                        to her at the time of her death. ,She was burned up in her house. She was sick a year before
                        death. When she would go to smothering she would send for me to come and lay my hands on her
                        that she might rest. I want to say to the children, you have lost a good mother and to the
                        Pikeville Church, we lost a good member. But we feel that our loss is Heavens gain. To the
                        children yet in sin, if you ever see mother you'll have to fall out with sin and be born again.
                        Except you humble yourself and be born again you will not be in the first resurrection with the
                        righteous, who will go shouting home and hear ,him say, "fly wide ye everlasting gate and let my
                        bride come 'in." I believe that Sister Adkirs will be in that number. Tho her body sleeps in the
                        Pikeville Cemetery God knows where every dust is sleeping and in the resurrection he will bring
                        it forth. It will be a complete body in Heaven. ,It will be like His most glorified body.&nbsp;

                    <p>With a very sad heart I will undertake to write an obituary of my uncle and brother in the Lord.
                        Uncle was born in Pike County. Kentucky, December 25, 1868, the son of Sam and Kate Elswick
                        Adkins. He married Victoria Clark, and to this union were born eight children, four daughters
                        and four sons. To aunt Victoria, the sons and daughters, and uncles, sisters, you all know uncle
                        is gone from you and will never return, but by the grace of God, you all can see him again.
                        Uncle is gone, the place he once knew here, he will know no more. God's mercy will hover around
                        the sons and daughters and around Victoria; also around uncle's sons and daughters-in-laws for
                        their good care they gave through the sickness of uncle. ;Aunt Victoria, you still look for
                        uncle Will around the home. He's gone never to return. So he will sleep until the Trumpet sounds
                        to wake him, together with all the loved ones now resting from their labors, after which He will
                        take them to. that City which lies four
                        square.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>'It is with much sadness that we try to write an obituary of a blessed husband and a loving.
                        father and brother to wit: Jack Adkins, born to George and Alice Prater Adkins, June 10, 1895,
                        deceased this life Feb. 14, 1953, with a heart illness. Jack was the husband of Susie Hughes
                        Adkins, united in marriage October 12. 1916. To this union were born six children, five boys and
                        one girl. Georgia which deceased April 6, 1947, Orgie and Orville of Hueysville, Ky., Tramble of
                        Eastern, Ky., Mrs. Mildred Bellamy of Hueysville, Ky., Ezra serving in the Army, stationed at
                        Atlanta, Georgia, and Christine a daughter of Jake Hughes and also leaves five brothers . Bob
                        and Dee of Heuysville. Ky., Jonnie and Morton of Langley, Ky., Sam of Risner, Ky. Also three
                        sisters Mrs. Bill Thornsbury, Lessie, Michigan, Mrs. Harrison Ousley, Risner, Ky.. and Mrs. Kirk
                        Frasure, Louisville, Ky., and eight grand children and a host of relatives to mourn her loss.
                        Jack believed in the Old Baptist and prayed all the time through his sickness and said that the
                        good Lord had heard him and said he wasn't afraid to die for he was going to live with those
                        loved ones gone on before. He wanted us to bring Banner Manns to the :hospital, and he went with
                        us and Jack gave him his hand and told him that he wanted to be baptized and we told him that he
                        was too weak and would when he got a little stonger, but he took another heart attack and seen
                        he was going to die and he called his children and they went to him. He told them not to put it
                        off so long about their soul like he did and be good children and be good to one another and get
                        along with one another. Jack always was a good neighbor and treated everybody he met with
                        kindness and said just a few days before he died that if any body had an ill feeling toward him
                        he did not know it and that he didn't have one for anybody. So we sure do miss his kindness and
                        company here on earth, but sure do feel without a doubt that our loss is his eternal gain in
                        that bright home above where no sickness, nor pain, nor death shall come and all will be well
                        for ever.</p>

                    <p>With a sad and heavy heart I try to write an obituary of my dearest departed mother. Rilda Ellen
                        Clark, who was called from this poor mortal life to a far happier one in Heaven. She was born
                        February 7, 1894 and departed this life August 2, 1953, at the age of 59 years, 5 months and 27
                        days. She joined the Regular Baptist Church the morning of the day she passed away. She had
                        requested membership at the Little Salem Church at Dana, Ky. Many of her nearest friends thought
                        she had gone to the church many years ago, so good was her moral life. She was the daughter of
                        Sidney and Mary (Akers) Bryant and the grand daughter of the Rev. John Rhoda Akers, all who
                        preceded her in death. She was married to James Clark in October, 1924 and unto this union were
                        born two children. One son. Isaac Lee Clark and one daughter, Mary Bell Allen. She is survived
                        by her husband and two children and three step-daughters, who are, Hazel Amburgey, Claudie
                        Robinson and Freedie Robinette and also three brothers and three sisters; who are Abner,
                        Hillard, and Johnnie Bryant, Francis Honaker, Deliah Bryant, and Pearlie Adams and one sister
                        Ida Bryant. who preceded her in death. , Funeral was held at the Little Salem Church, Dana, Ky.,
                        with Elders Liney Boyd, Banner Mann and Baxter Osborne officiating. She was always ready to
                        serve the sick and needy at any time. Many is the time I have known her to go see the sick when
                        she was not able to get out of bed herself in reality. She has told my sister and I many times
                        that it was His wish for all people to care for the sick and needy and she has always asked us
                        to go when she herself was not able. ' 1 am sure all her friends who knew her well, loved her
                        and respected her as well, and she them. ,She has left many friends and neighbors to mourn her
                        passing. A kinder, more loving or more humble person 1 have never known to exist, except for His
                        only begotten Son. My one hope is to follow in her Blessed Footsteps.</p>

                        1907. She was left without a father when she was only nine years old. Before her father died she
                        had Spinal Meningitis, but the Lord let her get well. got shot to death., one little girl died
                        in infancy when she was in the hospital thirty years ago. She leaves a husband and one son, two
                        grand children, three brothers and three sisters to mourn her loss. But I feel like I can say,
                        "If she missed heaven who can get there". The Writer stood by the bed side and saw her go to
                        sleep. She had not opened her eyes for some time, but I saw her eyes open, she could not see me,
                        but she saw the Angels. no doubt, it was some of her loved ones that come after her soul. I do
                        believe her Soul is with her sister. brother, father, mother and her little baby today. and all
                        the infants that have ever died, and all the children of God that have died from the beginning
                        of time. Her blessed Soul will come and get her body soon, then both Soul and Body will sing
                        redemption song forever and forever. I want to say to the only son and husband. if you ever see
                        her anymore, you will have to repent this side of Heaven. To her blessed daughter-in-law get
                        ready. Your mother-in-law loved you and the two little children. Meet me. We loved her, yes we
                        loved her, But Angels loved her more, And they have sweetly called her, To yonder shining shore.
                        The Golden Gates were open. A gentle voice said come, And with farewells unspoken She calmly
                        entered Home.</p>

                    <p>George W. Hopkins was the son of Elder N. T. and Nancy Hopkins. Arminda Burke Hopkins was the
                        daughter of Green and Lorraine Burke. George W. Hopkins was born August 13, 1872, age 72 years.
                        Arminda Hopkins was born July 26, 1870 age about 80 years. They were married about 1892. making
                        their stay on earth together 60 years. Unto this union were born ten children, 4 sons and 6
                        daughters. Five of the children preceded them in death; three in infancy. two were grown. one
                        son and one daughter. The daughter's name was Nannie. She was a member of the Little Creek
                        Church. Five daughters were left to mourn their loss. Ida Damron, Minnie Hopkins, Sarah Compton.
                        Cordelia Compton and Margie Damron and several grandchildren. Arminda joined the old Regular
                        Baptist Church in 1904 and was baptized by Elder N. T. Hopkins. ;She belonged to the church 49
                        years. She filled her seat in the church as long as she was able. Brother George joined the Old
                        Regular Baptist Church about. 15 years ago. He always filled his seat as long as he was able.
                        Brother George was baptized by Elder Frank Hopkins. They both belonged to the Little Creek
                        Church. I can say as a truth that the old church has lost two of the best members they had in
                        their fellowship. I can say we have lost two good members and the community has lost two good
                        neighbors. I can say for myself that I did enjoy talking with them concerning the Bible and on a
                        hereafter. We believe that when they departed this life they met with children and their
                        brethren and sisters and we believe that they know each otter. Brother George and Sister
                        Arminda, only seven days difference in their deaths, we feel they did not have to stay away from
                        each other long. They were laid in the Potter Graveyard at the Mouth of Little Creek to await
                        the great resurrection morning when the .trumpet of God sounds then they will awake out of their
                        sleep. What a happy time that will be for the children of God. The funeral of Brother G. W. and
                        his good wife will be preached the last day of July and the first of August, 1954 at Yeager.
                        Kentucky. Father and mother are not dead, but only sleeping, just waiting to hear our Good
                        Master say while the little birds are sweetly singing, their graves are sweetly sinking away.

                    <p>It is with a sad and aching heart that I try to make this attempt to write an obituary of my dear
                        beloved husband, Charles Wellman Tackett, and Darling little son, Ronala Clifford Tackett.
                        Charles was born March 15. 1922 and deceased this life November 9, 1951. He was the son of the
                        late G. C. (Cleave) Tackett and Dorsie Mullins Tackett. He was Z9 years, 8 months and 4 days
                        old. He entered the U. S. Army October 23. 1942, spending 7 months. 12 days in the states, 2
                        years, 4 months, 24 days in. the Southern Philippines, Luzon, New Guinea and Manila. On. Wall
                        City, Manila on February 23, 1945 he was wounded in the hip. He won many ribbons, Bronze Stars.
                        Badges and also a Purple Heart. He was a Squad leader in the 5th Cavalry and carried the rank of
                        Sgt. He was honorably discharged on October 22. 1945 as a disabled veteran of World War 11I. ,He
                        was married to Josephine Bowling November 17. 1945, and to this union were born five children,
                        four boy_ Charles Jr., Gene Wellman, Terry Lee and Ronald Clifford; one daughter. Bonnie Ann
                        Tackett. Ail the children are living but one. Ronald Clifford (Ronnie) was born the 17th day of
                        May, 19452, six months and eight days after Charles' death and lived six months and eighteen
                        days and died with pneumonia, December 2, 1952. Little Ronnie has gone to that Heavenly home and
                        I feel his daddy welcomed him home. For he never got the chance to see him in this world.
                        Charles was a miner at Henry Clay, Kentucky. a member of UMWA Local 7916 and belonged to the
                        American Legion of Kentucky. Post 29'7. On Monday morning, November 5, 1951, Charles taken sick
                        and lived until Friday November 9, 1951. He died twelve miles beyond West Liberty while on his
                        way to a polio hospital at Lexington, Kentucky. He didn't belong to any church but believed in
                        the Old Regular Baptist Church and Brother Jim Sanders was his favorite preacher. I feel with
                        all my heart that he is at rest for I saw him praying and he told me a few hours .before he died
                        that he couldn't get well and wanted to tell me that he wasn't lost. He said. "I one time was
                        lost but now I'm not." After he told me that he had the sweetest smile on his face and was as
                        humble and good as a baby. I want to say to his brothers and sisters, Elmer, Lum, Hillard,
                        Carol, Aroll, Hatler, Erma and Garnet Fay, you have given up a good brother who has gone home to
                        rest from all sickness and troubles and if you ever want to see him again you will have to
                        repent and live for Jesus. Since his daddy is at rest with him, .I'll say to his mother, Mrs.
                        Tackett, when you give Charles up you give up a true born child of God. I do believe with all my
                        heart for God showed me in a dream that we had nothing to worry about for he was waiting just on
                        the inside of the Pearly Gates waiting to welcome the rest of the family home. Sometimes I can
                        see that sweet face with that smile that will live in my memory as long as I live, waiting for
                        the children and me. If I can see that sweet face in that Glory world where there will be no
                        pneumonia, polio or doctors giving shots. it will be all peace, joy and love Thank the good Lord
                        for putting me on that road that leads to Heaven. Now, I'll say to our children as he called
                        them, "Charles, Jr.. Daddy's Boy, Bonnie Ann, Daddy's Blue Bird, Gene Wellman. "daddy's Bear'.
                        Terry Lee, `Daddy's Doll,", daddy has gone and left us in this troubled world to live our lives
                        without him. but Mother will be with you as long as she lives. So let's be good and pray each
                        night that God will guide us and when this life is over let us live with Jesus and Daddy and
                        little Ronnie forever. The second Saturday and Sunday of September in 1954, a memorial of
                        Charles and Ronald will be held at his home on Caney Creek, Kentucky. Brother Paris Clifford
                        Tackett, Brother Sol Kiser, Brother Earl Belcher, Brother Dexter Church, Brother Kasby Conway,
                        Brother Orville Tackett and Brother Jim Sanders are called in the memorial. Written by a broken

                    <p>I will try, by the help of the Lord to say a few words about my dear mother. She was born July
                        12. 1904 and died March 17, 1946. She was married twice. First to John Davis, he died in 1929.
                        She later married R. D. Manns. He died in 1945. She was the mother of nine children, seven boys
                        and two girls. One boy died when he was eighteen months old. Eight of us are still living. Mommy
                        was the daughter of J, H. Richie and Rachel McIntosh Richie. Mommy was a very humble woman all
                        her life She showed very little temper. I don't remember seeing my mother do an unchristian act
                        in my life. She joined the Old Regular Baptist Church at Steels Creek in 1938. She was baptized
                        November 6. 1938 by Elder Hawley Warrens and E. H. Howard. She lived a faithful life until death
                        and I have missed her so much since she left me. I am the only child that is trying to follow
                        her. All the other children are out in sin. I often pray for them because they have no mother or
                        father to pray for them. A short time after I joined the Old Regular Baptist I was carried away
                        to Heaven in a dream. I was led up a narrow set of steps by a shining light, and my mother came
                        and kissed me before the throne of God. I believe with all my heart I will meet mother again
                        when I leave this world. Mother was a poor woman and had a very hard time on earth. but I
                        believe she has gained a good home in Heaven, and I hope I can join her there some day.</p>

                    <p>With a sad heart I will attempt to write a short sketch of my dear mother to-wit Josephine
                        Mosley. Mother was born August 30. 187'5, deceased Dec. 13 1947. -She was the daughter of
                        William and Nancy Short. She was married to Elder L. D. Mosley about the year 1893, and to this
                        union were born 13 children. ten still living. Mother joined the Old Regular Baptist Church
                        about the year of 1894 and took up fellowship with the. Old Caney Fork Church and remained a
                        member of that church until her death. We the children have lived a lonesome life since father
                        and mother have left us. The night mother died I was standing by her bedside and asked her if
                        she wanted a doctor. She said no, I'll be alright in the morning. I have no doubt but what mama
                        is asleep in the arms of Jesus. The good Lord 'has blessed me in a dream to see mama and papa
                        together side by side in the most beautiful home I ever saw. I hope the rest of the children
                        will turn to the Lord and repent of their sins and be ready to meet mama and papa with me or.
                        that glorious resurrection morning, when the dead shall come out of their graves and meet the
                        Lord in the air. and go on to that beautiful home called Heaven. as I feel and believe I will be
                        in that blood washed band on that day.</p>

                    <p>With a sad and broken heart I will try to write an obituary of my dear beloved husband Charlie
                        Conn. He was born February 17, 1916. departed this life December 16, 1952. Making his stay on
                        earth 36 years and 10 months. He was the son of James and Lona Conn. He was married to Evelean
                        Reynolds December 19. 1942. Unto this union were born three children, two girls and one boy,
                        Jimmie Joe, Charlene and Ilene. Jimmie Joe preceded him in death. He leaves Charlene, Ilene and
                        myself, a father. three sisters, two brothers, a host of friends and relatives to mourn his
                        loss, but we feel our loss is his eternal gain. He joined the church the fourth Sunday in 1950
                        and about a year later he said he had a job to do. He said he felt that he was called to preach.
                        He wasn't in the stand but a few times. I never saw any humbler person than he was. He preached
                        love and salvation by the Grace of God. He always liked to hear the Brethren preach sound
                        doctrine. Our home is so lonesome. we miss him so much. He was so good to his family. He was
                        loved by the church and all that knew him. We would always go to church on Sun day. He would
                        hate to leave his brothers and sisters after church. I feel with all my heart that he is at
                        rest. His Memorial will be preached the last day of July and the first day of August, 1954 which
                        is an odd Saturday and Sunday. Everyone is invited.</p>

                        to-wit: Floyd Caudill, born January 6. 1889, departed this life, February 5, 1953. He was the
                        son of Harden and Mary C audill. He was married to Louise Caudill. To this union were born 12
                        children. Four children preceded him in death, leaving a host of grandchildren. three sisters.
                        two brothers, and father to mourn his loss. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church Sept. 4.
                        1938. Not long after he joined he began preaching. the gospel. H e stood for the old time
                        doctrine and preached a free salvation by grace through faith to the believers. I have hope of
                        meeting father again. I will say to the rest of the children that are on the barren mountain of
                        sin, if you ever expect to see father again, you must fall out with sin and be born again.
                        Children don't forget daddys' counsel always begging you all to close in with our Blessed Lord.
                        Well, there is one more thing I would like to say about daddy. I was blessed to spend about 12
                        years with him going to good meetings. He stood firm on the good old way. I feel our loss is his
                        eternal gain.</p>

                    <p><strong>ALICE MITCHELL</strong></p>
                    <p>With special love and request of Sister Alice Mitchell's children, I will write a sketch of the
                        life of Sister Alice. She was born on Robinson Creek, Pike County. Kentucky. January 16, 1869.
                        Deceased this life December 30. 1952. She was the daughter of Jack Newsom and Margaret Newsom.
                        ;She was nearly eighty-three years old, and was married to C. C. Mitchell in the year 1889. To
                        this union were born seven children, five boys and two girls. Names as follows: Levi. Andy,
                        Kenis. Rob and Crit and girls, Margaret and Frances. Kenis and Frances preceded her in death.
                        Sister Alice had 42 grand children and a large number of great grandchildren and a host of
                        friends weeping over her. Sister ;Alice joined the Samaria Church of Regular Baptist in the year
                        1899. She was baptized by the hands of Elder John Akers. Belonged to the church near 54 years.
                        God blessed that long record. ,Sister Alice was one of the old fashioned pilgrims. Regardless
                        .how many styles arrived it never changed Sister Alice. She lived a clean virtuous life, toiled
                        and worked hard all her life as the writer of this sketch knew her near 45 years. Her husband
                        was an old Regular Baptist minister. When he was going to his church and Association. Sister
                        Alice would care for the home and the children. I never in all my knowing heard of Sister Alice
                        bringing anything into the church to hurt the peace of God's family. She told me one day the
                        Lord would render justice to all. That is true, be not deceived. God is not mocked. What so ever
                        a man soweth that shall he also reap. We don't have many old pilgrims like Sister Alice. I feel
                        sure. I had a love for sister Alice. When she was taken sick she only lived near a month. I
                        heard her pray that if it were the good Lord's will let her get better. Then she said to me have
                        her funeral preached at the old home place where her son Crit Mitchell now lives. Now to the
                        children. you lost a special friend. a mother indeed .and truth you took care of so well. There
                        is a seat vacant in the church and home where Sister Alice remained so long, yet I feel our loss
                        .of Sister Alice on earth is a great gain to her home in Heaven. She is now resting from all her
                        toils and labor with her good husband. Crit, your home was lonesome when mother was taken away
                        to the cemetery. :I have seen :Sister Alice shout and praise the Lord many a time in my early
                        days. Sister Alice could have dressed herself fine. yet she dressed herself in modest apparel
                        according to the scriptures. To sister Margaret her only daughter, you gave such a tender hand
                        of help to mother. Yet the hope I feel you have you can meet mother again and live forever with
                        her in a land of everlasting joy. I believe we will know our loved ones with a knowledge
                        superior to natural knowledge. Children, in that home your good mother will be your sister the
                        generation of Jesus Christ. God bless all of old brother C. C. Mitchell and Alice's children. It
                        seems to me you all are working for a home beyond this vale of tears. Sister Alice cooked and
                        fed the church members. not, only the church members but all who came to her home. The children
                        are doing the same, by the terror of the Lord we persuade men and women to leave the field of
                        sin. Listen one and all: We can't win the love of sinners and draw them with words not of good
                        spirit. God is love, if we're born again, we're born of love, for God is love. Now in the
                        closing of this obituary, I pray in behalf of Sister Alice's children, a happy journey as we go
                        home. Not only her children but her grandchildren and great grandchildren. He that feareth God
                        and worketh righteousness is accepted from generation to generation. I must close. I could say
                        many more good things in regard to our beloved Sister Alice Mitchell, whom I bid farewell for
                        awhile.</p>

                    <p><strong>ELDER JEFF MAY</strong></p>
                    <p>At the request of my brothers and sisters, I will try with a sad heart. to write an obituary of
                        our beloved brother, to wit Jeff May. He was one of a family of ten and the third to go on to
                        that country above which we heard father and mother talk so much about while they were here with
                        us. Jeff May was born on August 29, 1890, and deceased this life on July 29. 1953, making his
                        stay here on earth 62 years and eleven months. We feel now that he is in Heaven with Jesus in
                        that land where there will be no night. They need no candle, neither the light of the sun for
                        the Lord giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever. We feel that he is with our
                        father, F. J. May, who left us on May 25, 1937, leaving us a bright hope that he is in Heaven.
                        Brother Bennie May left us on December 25, 1948, telling us he was going to Heaven where all
                        tears are wiped from our eyes. And on June 10. 1952, Mary May. our sweet mother, left us and
                        went to see Jesus, Father, Ruthie, Bennie and all the loved ones which are in Heaven. Why do we
                        believe all these things so strongly? The Bible tells us, "By their fruits ye shall know them."
                        They all bore the fruits while they were here with us. Brother Jeff joined the Regular Baptist
                        Church the third Saturday in August, 1944. and was baptized the same day by Elder Jack Thomas.
                        He was ordained to the ministry by the Island Creek Church of the Regular Baptist on the third
                        Saturday of November, 1948. and we believe he walked. talked and lived as a faithful Christian.
                        Brother Jeff, like Paul, was never married and after God forgave him of his sins, he had nothing
                        to do but serve God every day. After he was called to preach, his joy was in telling the people
                        what the Lord had done for him, and what He would do for them if they would fall out with sin
                        and hear the Word and obey it. He was appointed by the Church as assistant moderator and served
                        the church faithfully until death. Brother Jeff and Elder Jack Thomas, our moderator, walked
                        together, hand in hand. which makes us think of Bible days when Christ was here and sent out his
                        Apostles two by two. We believe that Jeff walked, talked and preached and lived a good life as
                        anyone we ever knew. He could truthfully repeat the saying of Paul when he had to leave this
                        world; "I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. ,I have kept my faith. henceforth
                        there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord. the righteous Judge, shall give
                        me at that day. And not to me only, but unto all those that love his appearing." No one knows
                        how we miss Brother Jeff in the Church and at our old home place. Since our loved ones have
                        left, the old home looks so lonely, but some sweet day in the future, we feel we will see them
                        all in that home not made with human hands and live eternally in Heaven where parting is no
                        more. Due to the sickness we have in our family, we did not get to have our Mothers Memorial
                        service this year. If we live and it is the Lord's will we will have Jeff. mother and May
                        family's memorial on the third Saturday and Sunday in July. 1954, on the Sword Cemetery, Island
                        Creek, Kentucky. Everyone is invited and welcome.</p>

                    <p>It is with a sad and lonely heart that I try to write an obituary of my beloved husband. Coyen
                        Ledford was born September 26. 1885. and died July 23, 1952. He was married to Fannie Stewart,
                        February 13, 1914, unto them were born eight children, six daughter's and two sons. One daughter
                        preceded her daddy in death. In 1917 he made a confession of faith in Christ and was admitted
                        into the Regular Baptist Church of Caney Creek by baptism. He lived a wonderful Christian life.
                        The last man he talked with was brother Jim Sanders an hour before he passed away. Brother Jim
                        was one of the men he dearly loved. He didn't seem to value his own life too much. It was the
                        welfare of others. We were never financially rich but we had something money could never buy,
                        and that was the love. happiness and harmony in our home. I feel unworthy sometimes that God has
                        given me so much to be thankful for. He is the only one that can help us and stand by and
                        lighten our burden in time of trouble. My husband was a teacher and taught school for more than
                        22 years. he loved children and had so much patience in teaching them. The last five years of
                        his life he wasn't able to work and he spent a lot of his time at school, he felt so much at
                        home in a school room. When he would visit the school the children were anxious for him to tell
                        them a story of some kind and the teacher of each room he would go in would .give him the floor
                        to talk to the children. Some times it would be Bible stories, he would tell them, which they
                        were always anxious to hear. ,Since he has been gone some have become Christians and they told
                        me he was their inspiration to live a Christian life. I know it will only be a short time until
                        we will all be together in that most glorious Land called Heaven.</p>

                    <p><strong>CLEVE HALL</strong></p>
                    <p>I feel it my duty to write a short obituary of Brother Cleve Hall who was born November 4, 1886,
                        deceased November 23, 152. He was the son of John and Merviania Hall, married Leona Hall about
                        1915. To this union were born five children. four girls, one boy. One girl preceded him in
                        death. Survivors include, Willie. Kite, Ky.; Myrtle Caudill, Covington, Ky.; Garnett Childres,
                        Puncheon, Ky.; Hattie Ratliff, Coeburn. Va. He was a member of the Rebecca Church of the Old
                        Regular Baptist. He did not believe in mixing with anything but Baptists. He was plain and loved
                        the old time doctrine. His favorite preachers were Brother E. V. Hopkins, N. W. Meade, W. S,
                        Tolliver, Elder N. W. Meade baptized him about 22 years ago. So we hope our loss is his eternal
                        gain. I want to say to the children, if you ever expect to get to Heaven you must believe on
                        Jesus and be born again and meet your father in Heaven. May God bless Sister Leona in her
                        lonesome hours and help her to let her light shine. before their children, that. when the end
                        comes we can all meet where parting will be no more.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>JOHN HALL</strong></p>
                    <p>It now becomes my duty by request to write an obituary of my dear old Daddy to wit: John Hall. He
                        was born May 21. 1877 and died June 20, 1952, being 75 years and 20 days old when he passed
                        away. He was the son of Eligie and Rissie Hall. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church May 11.
                        1912 and lived a faithful member until death. He was united in marriage to Helen Hall and to
                        this union were born 10 children of which three deceased. He also has three children by a former
                        marriage. He leaves a good old widow and 10 children to mourn his loss. Tack, Sarah. Lillie,
                        Jerry, Effie. Ettie. Bert, Laura Virgie, and Johnnie: Kate and Ervin, Emmitt preceded him in
                        death. He also leaves one step son Lonnie Hall and one step San preceded him. in death., He is
                        also survived by several grand children to mourn his loss. ,He lived to see seven of his
                        children join the old church in which two have been ministers for over 21 years. Tack and
                        Johnnie, have fought side by side with daddy. We miss him so much. but it does not mean so much
                        for us to separate like some for we will meet again soon, where there is no death. I the writer
                        have heard him say he thanked God to see his children stepping in his tracks and going a little
                        beyond him in the work of the Lord. He said that he saw Old Brother Tom Mosley and Brother Red
                        John Hamilton just before he died and that he was going to live with them over there. No
                        children that ever lived had a better daddy than we had. He called me to his bedside two days
                        before he died, and asked me to write this obituary. I will say to my dear old mother, it won't
                        be long until you can join daddy in that beautiful home where Jesus is. He often prayed for his
                        wicked children that were out in sin. Q will say to them your time may be next, and if you ever
                        meet daddy you must quit your meaniness and get down on your knees and pray and believe in
                        Jesus, until he saves your poor souls. I could go on and on telling of the good things about
                        daddy. but actions speak louder than words, when us children would .gather around his bed he
                        seemed to say like Paul, I have fought a good fight, I have kept the faith, hence forth there is
                        a crown laid up for me. 5o brothers and sisters, let us all meet daddy, I want to see him so
                        much. and not him only, but all of my good Brothers and sisters that have gone and I have a hope
                        some day I will -is t. a way I feel now I don't care how soon. I am not afraid to die. The Bible
                        says, Oh death I will be thy Plag, Oh grave I will be thy destruction. Daddy died fully
                        satisfied with his home in the old church, despite so many lies that was told concerning him not
                        being satisfied, if you that told those lies, happen to read this obituary let me say, I hope
                        you repent before it is too late. If you don't the Bible says all liars shall have their part in
                        the lake that burns with fire and brimstone so may God bless us all to live more closer to God
                        each day and night and when death comes. them blessed little angels will go through death with
                        us. A memorial of daddy and .Sister Kate and all of the deceased members of the Little Dove
                        Church will be preached the fourth Saturday and Sunday in June, 1954. Everybody invited. </p>

                    <p><strong>MATILDA CATHERINE JONES</strong></p>
                    <p>Matilda Catherine Jones born August 17, 1897, deceased December 12, 1952, making her stay on
                        earth 65 years. three months and 25 days. She was the daughter of Richard and Mahalie Little.
                        Married to Joe Jones, August 23, 1906. To, this union were born ten children. seven boys and
                        three girls. Two boys and two girls preceded her in death, leaving five boys and one girl, and
                        eight grandchildren. Three brothers and one sister. She joined the Old Regular Baptist Church
                        the last Sunday in May, 1929, and was baptized the 2nd Sunday in June. 1929 by Eider E. V.
                        Hamilton at Old Samaria Church. She has gone from us to Heaven. The Bible has much to say about
                        Heaven where we believe our Sister is now. They are plain things that are said.- There are no
                        tears in Heaven, there is no sorrow, nor crying, there's no pain in Heaven. No need of a doctor,
                        no one sick, then thank God there is no death in Heaven. Paul said, "the last enemy that shall
                        be destroyed, is death". John in his vision on the Isle of Patmos tells us that death was cast
                        into the Lake of Fire. How many times our hearts are made heavy as we see Loved ones taken from
                        our homes and families to be with us no more, but in Heaven there is no death. There is no night
                        in Heaven. John said. "And the gates of it s'-all not be closed at all by day, for there shall
                        be no night there." You know the Lord told Enoch to go up to Heaven, he went up, and never
                        returned. In Heaven we will have fellowship with all the Saints. God has taken from our precious
                        Brother Joe Jones and his children a loving companion, a loving mother. Our Sister had her
                        troubles here, she lost a loving little daughter many years ago. Two sons left her, one got
                        killed in a car accident, the other one was killed in the Army of the United States. Her father
                        and mother and Sister have gone, but bless her cripple husband and children left here to mourn
                        her loss. She leaves one sister. Brother Joe. it won't be long that you will be lonesome
                        anymore. Children if you ever see your mother any more you will have to be born again. Bless the
                        only daughter, you waited on mother, as long as she was here. Children unto Him that loved us,
                        and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made unto us to drink of that fountain of
                        water that never runs dry. Your blessed mother has all things, plentiful now, a new home to live
                        in forever, and forever. "Meet me, meet me", mother is calling to you children, come and live
                        with me in Heaven where things are beautiful. Listen, children, you know you had a good
                        Christian mother. Do you want to see her? If you do live like mother lived, if you want to see
                        her again. God bless the family one and all. </p>

                    <p>Corbett Tackett, the son of Jay and Sarah Tackett, was born February 23, 1900, deceased May 10,
                        1953.. Brother Corbett was married to Victory Hall, to which union wag born seven children, 4
                        boys and 3 girls. The three girls died in infancy. His wife died several years ago and he had a
                        hard time to raise his orphan children. die was afflicted with rheumatism for many years. He
                        also fell and injured his back.. He was in different hospitals but they failed to do him any
                        good. He never was able to walk any more. His limbs drawed till he was in the most pitiful
                        condition I ever saw. But God being rich in mercy blessed him to give me his crippled hand and
                        tell a wonderful experience of grace, and on November 26, 1952, he waited until the fourth
                        Saturday in January hoping to get better to be baptized, but those hopes failed. So on that cold
                        day of January w_- carried him to the water and he was baptized on a cot by Elders M. V. Burke,
                        Jesse Hampton, Malcom Ousley, Jonah Tackett, Jethro Hampton and Dallis Burke. He was so happy he
                        said the water didn't seem to be cold to him We had several good meetings in his little humble
                        home which gave him so much joy, and when we would hold prayer. Brother Corbett would raise his
                        voice in prayer for his boys, that they would leave the field of sin and turn to the Lord before
                        it would be too late. So I want to say to his orphans, children and brothers and sisters, and
                        many friends, if you ever see Brother Corbett again you will have to make peace with God and
                        meet him in Heaven, where he will not be afflicted. He said he wanted to go on and meet his
                        blessed old dad and mother, in Heaven. So I believe his faith and hope was real. I feel that the
                        church has lost a good brother-all of our loss is Heavens Eternal. and great gain.</p>

                    <p>With sadness I will try to write a 'short obituary of the life of a dear sister to-wit: Martha
                        McKinney Deal. She was the daughter of Milton McKinney and Rosy Moore McKinney. She was born
                        October 31, 1899, died November 23, 1952. She was 53 years and 23 days old when she diea. Was
                        married to Pharoah Deal in 1919 and unto this union were born five children, four boys and one
                        girl. Two of the boys died in infancy. The girl, two boys, her husband Pharoah left to mourn the
                        loss of mother. We feel that our loss is her eternal gain in Heaven. She joined the Old Regular
                        Baptist Church in the year 1917, and lived a faithful member until death. She had her membership
                        with Little Zion Church and later due to ill health became very ill and unable to go very far
                        moved her membership. to the Pilgrims Home Church and remained a good member till death. I
                        believe she is just gone on waiting for all who love in that bright city, where there is no
                        night, there will be the Lord. I believe we all will see Sister Martha again" no sickness, or
                        death there. I believe sister Martha will be there, her suffering and worries will all be over.
                        I believe she lived a good Christian life and she seemed so good to Pharoah and her children.
                        'So I will say to her children, if you ever want to see mother again, you must fall out with
                        sin, and take up the offered mercies of :God. !1 will say to you brother Pharoah, I believe you
                        are on the right road, just press on to that glory land. Sister Martha, your good wife will be
                        waiting in that glory land for you.</p>
