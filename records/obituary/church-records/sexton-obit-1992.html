	<p><strong>ANDREW AND ZINA PACK SEXTON</strong>. It is with a lonely heart, I will with the help of my Heavenly Father
		write the obituary of our dear Mother and Father. Andrew Sexton and Zina Pack Sexton. Dad was born November 28, 1906
		and passed away to a better home October 24, 1985. He was the last surviving son of the late Green and Amanda Wicker
		Sexton. Mom was born February 22, 1908 to the late Stanly and.... Minerva Standord Pack of Boones Camp, Kentucky.
		She was called to her better home November 17, 1991. They were blessed with 6 children of whom 5 remain here on
		earth. One son Edgar Ray Sexton died at the age of 8 years in 1947. They are survived by 1 son Donnie Sexton of
		Paris, Kentucky. Four daughters, Christine Stumbo of Drift, Kentucky; Pauline Rice of Richmond, Ind; Lucille Mae
		Prestonsburg. Kentucky; and Judith May Lexington, Kentucky. Ten grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren one sister
		each, Margie Sexton Bradshaw, of Kentucky and Lizzie Pack Shelton of Indiana. We miss them very much, but we know
		that our loss is heaven's gain. Mom had been a member of the old beaver regular baptist church for about 60 years.
		Dad was also a member of the same church. Our parents were kind and loving. They taught us to respect for all people
		and respect and love for each other. Our friends could always come and visit anytime and were always made welcome.
		They lived at Drift, Ken- tucky all of their married life. We miss them very much, but we can take joy in knowing
		they don't have to suffer any more and we can see them again in Heaven if we live for the Lord and do his will. We
		will hear Him say, "Good Morning Child, Welcome to This Brand New City" when our life is over. I say to all my
		family "Accept the Lord as your personal Savior and have the Peace that only He can give you in your heart. Prepare
		to see Mom and Dad in their New Home. It can be your Home too. Mom and Dad's life here was a living testimony for
		their children.
		Written by: their daughter and sister in the Lord Christine Stumbo.</p>
