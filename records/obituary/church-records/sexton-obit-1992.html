					<p><strong>ANDREW AND ZINA PACK SEXTON</strong>. It is with a lonely heart, I will with the help of my
						Heavenly Father write the obituary of our dear Mother and Father. Andrew Sexton and Zina Pack Sexton.
						Dad was born November 28, 1906 and passed away to a better home October 24, 1985. He was the last
						surviving son of the late Green and Amanda Wicker Sexton. Mom was born February 22, 1908 to the late
						Stanly and.... Minerva Standord Pack of Boones Camp, Kentucky. She was called to her better home
						November 17, 1991. They were blessed with 6 children of whom 5 remain here on earth. One son Edgar Ray
						Sexton died at the age of 8 years in 1947. They are survived by 1 son Donnie Sexton of Paris,
						Kentucky. Four daughters, Christine Stumbo of Drift, Kentucky; Pauline Rice of Richmond, Ind; Lucille
						Mae Prestonsburg. Kentucky; and Judith May Lexington, Kentucky. Ten grandchildren and 13
						great-grandchildren one sister each, Margie Sexton Bradshaw, of Kentucky and Lizzie Pack Shelton of
						Indiana. We miss them very much, but we know that our loss is heaven's gain. Mom had been a member of
						the old beaver regular baptist church for about 60 years. Dad was also a member of the same church.
						Our parents were kind and loving. They taught us to respect for all people and respect and love for
						each other. Our friends could always come and visit anytime and were always made welcome. They lived
						at Drift, Ken- tucky all of their married life. We miss them very much, but we can take joy in knowing
						they don't have to suffer any more and we can see them again in Heaven if we live for the Lord and do
						his will. We will hear Him say, "Good Morning Child, Welcome to This Brand New City" when our life is
						over. I say to all my family "Accept the Lord as your personal Savior and have the Peace that only He
						can give you in your heart. Prepare to see Mom and Dad in their New Home. It can be your Home too. Mom
						and Dad's life here was a living testimony for their children. Written by: their daughter and sister
						in the Lord Christine Stumbo.</p>
