                    <p><strong>JAMES EDWARD CAUDILL:</strong></p>
                    <p>Rejoice with them that rejoice ans weep with them that weep...a commandment God gives us as we
                        travel here on earth.</p>
                    <p>His footstool. Through God's infinite mercies and his strength under girding us, we will try, by
                        request of the family to write the obituary of our dear nephew James Edward Caudill.</p>
                    <p>James E. Caudill, Jimmy was born into this life August 20, 1955 departed this life June 29, 1980
                        making his stay here on earth 24 years ten months, and eight days. Born the only child to
                        Herbert and Marietta Caudill Jr. making much joy in their home till that call went out and Jimmy
                        answered the appointment we all will keep.</p>
                    <p>Beside his mother and father he leaves to mourn his passing his grandfather Herbert and
                        grandmother Mary (deceased) Mattie Caudillof Premium, Kentucky and grandmother Minnie Sexton of
                        Colson, Kentucky (the widow of the late Elder John Sexton). Also a host of aunts and uncles
                        survive.</p>
                    <p>A flower has been taken, one that fulfilledthe joy of parent- hood resting under that Great
                        Altar, waiting for that joyful day of ressurection, God's own-redeemed. Jimmy was loved by all
                        that knew him, a smile for those he met. Hardly had he time in his short stay here to wander far
                        away.</p>
                    <p>To Herbert and Marietta - don't let that ring of love in Heaven be severed. Let God enter your
                        lives that you may be united again. To his many friends and family - be close together in this
                        life, share and love one another, this is only the first one to share sorrow over, but its
                        inevitable if we live here long enough.</p>
                    <p>Repent and let God be your Saviour, that Heaven may be yours and the family united over there
                        together. Our humblest prayers and God's consoling peace rest and remain with each of you.</p>

                    <p><strong>ADA SLONE:</strong></p>
                    <p>Ada Slone was born February 23, 1897. She departed this life December 24, 1978, making her stay
                        here on earth 81 years nine months and 24 days. She was the daughter of Aminda and Perry Slone.
                    </p>
                    <p>Early in life she met this wonderful man Miles M. Slone who preceeded her in death on April 30,
                        1977. She mirried Miles in 1913 and unto this union were born 11 children one preceeded her in
                        death, which leaves ten still living.</p>
                    <p>Camellus Slone of Tennessee, Myrtle Pratt of Michigan Clyde Slone of Albany, Ohio; Marie Prater
                        of Dundas, Ohio; Winston Slone of Kendallville, Indiana; Herman Slone of Missouri ; Ruby Tiller
                        of West Virginia; Ruth Pyck of Kendallville, Indiana; Mirando Slone of Dunsas, Ohio; and Bernard
                        Slone of Alburn, Indiana; and one step- daughter Brookie Tiller of Oak Hill, Ohio.</p>
                    <p>Mother has been a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church family for about 40 or 50 years. She
                        was a hard working woman, raising her children, but was so loving and kind to us all. I am
                        sitting here in my home tonight so lonesome for my mother and dad. </p>
                    <p>Miranda and mother made their home with my husband, Melvin and me after dad died. Miranda and I
                        took such good care of her with Melvin's help. I guess there wasn't anything we didn't try to do
                        for her and dad. She would want the brothers and sisters in the church to come and have
                        services. They were sweet to us all in time of our sickness and death of our loving mother and
                        dad. She has several grandchildren and great-grandchildren who miss her very much.</p>
                    <p>She had her fellowship with Maggie Home Church in Dundas, Ohio. I feel like I will meet them both
                        in that beautiful home around the throne of God. I walk and talk with them in my dreams at
                        night.</p>
                    <p>There is just no way of putting on paper how much I loved my mother and dad, only God knows my
                        heart.</p>

                    <p><strong>EARL TACKETT:</strong></p>
                    <p>With the help of God, I will attempt to write an obituary oy my precious brother, Earl Gene
                        Tackett.</p>
                    <p>Earl was born December 13, 1938 in Weeksbury, Ky and died January 24, 1980 in New Boston.
                        Michigan, making his stay here on earth just forty two years.</p>
                    <p>Earl was the son of Sol and Annie Osborne Tackett. He was married to Shirley Smith in 1956. To
                        them were born four children; one daughter, Debra; three sons Jeffery, Wade, and Wayne. He
                        leaves his family, four brothers James, Clarence, Sol Jr, and Oscar Robert; and five sisters
                        Kathryn, Bertha, Margie, Mae, and Mary. Many friends and relatives mourn his loss.</p>
                    <p>Earl was a hard woeker and a good provider for his family. He was a frim believer in work and
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>He taught his children that all through life. He was good to people and had more friends than I
                        could men- tion. God knows all things and he is the Judge. He does all things for a purpose.</p>
                    <p>Earl will be missed in our family reunion this year.</p>
                    <p>But I hope someday we can have a bigger and better reunion in Heaven, where there won't be
                        anymore heart attacks, and things to take our loved ones away. I want to say to all the family
                        that has not repented, to repent and live for Jesus, for Jesus and His way. We all love and miss
                        Earl so muchand I know his good companion and children have spent many lonely hours. But be
                        patient and press on.</p>

                        daughters Mrs. Rolland</p>

                        and many many friends and loved ones to mourn her passing. Sister Nancy joined the Old Regular
                        Baptist Church at Thornton, Letcher County, ky and in the year 1956, she came to Little
                        Pilgrim's Home Church near Milan, Indiana by letter and attended faithfully to all the Sister
                        Churches that she could and as long as she was able. Surely, everyone that knew Sister Nancy can
                        say she really let her light shine and will always be remembered by her brothers and sisters in
                        the Lord and friends of this community. </p>
                    <p>Sister Nancy lived her life and I feel that she is now resting in the Paradise of God. So
                        Culbert, to you and the children we can't bring her back now, but by the Grace of God. we can go
                        where we feel she has gone. So children please make it as soon as you can. Sister Nancy's body
                        sleeps at Little Children's Home Church Cemetery, Laurel, Indiana.</p>

                    <p><strong>LILLIE THORNSBERRY:</strong></p>
                    <p>It is with great sorrow and grief we will try to write this obituary of our loving mother, Lillie
                        Thornsberry. She was born December 19, 1906 in Prestonsburg, Kentucky and died Nov- ember 13,
                        1979, making her stay on earth 72 years ten months and 12 days. She was a very good mother to us
                        and we loved her so much that words can not tell.</p>
                    <p>She has left behind to mourn her loss; three daughters Mary Alice Hall, Maggie Hicks, and Ethel
                        Risner, all of Willard, Ohio and her husband Joe Thornsberry and six step-children, Mrs. Marvis
                        Tackett of Plymouth; Howard Thornsberry of Cleve- land, and Alvin of Detroit, Michigan. She also
                        had 19 grand- children, 25 great-grandchildren 28 step-grandchildren and three step
                        great-grandchildren. She had one sister left to bear her grief- Osie Ousley of Stockbridge,
                        Michigan and a host of friends and relatives.</p>
                    <p>She was preceeded in death by her first husband, Raymond Ousley, who died March 3, 1957 and two
                        sons Curtis Ousley who died April 9, 1969 and Warren Ousley who died December 9, 1978. Also she
                        has lost five brothers and sisters and a mother and father most surely someone will be waiting
                        for her up there in Heaven, but most of all, Jesus our Lord and Savior. Mom had been a member of
                        the Little Rebecca Church since May 1969.</p>

                    <p><strong>EARL HALL:</strong></p>
                    <p>By request of the family, with sadnessin my heart, I will try to write an obituary of my beloved
                        brother Earl Hall. He was born at Etty, Pike County, Kentucky, November 4, 1917 and departed
                        from this life August 1, 1979, making his stay on earth 61 years. nine months and four days. He
                        was the son of the late James Ellis and Judy Bentley Hall.</p>
                    <p>In early life, he was married to Leona Mullins. To this union were born ten children. Sister
                        Leona and Little Hubert and Betty preceeded him in death. He later married Shirley Syck. To this
                        union were born two children. Other than his wife he leaves to mourn six sons - Hurston of
                        Paintsville, Kentucky; Eugene and Roger, both of Greysville, Alabama; Marvin of Ypsilanti,
                        Michigan; Earl Kent and Jason both of Trenton, Michigan; four daughters - Dean Mullins of
                        Vinton, Ohio, Janice Mullins of Bidwell, Ohio, Gwen Skinner of Greysville, Alabama and Rhonda
                        Gulyban of River View, Michigan. 20 grandchildren six great grandchildren, two brothers Milford
                        of Dorton, Kentucky and Leonard of River Rouge, Michigan; one sister Draxie Tackett of Thurman,
                        Ohio and a host of friends and relatives survive.</p>
                    <p>He spent his working years, 21 years as a coal miner before going to the steel industry at
                        McClouth Steel Corp. in Trenton, Michigan where he worked 20 years. He joined the Old Regular
                        Baptist Church 21 years ago. For many years, he had his letter at the Little Pearl Church at
                        Vinton, Ohio.</p>
                    <p>The last years of his life he sufferedvery much. He bore his afflictions with patience until the
                        end. The pale horse and his rider came by that August evening at 7:10 p.m. at the Seaway
                        Hospital in Trenton, Michigan. I will always remember the wonderful talks I had with him the
                        last few months of life. He was umble.</p>
                    <p>We all miss him very much. His happy smiles and loving voicewill never greet us in this world
                        anymore. Brother Earl has gone home to die no more over on Canaan's Happy Shore. With Jesus from
                        Galilee in that Kingdom that has no end. Where no sorrows ever come. Many seasons may come and
                        time will pass away. He will rise on that great Judgement morning.</p>
