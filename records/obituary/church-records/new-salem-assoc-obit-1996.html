					<p>In loving memory of a dear husband and father, Evan Dewey Adkins. He was born November 3, 1924
						and passed away March 21, 1996, making his stay on earth 71 years, 4 months, and 18 days. He was
						born at Galveston, Ky. to the late Willie and Nancy Jane Akers Adkins. He was a retired coal
						miner and construction worker. He was a World War II veteran and received the American Theater,
						EAME Theater with four Bronze stars-good conduct and victory medal while serving his country. He
						joined the Pilgrim's Home Old Regular Baptist Church at Grethel. He was never baptized because
						of his illness. He loved to hear the Regular Baptist Ministers preach and sing. His favorite
						song was, "Gone Away With A Friend. " On March 1, 1946, he married Goldie Evans Adkins. We spent
						fifty happy years together and were as close as two people could be. We have eight children,
						Girdell, George, Phillip Dale, Earl, Clara Lou, Michael, Mary Ann, and Patty Sue. He was a
						loving father and was always there when his children needed him. He always enjoyed sitting on
						the porch and visiting with family and friends. He never met a stranger. When he got sick his
						neighbors, friends, and church members all visited every chance they got. His family was always
						so good about staying with him. The family always made sure someone was with him at all times.
						He was well-liked by all who knew him. Besides his wife and children, he leaves 25 grandchildren
						and 21 great-grandchildren, one brother, Lee Adkins of Napponee, Indiana, two sisters, Minnie
						Rogers of Harold, Ky., and Melba Macabee of Michigan, and a host of family and friends to mourn
						his passing. Our loss is Heaven's gain. Daddy we all love and miss you so much.</p>

					<p><strong>GRANT DAVIS AKERS [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>Grant Davis Akers, son of the late James Akers and Nancy Tackett Akers was born March 28, 1932,
						and deceased Sept. 26, 1996. His stay on earth was 64 years 5 months and 29 days. He was married
						to Wanda Lee Hall on April 29, 1952 at the home of her parents Cleveland and Virchus Hall, by
						Elder Mahlon Burke all of Jonancy, Ky. To this union were born two daughters, Lou Ann and Sheryl
						Kaye. Grant leaves to mourn his loss his loving and devoted wife, Wanda; one daughter, Lou Ann
						Bentley, and her husband, Herbert Bentley; one granddaughter, Tara Ann Burke, and her husband
						David Burke; one grandson, Christopher Bentley, and one great-granddaughter, Chelsea Ann Burke.
						She was a special rose in his life. His daughter, Sheryl, preceded him in death. He also leaves
						four brothers who will miss him: Dewey, Luther, Charlie, and Otis, all of Dorton, Ky; one
						brother, Noah, preceded him in death. He leaves two sisters, Lucille Estep of Dorton, Ky. and
						Gladys Carico of Fort Blackmore, Virginia. Three sisters have preceded him in death. They were
						Romadale Bennett, Lissie Flanary, and Nicie Younce. He also leaves a host of relatives and
						friends to mourn his loss. At birth in 1932 he was welcomed by natural parents, but much more
						important than that was his birth some time before he joined the Old Union Church of Regular
						Baptist on September 10, 1983. We feel he was welcomed by Jesus and all the saints of Heaven. He
						was a member of Little Robinson Creek Church of Old Regular Baptist when he deceased.</p>

					<p><strong>LAURA AKERS</strong> [Photo Not Available]</p>
					<p>With much sadness and broken heart that we try to write an obituary of our beloved mother, Laura
						Akers. She was born November 13, 1912 at Grethel, Ky. She was the daughter of Solman and Mary
						Hamilton Akers. Later in life she met and married Carl Akers also of Grethel and to this union
						were born five children: Hugh Winston Akers of Grethel, KY, Janet Sue Spears of Southpoint,
						Ohio, Eugene, Carlos, and Lowell Keith all of Harold, Ky.. She also leaves behind two brothers
						Andy Akers of Jackson, Ohio, Lee Akers of Grethel, Ky., and four sisters, Sally Frasure of
						Flatwoods, Ky., Francis Hamilton of Ashland, Ohio, Annie Keathly of Morehead, Ky, and Vickie
						Martin of Benbrook, TX, and she also leaves behind nine grand children and thirteen great grand
						children. Laura (Mom) joined the Old Regular Baptist Church the third Sunday in August, 1968,
						was baptized by Elders Milford Adams and Aurther Hamilton. She took her membership at the
						Pilgrims Home Church were she was a faithful member until her death. There is a vacant seat at
						the Pilgrims Home Church, but not in our heart for this beloved sister and mother. Mom showed us
						how much she loved us and we know that she would want us to love and to take care of each other
						now that she is gone. To many friends and relatives we say to remember the word in reve</p>

					<p><strong>VIRGINIA FAYE AKERS</strong> [Photo Not Available]</p>
					<p>With the help of the Lord and a heavy heart, we will write this obituary of our beloved sister,
						wife, mother and grandmother. Virginia Faye Akers, a homemaker, was born in Pike County,
						Kentucky, July 25, 1948, the daughter of Walter Wright of Dorton and the late Betty Quesenberry
						Wright. Jenny joined the Caney Creek Old Regular Baptist Church in March of 1980, and remained a
						faithful member until her death. She passed this life on November 29, 1995, making her stay on
						earth 47 years, 4 months, and 4 days. She was married January 18, 1969 to Bruce Akers and to
						this union were born one son, Walter Thomas Akers, and two daughters, Cathy Sue Akers and Lucy
						Renee Akers, who preceded her in death in 1976. Jenny is survived by her husband, Bruce Akers of
						Caney; her son, Walter Thomas Akers; and her daughter, Cathy Sue Akers; two granddaughters,

						and sacrificed herself to help others. Her light shone so brightly and in her death shines
						brighter still. She left a light in the window and piled up a few stones along the way to guide
						her loved ones home. Though our hearts are broken and our eyes are filled with tears, we truly
						believe she's with her mother and her daughter, Lucy in Heaven. Surely our loss is Heaven's
						gain. We miss her So much and hope to meet again some glad and glorious morning, resting in
						peace. Written by her broken-hearted family. We love you, Jenny</p>

					<p><strong>DOLLY MARIE ALEXANDER [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>With saddened hearts we will, with the help of the Lord and our family try to write this obituary
						of our dear mother. Dolly Marie Alexander was born in Adams County on August 31, 1928 and passed
						from this life on May 25, 1996 at her home after a long illness, making her stay on this earth
						67 years, 8 months and 24 days. She was preceded in death by her father, Oren Talbert Blair; her
						mother Glenna Marie (Case) Bartlett; her husband, Carl Alexander; her sister, Mary Dorothy
						Blair; and her brother, William Edward Blair. She is also survived by four children: William
						Tong of Lynchburg, OH, Randy Tong of Port William, OH; Roger Tong of Peebles OH; and Sue Bosier
						of Hillsboro, OH; two brothers, Oren Blair Jr. of Elmville OH; and Gene Bartlett of
						Martinsville, OH.; 11 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren. Mom was always so active and
						enjoyed life to its fullest. When Mom would be playing with the grandchildren she was as one of
						them, always full of energy and vitality. Mom was a very good-hearted lady, who knew no
						strangers, and fed everybody who walked in her house. Mom was not a selfish person and she
						always worried about everyone but herself. But then Mom was stricken with cancer. Before she had
						her operation I had one of the most serious talks with her. I asked her that if her life would
						end that night, where would her eternal home be? Heaven or Hell? She said that she had been
						praying and knew that her home in Heaven was a better home to go to when she left this old
						sinful world. After this, our conversations were always on Jesus and how Heaven would be when
						she got there. Every time the family would gather together, she always wanted us to sing her
						some old songs of Zion and hold prayer. This past year I became closer to Mom than I ever have.
						Mom told us she wanted to see us all in Heaven someday. We know that she has gone home to be
						with Jesus, and she will be loved and missed by all. Some have said if God ever put an angel
						here, it was Dolly.</p>

					<p><strong>CORA MULLINS AMBURGEY [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>Cora was born February 21, 1931. She departed this life April 26, 1996, making her stay here on
						earth 65 years, 2 months and 3 days. Cora was born in the home of the late Herman Mullins and
						Callie Stacy Mullins. Early in life she met and married John D. Amburgey, who preceded her in
						death 11 years ago. To this union were born 6 children, 1 son - Alonzo Amburgey, Indianapolis,
						IN and 5 daughters - Lawana Thornsberry, Redfox, KY., Jonnie Dale Wright, Isom, KY, Martha
						Amburgey, Mallie, KY, Betty Lou Thornsberry, Raven, KY and Mona Wakesha Sammons, Jeremiah, KY
						Cora had 7 grandchildren whom she loved So much. Cora is also survived by 3 brothers and 7
						sisters. Cora was so good to help take care of her loved ones. When they would get sick, she was
						always there to take care of them. She would leave her home to go and take care of other people.
						Cora has lived a lonely life since J.D.'s passing away. Her children have always been so good to
						visit and help all they could. Cora was always an easy-going woman. She always had a smile for
						everyone she met. Cora never believed in anything fancy. She was plain and old-fashioned. She
						reminds me of the virtuous woman the Bible speaks about. She was just a genuine person. Cora
						never did join any church but by the life she lived and the love she had for everybody she gives
						us reason to think she is in Heaven today. Her soul is resting around the throne of God waiting
						for the redemption of the body. I would like to say to her children that, if you want to see
						Mommy again, you will have to fall out with sin while you live here on earth. If Mommy could
						speak back to you, she would tell you that she is safe at home where she doesn't have to suffer
						any more. Be good to one another and meet Mommy in Heaven where we won't have to part anymore.

					<p>When I was first asked to write the obituary of my granddaddy, Clarence Bates, I wasn't sure I'd
						be able to. But with tears in my eyes and love and fond memories in my heart, I'll do my best.
						Granddaddy was born on April 20, 1901 to Joseph and Mary Alice Vanover Bates. He died on July
						23, 1996 at Hazard Appalachian Regional Hospital after a long battle with Alzheimer's Disease.
						His stay on this earth was 95 years, 3 months and 3 days. He leaves behind to mourn his death,
						his two sons and daughters-in-law, Hollis and Georgia Bates of Pinetop, Ky and Landis Douglas
						and Judy Bates of Garrettsville, OH. Also five daughters and three sons-in-law, Beulah Slone of
						Munster, IN, Cornelia Baker of Pinetop, KY, Wilma Jean and Winford Thomas of Cundiff, KY, Olma
						Faye, Robert Pratt, Eula Fern and L.C. Slone, all of Pinetop, KY; and one sister, Flara
						Thornsberry of Melvin, KY. Granddaddy also leaves 35 grandchildren, 38 great-grandchildren, and
						7 great- great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his wife Dorthea Mullins Bates and two
						sons, Willis and Philis Ray Bates. To everyone he met he was "Granddaddy." His overalls, his
						flowers, his apple trees and his honey bees were his most prized possessions. Some time ago,
						Granddaddy professed that the Lord had saved him and I feel in my heart that he is in Heaven.

					<p><strong>JIMMY DARRELL BATES [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>Jimmy was the first of eleven children, born to Greeley and Verna Wright Bates. He was born at
						Millstone, KY, January 11, 1946. He moved with his family to Winchester, Indiana in the winter
						of 1963. He and brother Paul were taking Daddy to work, when they were struck by a drunk driver,
						on June 7, 1965. Jimmy passed from this life on June 9, 1965 at Randolph County Hospital, in
						Winchester, IN. He was survived by his parents, as well as four grandparents-Elder Andy and
						Zettie Johnson Bates of Roxana KY and Willie and Ardelia Sanders Wright of Thorton, KY; six
						brothers: Paul Eugene, of United States Marine Corp., John Morgan, Danny Wayne, Greeley Junior,
						Tommy Kaye and Charles Kermit; four sisters: Geneva Gail, Dewana Vondale, Fleda Delana and
						Fernie June, all of Winchester, IN; as well as a host of uncles, aunts and cousins.</p>

					<p><strong>TOMMY KAYE BATES&nbsp; [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>Tommy was the seventh of eleven children born to Greeley and Verna Wright Bates. He was born in
						Whitesburg, KY on April 16, 1957. He moved with his family to Winchester, IN, in the winter of
						1963. After a year long battle with colon cancer, Tommy passed from this life, on July 17, 1996,
						at Randolph County Hospital, in Winchester, IN. He was preceded in death by three grandparents:
						Elder Andy Bates of Roxana, KY, Willie and Ardelia Sanders Wright of Thorton KY He was survived
						by his parents, as well as one grandparent, Zettie Johnson Bates. Also surviving are five
						brothers: Paul Eugene of Nashville IN; Johnny Morgan of Portland, IN; Danny Wayne, Greeley
						Junior and Charles Kermit, all of Winchester, IN; four sisters: Geneva Gail Berry, Dewana
						Vondale Feltis, Fleda Delana Sexton and Fernie June Hall, all of Winchester, IN; four
						brothers-in-law; three sisters-in-law; nineteen nieces and nephews; fourteen great-nieces and
						nephews; and an abundant number of uncles, aunts and cousins. Above you have read the obituaries
						of two of our brothers. The simple words written here can never give expression to how much we
						loved and will miss them. It has been a great comfort to our brokenhearted parents to know that
						three months before his death Tommy gave his life to God. Also, I would like to note that after
						Jimmy's death, Mommy had a dream; she was sitting on the porch and Jimmy came down in front of
						her, his feet didn't touch the earth. She reached to hug him near her but was stopped when he
						said, "Don't touch me, Mommy I ain't been to the Lord yet." God tells us many things through our
						dreams and it is our hearts' biggest hope that Jimmy is resting with Tommy at God's feet.

					<p><strong>VENCE BATES [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>With the help of the Lord I will try to write the obituary of my beloved husband, Vence Bates. He
						was born June 25,1920 in Knott County, Kentucky, the son of the late Wilson and Zettie (Hall)
						Bates. He departed this life here on earth July 5, 1996, making his stay here on earth 76 years
						and ten days. Vence and I were united in marriage April 1, 1944. Unto this union four children
						were born: one daughter, Ruby Joyce Kendrick of Melvin Kentucky; three sons: Fossil Bates of
						Zionsville Indiana, Roland Bates of Omaha, Nebraska; and Larry Bates of Greenwood, Indiana. Also
						left to mourn his departure are nine grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren; two brothers,
						Edward Bates of Middletown Ohio, and James Bates of Dry Creek, Kentucky; two sisters, Edna Hunt
						of Jeffersoville Indiana, and Ollie Mosley of Topmost, Kentucky . My husband had many friends.
						He loved all who knew him. He helped anybody he could who was in need. He had a deep love for
						children. I miss him so much. I loved him with all my heart. Sometimes I think I can't go on
						with out him. Vence lived eight months after the doctors told him he had cancer. He endured his
						illness well. Vence was a member of the United Mine Workers of America, he was a faithful member
						of Local Union 5899 for over fifty years. He also was a member of the Joppa Old Regular Baptist
						Church. He joined the Church on Feb. 27, 1996 and was baptized that day. I do believe that was
						the happiest day of his life. He told us all never to worry about him he had a better place to
						go to. He hoped to meet us all there some sweet day. Written by his wife, Hesta Bates</p>

					<p><strong>Dova Terry Bentley [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>Proverbs 31:28 Her children arise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
						It is with much sadness and humbleness that we write the obituary of a dedicated, loving wife
						and mother, Dova Terry Bentley. Dova Terry was born December 5,1913 at Raven Kentucky, the child
						of the late Samuel and Ruthie Reynolds Terry. She passed away on her birthday, December 5, 1995.
						When she was seventeen years old, Mom married the love of her life, the late Robert Hamilton
						Bentley, Jr. Mom and Dad were married at Lackey, Kentucky and they were happily married for
						fifty-six years. To this union were born ten children: Clyde Bentley, of Mt. Dora, Florida;
						Glenna Cook of Topmost, KY; Gert Martin of Umatilla, Florida; Betty Bentley and Sammy Bentley of
						Wayland, KY; Bert Bentley of Cleveland, Ohio; Bruce Bentley of Brunswick, Ohio; Charlotte Joseph
						of Prestonsburg, KY; David Bentley of Abilene, Texas and Novella Froman of Pikeville. In
						addition, she has left twenty-four grandchildren and thirty-six great-grandchildren, as well as
						daughters- and sons-in-law that dearly miss her. Also surviving to mourn her loss are her
						sisters, brother and sister-in-law as follows: Elizabeth Caudill, of Melvin; Augusta Stanley,
						Beatrice Boyd and Clearance Terry, all of Sandusky, Ohio; Clova Watkins of Lackey, Ky and Lanie
						Terry of Estill, KY Mom was a wonderful, giving, sacrificing Mother and great cook. These words
						seem to fall short in describing her. Everyone was made welcome to her home and she took great
						joy in cooking for her family, friends and visitors. Mom was, first and foremost, Mom to her
						children. She loved for them to come home; her family was her life. During her illness, Mom's
						attitude was a great inspiration. Mom had cancer and she said, "It's just one of those things,
						everybody had to die. It's just my time." She had such dignity during this trying time. Mom
						never got over losing Dad and is now in Heaven with him where they are having a wonderful
						reunion. If Mom could talk to us now, she would simply say, "Get ready to meet us in Heaven." We
						miss her so much. Like when King David lost his son, he said, according to II Samuel 12:22 & 23:
						" . . . while the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, who can tell whether God
						will be gracious to me, that the child may live? But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?
						Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me." We can all get
						ready to meet the Lord and we can have a big family reunion in Heaven someday. Written by
						Novella Bentley Froman and Gertude Bentley Martin</p>

					<p><strong>DOROTHY COMPTON BILLITER&nbsp; [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>Dorothy Compton Billiter, daughter of the late Jim and Della Compton, was born July 10, 1916, at
						Yeager, KY. She passed away October 20,1995 in East Liverpool, OH. She was also preceded in
						death by her husband Sherl Edward Billiter, and one brother Willie Lee Compton. Survivors are a
						son, Larry Edward Billiter, East Liverpool, OH, and a daughter, Lena Faye Guysinger, Akron, OH,
						seven grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. After completing college, Dorothy taught school
						several years. When her husband passed away she moved to Ohio to be near her children, and
						worked as a sales manager there. Dorothy was a devoted mother and grandmother. She always had
						time for a game with a nephew, school event with a grandchild, or an afternoon babysitting a
						great-grandchild. Dorothy had a lot of love to share and she shared it every day. She loved her
						husband Ed, and loved her children. She began her life in the church when her son was six years
						old. He was seriously ill and she prayed that if he would live, she would dedicate her life to
						the Lord. She kept her promise and spent the rest of her days as a faithful member of the Old
						Regular Baptist Church. She enjoyed reading the Bible and read it completely through many times.
						Through a long illness, her faith never wavered and she bore her pain uncomplaining. She loved
						her parents and sisters and brothers, and there are so many pleasant memories of the early years
						when all eight children were together. In later years when the sisters and brothers married and
						some, like Dorothy, moved away, they all continued to stay close and gather together each year.
						Dorothy especially loved these times and though she can no longer be with us, in days to come
						when the family gathers, her love and laughter will be remembered. Since the writing of this
						obituary, Dorothy's only daughter, Lena Faye passed away May 25, 1996, and is buried beside her
						mother and father on the Compton cemetery at Collins.</p>

					<p>Jesse Blair, Jr. was born February 15,1946 in Floyd County at Melvin, Ky., in the home of the
						late Jesse and Ella Hall Blair. He passed from this life May 3, 1996 in Belleville, Michigan,
						making his stay on earth 50 years, two months and 22 days. On March 22, 1969 he was joined in
						marriage to Phyllis Marie Slone of Garner, Ky. They have three children who survive him: Dawn
						Renee Johnson of Kite, Ky., Deanna Marie Blair of Belleville, Michigan and Darrin Lyle Blair of
						Belleville, Michigan, and one granddaughter, Jacinda Brooke Johnson of Kite, KY. He is also
						survived by one brother, Patrick Blair of Kite, KY; four sisters: Revel Archey of Delaware, OH.;
						Janice Hall of Kite, KY.; Annette Hall of Dema, KY.; and Gledia Todd of Crab Orchard, KY; and a
						great host of nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by two sisters, Hermie Childers and
						Eula Brummett. He was the sixth child and the first son. He was called Buddy Boy from the
						beginning of life. As he grew older it was changed to Bud. After graduating from Knott County
						High School at Pippa Passes, KY, he began working for Ford Motor Company, the Wayne Truck Plant
						in Wayne, Michigan., where he retired in 1995. In November of 1965, he was drafted into the
						Armed Services and served two years in the U.S. Army. He was a member of the United Auto
						Worker's Union of America. God loaned him to us for loving and caring for 50 years and the
						memories are ours to keep. Although, quietly in the night death came, but if Bud met Jesus, he
						is shouting down those golden streets. To his children; Dawn, long distance is sometimes the
						best way to say, "I love you," Deanna, strength comes in small packages sometimes, Darrin,
						things that are taught to us when we are young are the strongest of all. So like the song, just
						hold on to Jesus and ride out the storm. Written by his wife, Phyllis Marie Blair and sister,

					<p><strong>ALEX BOYD&nbsp; [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>It is with sadness, yet a thankful heart and with the help and grace of God, that I will try to
						write an obituary for Alex Boyd (Poppy). Poppy was born October 22, 1914 in Pike County
						Kentucky, the son of Lee Boyd and Lue Crisp Boyd. He was the ninth of 14 children. He spent the
						early part of his life on earth in southeastern Kentucky. He meet and married Hazel Conn Jarrell
						Boyd on February 27, 1940 and took three young girls as his own. They were blessed with a
						daughter, Georgene. Poppy was a veteran of World War II, entering the U.S. Army on January 30,
						1941. He was there at the battle of Normandy, at the Rhineland, and the Campaign of Northern
						France. Among his decorations and citations were three Bronze Stars, American Defence Service
						Metal and Purple Heart. He was a lifetime member of the Disabled American Veterans. Poppy worked
						as a coal miner and a carpenter, building houses, bridges and dams. He was a member of Carpenter
						Local #23. After a long and trying illness Poppy passed this earth February 11, 1996, leaving
						this earth a better place for him having been here. Those left to mourn his passing are his
						wife, Hazel Conn Jarrell Boyd, who was there with him till the end; daughter, Georgene Wright,
						who will never forget her Daddy's love; daughters Emogene Boyd, Lillian Boyd and Burlene Neal,
						who thank God Granny found Poppy to be their father, and they know how he loved them. He leaves
						brothers, Henry, Luther and John Boyd. They will never get to go squirrel hunting or ginsinging
						with him on this earth again. He also leaves sisters: Goldie Conn, Mary Jarrell, Lassie Hart,
						Minnie Crisp and Claudla Manhart, who will miss a brother's love. He leaves 15 grandchildren,
						who are better people for having had Poppy; 36 greatgrandchildren; 14 great-great-grandchildren;
						who will lose, for they will not have had the chance to know Poppy. He also leaves a great
						number of nieces and nephews whom he loved, and they in turn loved him. Also many many friends.
						Poppy enjoyed going to church and had a great belief in God. Although he never attached himself
						to any church, his desire was to be kept the last few days and nights on earth at the Little
						Salem Old Regular Baptist Church. This leaves me to believe that our loss is Heaven's gain.
						Poppy we love and miss you. Written by a broken-hearted grandson, Billis Boyd</p>

						encouragement from her perserverance, as she suffered a number of serious illnesses, including
						cancer. From the beautiful life that she lived, all that knew and loved her should be comforted
						with the thought that our loss is truly Heaven's gain. The memories of her kind heart and sweet
						spirit will be written upon the hearts of those she left behind, for generations to come.</p>

						surviving are his 91-year-old mother, 1 son-in-law, 4 brothers, 4 sisters, and a host of friends
						and relatives to mourn his death. His father and one sister preceded him in death. At the age of
						36 years he surrendered his heart to Jesus. On the second Sunday in July, 1958, while down on
						his knees in our home, he felt the Lord saved his soul. He was so happy! On Saturday, October 1,
						1958, he gave his hand to become a member of the Hayes Branch United Baptist Church and was
						baptized on Sunday. He was a faithful member for 28 years and served there as a deacon for 20
						years. At the time of his death he was a member of the Mt. Sterling Old Regular Baptist Church,
						where he served as a deacon for 9 years. Hiram truly loved the Lord and the old-time Baptist
						way. He loved all the old songs. Some of his favorite ones were "I Love My Savior God Because He
						First Loved Me," "Amazing Grace," and "How I Come to Love These Pilgrims." He told us many times
						that when the good Lord called he was ready to go and that he was not afraid to die. Shortly
						before he left us, he tried to tell me something. I said, "Honey, I didn't understand you. What
						did you say?" In a low, calm voice he said, "You'd be surprised. you'd be surprised." I believe
						with all my heart that through spiritual eyes, he viewed his Heavenly home. Our home here is so
						lonely without him, but I feel for a surety that some sweet day we will meet where there will be
						no tears, pain, or sorrow. And, we will never again have to say, "good-bye." So, children,
						grandsons, brothers, sisters, and friends, if you haven't made peace with the Lord, his prayer
						would be, "Repent and be born again, and meet me in Heaven." Written in loving memory by his
						wife, Margie, and family</p>

					<p>I'm writing an obituary of my dear precious Mother: Clara Gladis Clark Bryant. She was the
						daughter of the late Joe Likens Sr. and Emma Hamilton Tackett. Mother was born on November 24,
						1921. She deceased this life on March 25, 1996 making her stay on this earth 74 years, 4 months
						and 1 day. Also deceased is her husband, Charlie Clark; mother, Emma Likens Tackett; brothers:
						Tolva Likens; Joe Jr. Likens; and Donald Tackett. Charlie Clark and Clara G. Likens were married
						on May 11, 1939. To this union were born ten children. Five sons: Milford Clark of Nova, Ohio,
						Tolva Clark and Charles R. Clark of Ashland, Ohio; Hillard Clark of Loudonville, Ohio; and Larry
						D. Clark of Sullivan, Ohio. Five daughters: Emma Lue Peppard of Nova, Ohio; Anna Sue Lilly and
						Jewell D. Arms of Shelby, Ohio; Pauline Tormaschy of Sanford, Florida; and Linda F. Pauley of
						Ocala, Florida. She also leaves behind 32 grandchildren; 23 great-grandchildren; 1 grandson
						deceased in 1959 and 1 great-granddaughter deceased in 1979. Mom joined the `Pilgrims Home'
						Church in Grethel, Ky. on July 19, 1951. Dad joined there on March 26, 1954 and was baptized on
						April 17, 1954. In 1955 Charlie and Clara moved to Nova, Ohio. They both moved their letters to
						the Little Pilgrims Home Church in Ruggles, Ohio. Dad and Mom named this church and were members
						there until they retired and moved to Ocala, Florida in September 1979. They then moved their
						letters to churches in Florida. Mom belonged to Mary Elizabeth in Hollister, Florida under Elder
						Hansford Short, Jr. Moderator. I recall Mom calling Brother Short "Little Boy." She loved
						singing and rejoicing the good old-fashioned Regular Baptist songs. Our hearts are so sad dened
						from the loss of our dear mother and loved ones who are gone to live with Jesus. Mom never met a
						stranger! Her smile and open arms were always open to express how much love and kindness she had
						for everyone. Mom and Dad taught us to love each other in so many different ways. They lived for
						Jesus through the good times and hard times. God was like a hammer pounding in their hearts that
						guided them throughout their lives. I deeply feel that my Mom and Dad both are together in
						Heaven. I had a vision that Mom is a angel with wings of gold. She met Daddy at the gate on
						March 25, 1996. Mom had an uncountable number of friends from everywhere. She loved to live,
						travel, and sing for her Lord for as long as I can remember. My dear mother was an inspiration
						to us all. She gave us love, advice, and prayed for all of her children, grandchildren and
						great-grandchildren. Mom loved her church, family, and friends. Daddy and Mommy left us all a
						large trail to follow!! I feel God blessed us with the greatest parents in the world. The
						memories are what we must cherish and treasure until we meet them again. If Mom and Dad could
						tell us, it would be this: "Children look up and follow us; we are safely home now with all of
						our loved ones, don't weep over us; we are rejoicing with Jesus; Take up the cross, dear little
						ones and follow Jesus, so Mom and Dad can meet you again someday." Spiritually, I know Mommy is
						in Heaven rejoicing. It's nature's flesh that we'll miss. Just remember to look up and give
						Jesus the praise for Mommy and Daddy are together forever. Our loss is Heaven's gain! Pray to
						God and live for Jesus. Sadly missed by her family and friends. God Bless All. Written by her
						baby daughter, Linda F. (Clark) Pauley</p>

					<p><strong>CALVIN C. BURKE [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with much sadness and a broken heart
						that Iwill try to write an obituary of my father, Calvin C. Burke. Dad was born december 8, 1924
						in Weeksbury Kentucky. The son of Boles and Lille Mae (Ray) Burke. He departed this life on July
						4, 1996., making his stay on this earth 71 years 6 months and 27 days. Dad married Bertha
						(Ramsey) Burke on January 16, 1945. Unto this union were born three children: two sons, C.
						Michael Burke of Huber Heights, Ohio, and Kenneth R. Burke of West Chester, Ohio; and one
						daughter, Dawn Rita Rider of Springfield, Ohio. The Lord blessed Dad with eight grandchildren
						and thirteen great-grandchildren. He also had four sisters, Edith Burns of Springfield, Ohio,
						Melissa Blevins of South Vienna, Ohio, Dorothy Grizzel of Hamilton, Ohio, and Dora Watson of
						Mildford, Ohio. He had a host of friends and family to mourn their loss. He was preceded in
						death by his loving wife and his parents. Dad's life was all about the Old Regular Baptist
						Church. He placed his membership over 45 years ago at the Enterprise Old Regular Baptist Church
						at Indian Creek, Kentucky. He joined the church in July of 1951. Because we moved to Ohio, Dad
						would travel to all the churches around Ohio. Where he went the most was Little Bethel. Dad
						never met a stranger; he would love to talk to anyone about the Lord who would listen. Dad would
						love to travel to all the Associations arid find out about all the churches. Dad had been sick
						for years, but the last year Dad went down real fast. In June the doctors told Dad he had
						cancer; it didn't stop his faith in his Lord. He said, " I can't give up," and he said, " I will
						be satisfied when the Lord's will is done, and not my will." Dad always wanted the Lord's will
						done and it was. He would love for the brothers and sisters of the church to come and visit him.
						Two nights before Dad died some of the brothers and sisters were sitting up with us and Dad's
						dear friend, Larry Dixon, sang "Gone Away With a Friend." Well, that is just what Dad did, he
						went away with his friend, Jesus. I believe the angels were in his room waiting till the Lord
						said, "No more suffering, bring my child home." If we are ever to see our daddy again, we to
						have to turn to the the Lord and wait until He calls us home. I am glad I had him for my father.
						He gave me lots of love and understanding, but most of all he showed me how to love and live for
						the Lord. I will always miss my daddy, but one day the Lord will call me home and there Iwill
						see my mother and father again. Written by his daughter, Dawn Rita Rider</p>

					<p><strong>ARIZONA MOORE FRAZIER CAUDILL [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>It is with a sad and aching heart that I will try to write the obituary of my beloved mother and
						sister in Christ, Arizona Moore Frazier Caudill. Mom passed on to that eternal home on April 21,
						1996. First, she was a Christian and a member of the Pilgrim's Rest Church of the Old Regular
						Baptist. She was born December 22, 1912, making her stay on this earth 89 years and four months.
						She was the daughter of the late Richard Moore and Hannah Gayhart Moore Adams. She was one of
						six children of whom three brothers and one sister preceded her in death. Only one sister
						remains, Wyoma Tackett. Mom had been in a nursing home for 14 months prior to her passing.
						Birdie was there daily to see her and attend to her needs, to prompt her to get out of bed and
						face a new day. Arizona was married to the late Armpie Lewis Frazier, December 24, 1929, and to
						this union was born two children, Rubin Delmas Frazier of Newport News, Virginia and Birdie
						Lucille Park of St. Petersburg, Florida. There were three grandchildren and nine
						great-grandchildren. Mom joined the Pilgrim's Rest Church of the Old Regular Baptist in April
						1933 and when she was able she faithfully filled her seat in her church and worshiped and
						praised her God in a way that only she could. The last time that I saw her, she told me, "I
						don't know why the Lord is leaving me here, I'm ready to go to meet my Savior." She loved the
						Lord. Mom was married to Lee Caudill on December 8, 1962 and they were faithful to each other
						and to the Lord and always worshiped together. She leaves one stepdaughter, Goldie Jones, to
						mourn her loss. Mom was always available to help those in need. She was often called upon to go
						and help with the sick and usually stayed there, forsaking all else, until that sickness was
						resolved. She was a nurse, a minister, a waiter and a servant and all other things that God had
						called her to be. She will be greatly missed and I pray that whoever reads this obituary will
						see her again in "that place not made by hands, eternal in the Heavens" because I'm sure that
						she is with the Lord shouting and praising Him as she once did when we attended church together.
						Jesus said, "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I
						go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
						receive you unto myself; that where I am, ye may be also." (John 14:2-3) Written by her son and

						retired from Clinton Massie School system, at the Clarksville School, where he was a custodian.
						He was a member of the Little Bethel Church of Sligo, Ohio, He had been an Old Regular Baptist
						member since 1937. The Little Bethel Church was his pride and joy, his life. He spent many, many
						hours crushing pop cans and saving Bob and Carl tapes, so that he could make money for the

					<p><strong>HIE CLICK&nbsp; [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>Oct. 2, 1903 - June 6, 1996 With much sadness and regret I will attempt to write an obituary of
						my grandpa, Hie Click. Grandpa was born October 2, 1903 to Ulysses (Doe) and Amanda Click. He
						spent the next 92 years, until his death, June 6, 1996, on the same creek where he was born. In
						early life at the age of 29, he met and married Myrtle Boyd Click on Jan 6, 1932. To this union
						were born 4 children N.D. Click, Fayetteville, North Carolina, Richard Click, Wabash, Indiana,
						Rubestene Akers, Martin, Kentucky and Lavone Conn who preceded him in death on April 15, 1986.
						Grandpa and Granny started their housekeeping in what was called "hard times," back when it was
						hard to make a dollar. He plowed fields, worked in the coal mines, laid pipe lines. worked on
						the W.PA., and his last employment was with the C & O Railroad. After the children were grown
						and moved away on their own, God saw fit to separate this union of 36 years. On November 20,
						1968, death caused a breach in this family by removing a faithful companion and mother. For the
						next 24 years Grandpa made his home with us. Not many grandchildren are as fortunate as us to be
						raised under the same roof as their grandparent. This will make giving him up that much harder
						because the closer the union the tighter the bond. Within this earthly union Grandpa leaves
						behind to mourn his passing, 3 children, 10 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren, and 6
						step-great grandchildren. But there is another union and a different bond called the "the grace
						of God." It was within this union and this bond that he confessed a hope and a willingness to
						follow the Lord into baptism. On August 28, 1993, at the age of 89, it was my privilege, with
						the help of Elder Bill Tackett, to lay him in the watery grave. His last months here were spent
						in declining health and a desire to go to a better world. He once said in the hospital, "I won't
						die till my time comes." When that time came his passing was as that of one just falling asleep.
						Death has once more caused a breach in this family. It once again brings mourning and sorrow as
						a constant reminder of God's judgment upon the transgression of the first man he made and upon
						all his descendants. But by the grace of God and the victory given us through his son Jesus
						Christ we shall all meet again in a world without end. Written by his grandson, Elder Glen Akers

					<p>This is in loving memory of our mother and grandmother, Lola Click, who passed away on September
						8 1995. Lola was born on May 11, 1906, in Hindman, Ky. She was the daughter of David and Margie
						Smith Parks. She had one sister, Leala Parks Terry of Garner, Ky, to whom she was extremely
						close When John Click, son of Ezekiel and Suzanne Amburgey Click, was 10 years old he spotted
						Lola across the playground at school and said to friends, "That's the girl I'm going to marry."
						After marriage John worked as a coal miner. Lola raised two daughters, a garden, canned and
						preserved food, and was a great cook. She made the most beautiful quilts that you can imagine.
						Lola was always there for her family and neighbors. She would give a hug or a word of
						encouragement. She would share the food they had or nurse a neighbor back to health. She was
						very loved and well respected. Baptized into the Old Regular Baptist Church, she was a member
						for 54 years. Lola and John were both deeply religious people. In later years, she had diabetes
						and became unable to care for herself. After John's death on February 11, 1991, she lived with
						her daughter Evelee, and very special son-in-law, Gene Dixon. She received wonderful care and we
						all feel this added many years to her life. We were blessed to have this precious person with us
						for 89 years. John and Lola were more than good people who worked hard and were well respected.
						They were the catalyst that held us together as a family, gave us strength, guidance, and most
						of all, gave us unconditional love. Now they are together in death, as in life, in Heaven, as on
						earth. Totally devoted to each other. Both will live in our memory and hearts forever. Lola is
						deeply missed by her sister, Leala Parks Terry; two daughters, Maxine Olson and Evelee Dixon.
						She is also survived by grandchildren: Brenda Olson Starsia, Randy Olson, David Dixon and

						Ross, Johnny Ross, Rick Brooks, Pam Brooks Updike, Jeff Coffey, Scott Coffey, and Jarrod

						friends. Sister Margaret was a very hard worker all through her life. She enjoyed raising a huge

						church friends. Sister Margaret was a great witness to her family and friends. It was indeed a
						great witness that her children never in their lives heard their mother raise her voice in anger

						Short Collins and Robert Collins, both of whom preceded him in death. On August 26,1955, Bennie
						was married to Dina Page of Whitesburg, Ky. To this union were born 2 daughters, Beverly Carol
						of Somerset and Gloria of Raven. One son, Jeffery Ray, preceded Bennie in death. His 2
						sons-in-law, Marcus Huff and Kenneth Slone, were loved by Bennie as his own children. His 3
						beloved grandchildren, Jason, Jennifer, and Jillian, like us, have lost a dear person in their
						lives. Daddy was a fair and just man who was loved and respected by all who knew him. He was a
						wonderful father who used kind words as a means of discipline with his children. On March the
						25, 1979, Bennie was baptized into the Providence Old Regular Baptist Church. We feel that it
						was one of the happiest days of Daddy's life. Bennie was preceded in death by his 3 brothers,
						Frank, C., and Isadore. He leaves 1 sister, Virgie Caudill of Kendalville, Ind. and a host of
						nieces, nephews, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law, and friends, as well as his Brothers and
						Sisters in the Church. God had a plan for Daddy. We, who watched his suffering didn't
						understand. I sometimes think God used Daddy to be an inspiration to others. He was so sick for
						many years, getting worse as time went by. We watched him suffer for so long and while he could
						still speak, he would call, "Jesus, Jesus" He never questioned, "Why me?" He just kept his faith
						and we feel that eternal rest with Jesus will be Daddy's reward. On December the 8, 1995, the
						angels came and took him home. Written by the Family of Bennie Collins</p>

					<p>If the Lord will help me I will try to write the obituary of my loving Mother, Lillie Marie Leedy
						Compton, who passed from this life and entered into eternal rest on Oct. 1, 1995 at Pikeville
						Methodist Hospital. It is so hard to write about someone you loved so much, someone you had been
						with all your life. With the help of the Lord all things are possible. Our Mother was the oldest
						child born to William "Bill" Leedy and Elsie Bray Leedy. Mom was born March 6, 1913. She was 82
						years. and 7 months old at her passing. I miss Mom so much, the old home place is so lonesome,
						but we have good memories and the help of the Lord to help us along. The last words she said to
						me "I'll see you in the morning; don't worry about me I'm all right". I believe I'll see her in
						the morning and I do believe she is all right. Mom was a member of the Island Creek Old Regular
						Baptist Church for over 50 years. She loved the Church and her Brothers and Sisters very much.
						At a young age Mom was married to our Dad, Georgie Compton. They married July 16, 1932. Dad
						passed away Feb. 23, 1975, at the young age of 66 years. Mom and Dad were blessed with four
						children, two daughters, Emilee Justice, Island Creek, Pikeville, Ky. and Patty Canupp,
						Columbus, Ohio; two sons, Cecil Compton, Ann Arbor, Mich. J.B. Compton, Island Creek, Pikeville,
						Ky. She also left seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. One great-grandchild
						preceded her in death, and two step-great-grandchildren. Mom also left three sisters: Maxie
						Reynolds Venore, Tennessee; Cleo Thomas Ypsilanti, Mich.; and Helena Justice, Betsy Layne, Ky.,
						and two brothers, Henry Leedy, Ashland, Ky. and Edward Leedy, Betsy Layne, Ky. After Mom passed
						away I was going through some of her things. I found this card she had gotten from my brother
						for Mother's Day. She had written on the envelope. "To be read at my funeral, it is for all
						children;" I didn't find it until after her funeral so I am putting it in her obituary. What
						Mothers Mean To Me Mothers means the memories, and thoughts I'll always treasure of happy
						childhood days gone by and joy beyond all measure. Mothers mean a special smile and tender
						loving care, good advise and a listening ear when I have thoughts to share. Mothers means the
						magic touch that makes a happy home, and loving thoughts that follow me whereever I may roam
						Mothers mean a lot of things that words cannot define. When she's the wonderful Mother I'm so
						lucky to call mine. Written for the family with much love in my heart for everyone of you. Let's
						all put our trust in the Lord, and let him lead us, so we can all meet Mom in Heaven some day.

						daughter survive him, James M. Conley and Lema Sue Gibson of Mousie, Kentucky, and Leonard
						Conley of Fort Wayne, Indiana; ten grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. He had three
						brothers and three sisters that survive him: Marion (Huger) Conley, Melvin Conley, Lillie Green
						And Hester Scott, all of Mousie, Kentucky.; Merritt Conley and Beatrice Collins of Mcguffy,
						Ohio, and a host of friends and family. He loved his family very much, and would help anyone in
						anyway he could. He worked all his life in the underground coal mines, and was a retired UMWA
						coal miner of local union number 1745, of which he was very proud to be a part. He repented on
						April 22, 1994, but wasn't able to be baptized in the Old Regular Baptist Church until September
						18, 1994 due to his health, and continuous hospital stays. When Jesus comes back, we will be
						with our husband and daddy again, never to be parted. Your loving wife and children</p>

					<p><strong>ROSA COLE [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>The blessings of the Lord are manifested in countless ways - not the least of which is a kind,
						gentle, and loving mother and grandmother. Rosa Cole was truly such a blessing to all who knew
						her. Through her actions, Mamaw was a wonderful mother, grandmother, wife, neighbor, friend and
						Christian. A selfless and generous person, Mamaw cherished every moment with her family and was
						always willing to help others. Her sharp wit and keen sense of humor were refreshing and often
						surprising and made our time with her even more enjoyable. She was able to maintain her good
						spirits even in time of sickness. She loved to read her Bible and attend church. Although on
						many occasions she was not physically well, she made the extra effort to be in the Lord's house.
						Surely the Lord has blessed her faithfulness. We believe that Mamaw is victorious over death
						today. If we could hear her speak to us, I believe she would lovingly tell us to rejoice for her
						victory and that she will never experience any more pain or suffering. Truly, our loss is
						Heaven's gain. We hope and pray to be reunited with her. She was born on March 1, 1911, to the
						late Wilburn and Tannie Johnson Brown. On June 3, 1996, she departed her earthly life to enter
						into paradise with the Lord. In addition to her parents and her husband, Dave, Rosa was
						predeceased by a brother, Northern Brown, and two grandchildren, Timothy Damron and Teresa
						Newsom. She is survived by two daughters, Bernice King and Loretta Newsom, and one son, Ralph
						Cole, all of Robinson Creek, Kentucky; one sister, Vassie Flanery of Robinson Creek, Kentucky;
						and four brothers: Alvin Brown of Robinson Creek, Kentucky, Ballard Brown of Columbus, Ohio,
						Johnny Brown of Louisa, Kentucky, and Russell Brown of Virgie, Kentucky; six grandchildren and
						eight great-grandchildren. Let us never forget what Mamaw meant to us and always hold our
						memories of her in a special place in our hearts. Written by her grandson, David R. Hall</p>

					<p>With a sad and broken heart, I will try to write this obituary of my loving husband, Hezzie Crum.
						Born August 14, 1916, the son of Kenner Crum and Emely Mulkey Crum. He is preceded in death by
						his dad, mother, one sister and two brothers. He departed this life on June 11, 1996 at his
						home. Left to mourn their loss are his wife, Sylvia; one stepson, Marvin; one
						step-daughter-in-law Lynda; two step- granddaughters; and one step-grandson. He loved them all
						as his very own and always gave them good advise. He leaves three half-sisters, five
						half-brothers and a host of nieces and nephews. It pleased him when any of them came to see him
						at least once a year. Hezzie became a member of the Cold Spring Old Regular Baptist Church. He
						always rushed me to get started when the third Saturday and Sunday of each month came. He wanted
						to fill his seat as long as he was able. He enjoyed hearing good preaching and singing. When we
						got back home, he would say, "We had a good meeting today." My home is so lonesome here on earth
						without him. I feel with all my heart that I'll be with him some sweet day where we won't have
						to part anymore. He has left a shining light for all the family to follow and love one another.

					<p><strong>ELDER TILTON DYE [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>With great love, wonderful memories, a broken heart, and with the help of our almighty God, I
						will try to write this precious obituary of my loving brother. Tilton was a loving husband,
						devoted father to both his children and grandchildren, a son to his father and mother, as well
						as to his father-in-law and mother-in-law, a brother to his brothers and sisters, his
						brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, an uncle to a host of nieces and nephews, a friend to those
						that needed a friend and above all, I do believe, a son with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ
						This loving son was born at Price, Kentucky, February 10, 1941 to Woodrow and Monnie Brown Dye.
						He died September 19, 1996, at The Veterans' Hospital in Lexington, KY, making his stay on God's
						footstool fifty-five years, seven months and nine days. Tilton enlisted in the United States
						Army the summer of 1962. After training, he was sent to Vietnam where he served with honor and
						received the Air Metal with Oak Leaf Cluster. He is survived by his wife of thirty-two years,
						Maxine Stumbo Dye, Price, KY; two daughters, Shelly Marie (Michael) Newman, Lexington, KY,
						Angela Renee (Kevin) Spurlock, Price, KY; his parents, Woodrow and Monnie Brown Dye, Printer,
						KY; brothers: Milton of Columbus, Ohio; Andy of Printer, KY; Litton (Jimmy) of Price, KY; and
						Ricky of Lexington, Ky; sisters: Freda Goins, Gleda Johnson and Lucy Reynolds all of Printer,
						KY; three grandchildren: Tilton Kyle, Trenton Michael, and Hannah Sheree, and a host of nieces
						and nephews. On the fourth Saturday of June 1968, at Little Nancy Church, there was rejoicing in
						Heaven, when Tilton and Mom gave their hands to the Church. Dad and Elder Matt Justice baptized
						them the next day. Sometime later Tilton felt another calling from his Lord and Savior to go
						preach the gospel - and was ordained as a minister on March 24, 1973. Tilton took his calling
						seriously and cast his lot faithfully. Later, Tilton and Mom came to be with Dad at the
						Pilgrim's Rest Church where he was a faithful member to the end. In closing I would like to say
						to Maxine, Shelly, and Angela, "If you want to see Tilton again, you can, but you will have to
						go the way he did and that is through Jesus Christ." I would like to say Dad, "No, you don't
						have Tilton to walk with you and talk to you on this side of the Jordan River, but on the other
						side in the Promised Land, we will see him as an Angel of God." Mom, you won't have to ask
						Tilton to rest now, he's at rest. May God continue to comfort us. Written by his brother, Milton

					<p>With much sadness and a broken heart we will try to write an obituary of a loving husband, father
						and grandfather, Kendall Evans. He was born October 24, 1932 to the late John B. and Betty
						Howell Evans. On December 31, 1955 he married Sylvia Tackett Evans. To this union were born 4
						children: Marcella Newsome of Grethel; Gary Douglas, Chris Shannon and Teresa Evans all of
						Craynor. We have two daughters-in-law, Verdie Mae Evans and Patricia Evans of Craynor, and one
						son-in-law, Burchell Newsome of Grethel. Kendall loved these three as if they were his own. We
						also have six grandchildren whom we love with all our hearts, one of whom preceded him in death,
						Burchell Newsome Jr. Remaining are Petrina and Avery Jody Newsome, Kent Dougless, Heather Dawn,
						and Christopher Brandon Evans. He has one sister, Hattie Howell of Craynor, and four brothers,
						Hatter Evans of Grethel, Jay B and Edgar Evans, both of Dayton, Ohio and Tivis Evans of Craynor,
						who followed him in death four months later. He was a retired construction worker, coal miner
						and the neighborhood carpenter. It's so hard to go on without him, I wish we could have had more
						time together, time just went by too fast. We just had one short month together after he took
						sick, the doctors and nurses didn't think he would make it three or four times. But the good
						Lord let us keep him a little longer. Kendall was in the hospital about three weeks the last
						time, and the last week he kept asking us to bring him home, he wanted to come home so bad he
						would say "Lets go home hon, you got the car we can just go." I asked the doctor if there was
						any way possible to bring him home, a few hours later the doctor let us bring him home. Kendall
						got to come home with us one week before God took him from us. The last spell he took he was
						praying and raised his arms in the air, we thought he was reaching for us, and we took hold of
						his arms, but I'm sure he was reaching for Jesus. Kendall was a very kind and loving man to all
						his family, friends and neighbors. He never saw a stranger and was willing to help anybody who
						needed it. We sure do miss him, it doesn't seem possible that he's gone, it seems like he's
						still here taking care of us. We sure do love and miss him, and I hope that the Lord finds a few
						odd jobs to keep him busy until we see him again. Written by his loving wife and family</p>

						Jay B. and Edgar Evans of Dayton, Ohio; and one brother, Kendal Evans, our dad, who died four
						months earlier on December 3, 1995. Tivis never met a stranger, he always had a kind word to say
						to everyone. When you were around him he kept you laughing by making jokes, even when he was
						sick in the hospital he would come up with something to make you smile. Tivis had to have one of
						his feet taken off and he would still joke about himself to make everyone else feel better. He
						said one day that the nurse asked him how tall he was and he had replied, I'm 5' 5" on one side
						and a "foot" shorter on the other. Tivis loved music of all kinds, he would sit and listen to
						the radio or tapes. As often as he could, he would make tapes for all of us, from some of his
						favorite music. Shortly before Tivis died he was in the Prestonsburg Hospital; he said he had
						seen our dad lying on a bed in front of him, just watching him. Mom told Tivis that dad was
						still looking after him, as all his family had done before. Tivis loved all his family so much.
						Shortly before he passed away he spoke of his children and how he wanted them to be taken care
						of and to tell his family that he loved every one of us. Tivis will be sadly missed by all his
						family and friends. But we know he is in a better place now. He is in Heaven, he and Daddy are
						with Grandma and Grandpa, and they are all watching over us now. We think Tivis would want us
						all to remember him with laughter and not tears, because that's how he lived his life, with
						smiles and laughter. We sure will miss you Uncle Tivis!! Written by his loving nieces, Marcella

					<p>Mom was born January 4, 1909 on the Rock House Fork of Big Creek in Pike County, Kentucky, the
						only child of Ida Bevins Caines and Kenis H. Caines. She was a 1929 graduate of Eastern Kentucky
						State Normal College. She taught school in Pike County from 1930 to 1933. A fellow teacher
						introduced her to her son, Thomas M. Gilbert, to whom she was married on December 20, 1931. Dad
						passed away October 14, 1987. Three children were born to Mexie and Tom: Thomas I. of Lorain,
						Ohio; John C. of Vermilion, Ohio; and Marlene Hoyarth of Indian Harbor Beach, Florida. Mom was a
						homemaker and substitute teacher until 1960, when she became a fulltime sewing instructor for
						the Singer Sewing Machine Co. in Lorain, where we had moved to in 1940. Mom and Dad both retired
						in 1976 and moved to Melbourne, Florida where they spent their "golden years." Mom enjoyed golf,
						bowling, cooking and sewing, but her greatest pleasure was in fellowshipping with the
						congregation of Myrtle Church into which she had been admitted upon giving her life over to God
						and being baptized on August 29, 1982. Mom returned to Ohio in 1992 and attended Little Edna
						Church, which was in correspondence with Myrtle Church, as often as she could. Mom departed this
						earth on October 12, 1995, and joined Dad at Heaven's door, from whence we all hope for glory.
						Survivors, in addition to her three children, include seven grandchildren and ten
						great-grandchildren. We are comforted by the gospel of Matthew which says "Blessed are they that
						mourn," for we know that Mom freely accepted the gift of salvation and the promise of eternal
						life. The following bit of verse, by an anonymous author, approaches what we all feel in our
						hearts. When God looked down upon the earth And chose to put new blessings there He gave the sky
						the sunset's glow Gave laughter gay to children's play; And then to every yearning soul That
						gift of tender worth, a mother. The lilv's sweetness is forgot And sunset's splendors fade to
						grey But fresh and dear through changing years, Through quiet nights or eager days, The love of
						her we love the best lives closley shrined within each breast - a mother. "Her children arise
						and call her blessed." Proverbs 31:28 Written by her son and friend, Tom Gilbert</p>

						County and departed this life April 10, 1996. As a young man he married Bethel Mae Johnson,
						September 4, 1953. Out of this union of love were five sons: Danny Hall, Frank Hall, Teddy Hall,
						Dwayne Hall, and Timothy Hall; one daughter, Fanny Hall, and ten grandchildren. Dad had six
						brothers and five sisters. Preceding him in death were four brothers and two sisters. Surviving
						him are two brothers, James Hall and Richard Hall. Dad was a man that everybody liked. He worked
						in the coal mines to provide for his family. Dad could always tell if something was wrong with
						one of the children. He would stay awake at night worrying over them. I believe Dad's suffering
						is over. He would always say, "Weep not for me, but weep for yourself." The last few years of
						his life Dad and Mom began going to church regularly. Dad loved to attend Providence Church at
						Dry Creek, Ohio. How he loved to hear the preaching and singing there. Many lonely nights at
						home he would be calling upon the name of the Lord, praying for us children. The Bible says that
						"Whosoever call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." I hope the children will live a
						better life, and love Mom while we have her with us, and not worry her. Let us all begin to
						change our ways and prepare to meet Daddy in that beautiful home. So often Dad would go talk to
						Monroe Jones and other preachers, asking them to pray for him. His conversations differ as well
						as his ways. Anyone who knew Dad could see the change in his life. Mom, Dad loved you! You and
						he were so happy together. Today his voice is still, a vacant place around home. I know you are
						lonely, but try to be glad, rejoice, and rest in comfort knowing that Dad is much better off at
						home with Jesus! Written by his son, Danny Hall</p>

						and Uncle Bill. Aunt Mae was born June 3, 1910, to Sylvan and Rebecca Damron Tackett, and
						deceased this life on May 23, 1996, being 85 years, 11 months and 20 days old. Uncle Bill was
						born August 8, 1906, and deceased this life Oct. 7, 1994, being 88 years 2 months and 1 day old.
						Aunt Mae and Uncle Bill were wed on Jan. 21, 1926, and unto this union there were no children.
						There was a niece and great nephew who felt as their own, Nada M. Collins, and John Roy "Boss
						Man" of Topmost, Kentucky. Aunt Mae became a member to the Providence Old Regular Baptist Church
						and lived a faithful and dedicated member for 59 years. Uncle Bill never became a member to any
						church, but let many friends and neighbors know that everything was all right between him and
						God. As they had many hardships in life, it seemed as though they accepted each with little or
						no complaints. As their health began to fail, in July 1993, they were admitted to the Martin
						County Health Care Facility at Inez, Kentucky, where they remained until death. In life they
						both cherished the very little things, anyone visiting, church, and Aunt Mae enjoyed her sewing,
						crocheting, gardening and flowers. Each held a very special place in their hearts. Aunt Mae
						leaves 2 sisters, Viola Lewis and Daisy Mullins, both of Virgie, Kentucky, and 1 brother, Jesse
						Bates, and a host of nieces and nephews. Uncle Bill leaves 3 brothers: Morgan Hall,
						Salyersville, Ky.; C.M. Isaacs, Prestonsburg, Ky.; and Audrey Collins, Mt. Sterling, Ky. He also
						leaves 5 sisters: Elsie Hall, Topmost, Ky.; Lou Eva Isaacs, Morristown, Tn.; Elma Pence, Zenia,
						Ohio; Edith Preston, Owingsville, Ky., and Othadale Downing, Cincinnati, Ohio; and a great host
						of nieces and nephews. The life that Aunt Mae and Uncle Bill lived lets me believe that they're
						together now, happy, and all their troubles and trials are over and they're resting in peace.

					<p><strong>TOMMY HALL [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with sadness, broken hearts, and great
						pride in his accomplishments that we have attempted to write this tribute to our grandfather,
						Tommy Hall. Our home will never be the same anymore since our Papa has gone to be with Jesus. No
						words can express how we feel about our Papa. He was so full of life, happiness, and love for
						his family. Tommy Hall was born on Dec. 7, 1916 at Melvin, Kentucky. He was the son of the late
						George and Pricie Cole Hall. He had three brothers and four sisters. He is survived by two
						brothers, Earnest and Vondall, and one sister, Daisy. One thing Papa instilled in all of us was
						a good work ethic. He was passionate and dependable with anything he set out to do. For a large
						portion of his life, he worked in the coal mines. He worked for both Inland Steel and Island
						Creek Coal Companies. Papa took most pride in being a long-standing member of the United Mine
						Workers Association, Local Union 5899. Papa was very involved in his community. He was
						responsible for starting the little league baseball program in Wheelwright. Papa's strong love
						for baseball and children continued all of his life. Including becoming a member of Joppa
						Church, one of the most important decisions Papa ever made was December 21, 1939 when he married
						our grandmother, Maggie Hall. Papa vowed to always provide for her and his family. He certainly
						kept his promise. Together they raised three children, Suette, Patti, and Terry. They will
						always be grateful to their Daddy for providing a good, loving home, life, and education. Papa's
						belief of a good education continues through two generations, and speaking for all of us we
						intend to carry on the tradition. Tommy was crazy about his family. He has seven grandchildren
						and six great-grandchildren. We each have been influenced by his personality and the life he
						lived. He taught Todd and me how to play the banjo and guitar; Chad and Aaron, baseball; and all
						of us his great sense of humor. I know a lot of family and friends are probably thinking right
						now of their own stories about our Papa. He never met a stranger and had a story or joke for
						everyone. Papa was kind and gentle to all of his family and in March of 1993 he joined the Joppa
						Old Regular Baptist Church. He and Mama attended every Sunday as long as health permitted. Papa
						loved his church and his Brothers and Sisters. Papa wanted the best for his church and has
						worked diligently to obtain land from the Railroad for Joppa Church. Our family intends to
						pursue this in his honor. Today we say goodbye to a great husband, father, and grandfather.
						Papa, we miss you and think of you daily. As you look down on us from Heaven, we want you to
						know we will take care of Mammaw. We love you and we know you are in a better place. Written by
						granddaughters Robin Rose and Ritra Willcoxon</p>

					<p><strong>BURLEY HAMILTON [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>(1936-1995) With a sad and broken heart and the help of the Lord we will try to write an obituary
						of a loving husband, father, and grandfather, Burley Hamilton. Burley was born December 28, 1936
						to the late Hasquie and Gustie Hamilton of Clintwood Virginia. He was the youngest of 12
						children, 6 of whom preceded him in death. He died October 9, 1995 at the Joppa Old Regular
						Baptist Church at Melvin Ky, in the lunchroom, making his stay here on earth 58 years 10 months
						and 12 days. Burley met and fell in love with Sadie (T.R.) Johnson Hamilton. They were united in
						the eyes of God on January 17, 1958, and into this union they were blessed with 5 children, 3
						boys and 2 girls: Avery (Jackie) Hamilton; Mary Sue Jones of Melvin, Ky.; Terry B Hamilton of
						McDowell, Ky.; Gary Hamilton of Melvin, Ky.; Shelia Anna Tackett of Hi Hat, Ky. Burley worked as
						a truck driver and a coal miner. He worked until the doctors took him out of the mines because
						he was disabled. He worked hard each day and every day to provide for his family, whom he loved
						so much. He had an even greater love for God. He joined Joppa Old Regular Baptist Church May 9,
						1992 and was baptized by Elder Hershell Slone and Elder Arnold Tackett. That Sunday morning he
						was so excited to tell everyone what good things the Lord had done for him that he didn't wait
						for the church door to open to give his hand he went during services. He filled his seat
						faithfully until moments before his death. When he went to his sister churches he would always
						stand up and invite everyone to come visit Joppa Church. His favorite song was "I'm Going To Die
						On The Battlefield" and he sung it only a few weeks before his death at his nephew's funeral.
						One of his brothers and sisters in church called him "Wild Man," while others called him
						"Smiley" or "Happy" because he was always smiling. He greeted everyone with a smile and a warm
						hand shake. He never met a stranger because he always had a kind word to say to everyone he met.
						He showed his kindness and love to everyone in and out of church. He would go visit sick people
						in the hospital and their homes. If anyone needed him, he would help in any way he could. Left
						to mourn his death are his wife; children; 8 grandchildren; 1 sister, Maxie Stanley; 4 brothers:
						Carson, Lincoln, Kermit, and his twin brother Worley Hamilton, all of Clintonwood, Va.; and a
						host of nieces, nephews, friends, brothers, and sisters in church. We all loved him more than
						words can say and our hearts ache each and every day for him. He will live forever in our
						hearts. We will allow the memories to live through his children and grandchildren. His death has
						left an empty place in all our hearts that can never be filled. But our loss is Heaven's gain,
						for there is one more bright star in God's Heaven. He can't come back to us, but by the Grace of
						God we can go to him. Sleep on, sleep on. until we meet again for your work here on earth is
						done. Written by a broken-hearted family</p>

					<p>It is with much sadness and empty hearts that we will try to write this obituary for our
						departed, but never forgotten, father and grandfather. Ervin Hamilton was born August 12, 1914
						in Teaberry, the son of the late Wilburn Lee and Martha Jane Tackett Hamilton. Ervin passed away
						October 24, 1985, after a long illness. Ervin was 71 years of age. Ervin was preceded in death
						by one daughter, Wanda Hamilton, two sisters, two brothers, one grandchild and one
						great-grandchild. Ervin leaves to walk the path with God to take his place in Heaven. He leaves
						to mourn his departure his beloved wife, Lillie Mae Tackett Hamilton; four sons: Ray Hamilton
						Jr. and Will Hamilton of Beaver; Ervin Hamilton Jr. of Lexington; Paul Eugene Hamilton of
						Danville; four daughters: Elizabeth Henson, Geneva Hall, Eva Vance and Verdie Mae Hamilton all
						of Beaver; six brothers: Frank and Sterling Hamilton both of Teaberry; Hershel and Willie
						Hamilton, both of Beaver; Russell Hamilton of Price and Wilburn Hamilton Jr. of Willard, Ohio;
						three sisters: Hazel Bentley and Mary Newsome, both of Beaver; Goldia Newsome of Price; 30
						grandchildren and 43 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren; many nieces, nephews,
						and friends. Ervin was a retired coal miner; he was a member of the U.M.W.A Local No. 8100 at
						Ligon. The last few words that I heard my grandfather say were, "God's sending his angels to
						take me home to be with my mother, girls pray with me." He took his daughters' hands, they began
						to pray, tears gently fell, they could see this peaceful look within him. God took away the
						foundation of the light and the man, but the light still shines and the memories still linger.
						The light shines bright in all our minds, our hearts and our dreams. The light that time will
						never dim, the man that we all will never forget. Father was one of the true gentleman of our
						times. He seemed to enjoy everyone that he met and left a great impression upon them. He liked
						visiting the courthouse to see his old buddies, and meeting new friends, for he never met a
						stranger. He especially loved the visits from the family and friends, for you had to sit down
						and watch his favorite sports, basketball and baseball games, or the news. You could look at
						him, and in his eyes you could see the warmth and love that was within him. His memory will
						always live on in our hearts and when the time comes for God to take us home, will take the
						path, and we shall unite again in Heaven's paradise. Written by his beloved Family</p>

					<p><strong>LILLIE MAE TACKETT HAMILTON [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>It is with much sadness and lonely hearts that we will try to write this obituary for our
						cherished mother and grandmother. Lillie Mae Tackett Hamilton was born June 1, 1917 at Teaberry,
						Kentucky, the daughter of the late George and Becky Bentley Tackett of Beaver, Ky. She passed
						away February 14, 1996. She lived a fulfilled 78 years. Lillie Mae married the late Ervin
						Hamilton on June 29,1933. Preceding her in death are 1 daughter, Wanda Hamilton, 3 sisters, 4
						brothers, 1 grandchild and 2 great-grandchildren. Lillie Mae left with her heart full of
						happiness for she has taken her place in Heaven, to walk with God in perfect peace. She leaves
						behind her to mourn 8 children: Elizabeth Henson of Ivel, Ky.; Geneva June Hall, Eva June Vance,
						Verdie Mae Hamilton, Ray Hamilton Jr., Will Hamilton all residents of Beaver, Ky.; Ervin
						Hamilton Jr. of Lexington, Ky.; and Paul Eugene Hamilton of Danville, Ky. Also left are thirty
						grandchildren, forty-three great-grandchildren, two great-great-grandchildren, and many nieces,
						nephews and friends. In our hearts we feel God took our mother on February 14, Valentines Day,
						to be with her beloved husband, Ervin, to reunite their everlasting love for eternity. One thing
						people always remembered about mother was her kind, warming smile. The family will never forget
						how that smile never ceased to warm their hearts. Forget your grief and tears, for that shining
						smile she had on earth is brighter, for she is in a perfect place. Mamaw loved to attend the
						Samaria Regular Baptist Church, when she was able. She loved working in her garden and raising
						her radiant flowers. To show her affection on those long winter days she made sublime quilts for
						her children. They will always possess these quilts she made with such maternal love. Each time
						we visited Mamaw, she would want us to either be sitting, talking and laughing, or sometimes, if
						they needed it, water her plants. She would always make sure that everyone had eaten. Mamaw was
						always sitting on the porch waiting for company, she loved having friends and family stop by and
						visit. We are happy to say that in the years she was with us she was always there for us, she
						didn't ask questions or judge us, she sat and listened with an understanding heart. We believe
						she tried to lead us down the right path, for she had the wisdom, strength, and the love in her
						heart to help us in our times of need. We would ask her "What would we ever do without you?" she
						would always reply with "Don't worry, I would never leave my family." Now we all realize what
						she meant, for she is still in our hearts. One very special gift she gave us was how to be a
						better person and parent, and to always show the love you have for your family. Our one wish is
						to be as strong, good, and loving as she was. You always saw these qualities in her. We feel
						that Mamaw is resting in peace with the Lord and loved ones. We believe our loss is Heaven's
						gain. Written by her ever-loving family</p>

						and die in a hospital, but each time he always pulled through. When Dad left this world, he died
						peacefully at home. Dad didn't belong to any church, but many Christian people have told us of
						the good dreams they have had of him since his death. Daddy had a kind word and friendly laugh,

						August 18, 1910 and departed this life on March 18, 1996 at the age of 85. She was the daughter
						of Isaac Parsons and Mary Darcus (Hamilton) Parsons. She was one of 14 children; 12 preceded her
						in death. One sister survives her, Melvinia P Gillis of Frankfort, Ky. Her late sisters were:
						Armenia Taylor, Elizabeth Catherine Crum, Allie McMann, and Della Hall. Her late brothers were:
						Jim Bob, John, Bill, Elemer, Zion, Jackson, and twins Richard and Wilburn, who died in infancy.
						Octavia married Anthony Hamilton, who survives her, on May 28, 1927. Anthony is the son of
						Freeman Davenport "Bud" Hamilton and Virginia (Hall) Hamilton. From the union between Anthony
						and Octaiva were born seven children. The first son died in infancy. Edfert Hamilton of
						Lexington, Ky deceased October 17, 1990. Eddie Hamilton of Harold, Ky.; Palmer Hamilton of
						Harold, KY; Gillis Hamilton of Elkton, Md.; and Clara Martin of Elkton, Md. are left to mourn
						their dear mother's passing. She also leaves 17 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren, three
						step-great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild. Tava was baptized August 20, 1978. Her
						membership was at Pilgrim's Home Old Regular Baptist Church. Often they walked over three miles
						to church, when they didn't have a ride. She fell and broke her hip around 1987 and never fully
						recovered. She was bedridden and afflicted with much pain and suffering the last years of her
						life. She was cared for by a devoted husband, Anthony, and her son, Palmer, as well as her
						daughter-in-law, Joyce. Great will be their reward in Heaven for their love and care that they
						gave to Mom. They met her every need. Her daughter-in-law, Betty, who was like a daughter to
						her, often said Tava was the only mother she ever knew, and she treated her like her own mother.
						This is only a temporary "goodbye," until we are reunited in Heaven when God calls all His
						children home. Mom is no longer in pain, but resting in the arms of Jesus Christ. She can not
						come back to us, but we can go to her, someday! Written by Dorthy Hamilton (daughter-in-law)</p>

						will never know how much I miss him. Dwayne's father, Travis Darrell Hamilton, was killed in a

						too. Dwayne left behind his stepfather, Ricky Hamilton, who had been with him for twenty-one
						years. He also left behind three brothers: Steven Darrell, Ricky Darren and Christopher Scott;

					<p>Martha (Tackett) Hampton was born October 29th, 1916 and passed away on September 14th, 1996,
						making her stay on this earth 79 years, 8 months and 15 days. She was the seventh child of eight
						children who were born unto the late Oliver and Emoline (Hudson) Tackett. Martha was preceded in
						death by both parents, three brothers: Duran, Edgbert & John Tackett, and three sisters: Vadnie
						Caudill, Viola Little and Elsie Little. She leaves one sister, Anel Hampton, and a host of
						nieces and nephews to mourn her passing. Martha married her beloved husband, Basil Hampton, on
						December 9, 1932. To this union were born two children, Gladzie Fern and Vernon Webster, both of
						whom died in infancy. Basil, her faithful husband of 64 years, stood by her bedside during the
						last five years of her life and was at that post on Saturday morning when the angel from Heaven
						came and took her home to receive her great reward. Martha joined the Old Regular Baptist Church
						the fourth Saturday in April, 1935 at the young age of 17. She was baptized that same day by
						Elder Drake Bowling and remained a faithful member for over 61 years. She was an inspiration to
						all who knew her! She never failed to tell you about Jesus and to talk about her church. Her
						greatest joy in life came from getting dinner ready for the Enterprise Church each church time
						and telling "Bas," which is what she called him, just how to place the food in the trunk of the
						car to protect it. She really loved her church! Martha did so much to help the people of this
						community that it will never be the same without her. She would love to shout, sing and praise
						her Lord at church so much that it will never be the same without her. She lived a full and
						happy life on earth and I'm sure she is now receiving the reward she was always looking for. She
						will certainly be in that number when the saints go marching in! </p>

					<p>It is with great sadness that I, with the help of our dear Lord, write this obituary of my loving
						mother and sister in the Lord. Mommy was born April 8, 1924 to the late Monroe and Mellie France
						Smallwood. She departed this life May 10, 1996, exchanging a world of sickness and pain for a
						peaceful home. Mommy married my daddy, Robert Lee Hampton, on November 24, 1948. To this union I
						was the only child born. Mommy is also survived by her daughter-in-law, Deloris Potter Hampton,
						whom she loved and thought of as her own daughter; three brothers: Roy Smallwood of Dorton,
						Kentucky, George (Ben) Smallwood of Birmingham, Michigan, Aubrey Smallwood of West Minster,
						South Carolina; and two sisters, Fern Webb of Catlettsburg, Kentucky, and Audrey Mullins of
						Dorton, Kentucky. Her loving husband, Robert Lee Hampton, and three brothers, Monroe Smallwood,
						Jr., Marvin Smallwood, and Creed Smallwood, preceded her in death. Mommy had been a member of
						the Regular Baptist Church for many years with her membership being at Enterprise since November
						15, 1958. I have suffered a great loss, but I feel my loss is Heaven's gain. I tried to comfort
						my mother on the night that my daddy died by saying "Mommy, we can go to Heaven to be with Daddy
						some day:" Now, those thoughts keep me going. I pray each day that when my life here on earth is
						over I can go to Heaven to be with Mommy and Daddy again. Written in loving memory by her son,

					<p><strong>EDGAR HICKS [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>With loving memories I will write this obituary of one that was so dear to us, Edgar Hicks. He
						was born to the late Bill and Jemima Frasure Hicks on August 5, 1916 at Pyramid, Kentucky in
						Floyd County, and departed this life on November 28, 1995 of a sudden illness. Edgar was united
						in marriage to Pearlie Marie Hale Hicks on December 15, 1942. Unto this union were born 10
						children, including two sets twins. Surviving besides his dear companion, Pearlie, are three
						daughters: Ruby Oliver, Flatwoods, Ky. Mima Parsons and Betty Vanhorn both of Ashland, Ky.; and
						seven sons: Edgar W. (Eddie) of Ocala, FL.; Michael (Mike) Charles, Paul and Henderson all of
						Ashland, KY; Melvin and Mark of Lexington, Ky; fifteen grandchildren and two
						great-grandchildren. Also left to mourn their loss are three brothers: Floyd of Willard, Ohio;
						Willie, Prestonsburg, KY; Burnis of Wilmington, Ohio; and three sisters: Delphia Fryer and Edna
						Prater, both of Ashland, Ky.; and Margie White, Fayetteville, N.C. Preceding him in death were
						three brothers: Ezra, Ernest and Elzie; and two sisters, Ellen Shepherd and Anna Prater. Edgar
						was baptized by Elders Baxter Osborne and Elias Cotton on December 7, 1946 and placed his
						membership with the Little Jewell Church in Ashland, Ky. On December 10, 1978 he went by letter
						to the Little Mary Church in Ashland and was ordained a deacon there on July 14, 1979, where he
						remained in fellowship until death. For outstanding service to his country during World War II
						Edgar was awarded several medals, including the Purple Heart. He was employed for several years
						by A.C. Lawrence Leather Co. and Ramey Ford in Ashland, Kentucky. Edgar suffered a stroke about
						six years ago, which left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak except a few words. Even
						though he was confined to a wheel chair, he was never demanding but kind and patient. We believe
						the life he lived was a light to all who knew him. He loved company, and was always so pleased
						when the brothers and sisters from church came to visit. Although we miss him so much, we feel
						that he has gone to that eternal home where there is joy and peace forever. Edgar was laid to
						rest in the Happy Ridge Cemetery in Ashland, Ky. Written by his sister, Delphia Fryer The 28 of
						November is a day I will always remember. To me it was a sad day, because I got news from home
						that my Dad had passed away. Even though it hurts to know he's gone from us at last, we know
						he's not suffering now, like he did in years that's passed. He's singing now and shouting, I
						know he's being blessed, For now he's Home with Jesus, to claim his peaceful rest. Written by
						his son, Edgar W. (Eddie) Hicks</p>

					<p><strong>NEWBERRY HOWELL [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>In loving memory of our beloved daddy, I will try with much sadness to write the obituary of
						Newberry Howell. He was the son of the late Green and Nannie Hamilton Howell. He was born on
						April 26, 1930 and passed away on Thursday night October 5, 1996 at 8:15 at his home. He went
						from this world into God's loving care. Daddy had punished so much the last two years and prayed
						so hard not to smother, but to go in his sleep. He went easy, I don't think he even knew. His
						surviving brother and sisters are: Will Palmer Howell, Rosanna Hamilton, Jean Deskins and Alice
						Miller. He married our mother, Pearl Carroll, on July 17, 1952. There were three children born,
						one set of twins, Shirley Compton on Virley Parsons Gunter, and one son, Cecil Howell. Daddy was
						a welder and meter reader for Ashland Oil Exploration and retired after working for 40 years. He
						was dearly loved by the men and women at Ashland Oil. Those who came to his funeral know what a
						beautiful service it was. He had an Ashland motorcade from the funeral home to church and onto
						the gravesite. The men from Ashland Oil helped to make the cemetery for him and they were his
						honorary pallbearers. It was so beautiful that day, like God was smiling down on us. He would
						have been so proud. He would thank each and everyone for coming. Daddy joined the Old Regular
						Baptist Church after he had prayed and prayed about it. He would tell me he felt he wasn't good
						enough, or wasn't doing good enough for the Lord. We talked about it often and he would tell me
						his dreams. At last he had a dream about "Papaw" (Green Howell). He was motioning for him to
						come with him. Daddy said he couldn't leave his family, brothers, and sisters. Papaw told him it
						was all right, that they would come later. So after that dream, he could join with a good heart.
						One Saturday I was over cleaning house and Daddy ask me, "What are we going to do with all them
						babies?" I told him he had three babies. He said, "Not them, all these in white dresses." Once
						he asked Virley and Mom to watch those babies on the bed. He had told Aunt Alice and Aunt
						Rosanna about people singing old-time songs. I know in my heart Daddy is in a better place. I
						know Daddy was grateful for those who helped to give his shots and pills, and work that machine
						from Texas. He would thank Virley, Patsy , Mom, and especially Aunt Alice for being there every
						night. He once told Aunt Rosanna, "Now you can have Alice when I'm gone, but let me keep her
						now." Thank you all, from the bottom of his heart Daddy has seven grandchildren: Nathan Eric,
						Billy Brian and John Russell Parsons, Brooke Anne and Jessica Lane Compton, Starsky Michael and
						Chase Tyler Howell. Daddy told Cecil he didn't care to die, he just hated to leave the children.
						We all miss you so much. I love you, Daddy. With much sadness and all my love, Shirley (Mamaw's
						cow)</p>

						hours and listen to him. We miss his stories as much as we miss him. He was a person that you
						would fall in love with from the first time you met him. He was everyone's grandpa. John C. Huff

					<p><strong>MARY JANE HUNTER [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>Today seems like such an empty day, my heart is broken, my tears are flowing, but Jesus said He
						would bottle them up. By the grace of God I pray Mom is resting until the great morning and all
						who love and keep God's commandments can rise again when the trumpet sounds. We can all go
						rejoicing home together. My mother was Mary Jane Hunter. She was born to John and Jane Marshall
						on Stephen's Branch, Ky. August 20, 1901. Mom married Craig Hunter in 1919. They lived a
						Christian life and raised nine children. Three infants died just after birth. Dad died in 1969,
						leaving Mom and nine of us children to mourn our loss. In 1984, Marvin and Myrtie died and
						Verlie died in 1986. Gervie passed away in 1995. Now there are five of us left to mourn the loss
						of our mother. Mom belonged to Little Dove Church. She was a faithful member as long as she
						could go. She joined the Little Dove Church October, 1934. She always enjoyed the church and
						good people. Her doors were always open when she kept house. The coffee pot and cake were always
						ready. No matter who came, she wanted them to eat before they left. Mom spent the last seven or
						eight years with me. I fed her every bite she ate for the last seven months of her life. Mom was
						very special to her children and 46 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. There was a great
						host of us all. We did everything we could for Mom to make her life comfortable. Mom told us the
						week before she died that she was going to die. She started an old song, "Oh Sing to Me of
						Heaven When I am Called to Die." She sang one verse real plain. Brother Freddy got the song book
						and finished singing it for her. She loved to hear him sing. He was so good to Mom. He would
						lift her from her wheelchair to the recliner and to bed. Mom, sleep on and rest. By the Grace of
						God we will see you again. I hope the family will read the old King James version Bible and
						prepare to get ready, because Jesus is coming again, ready or not. He said it would have been
						better if you would have never been born when your time is up. It's too late then. Love you all.
						Don't forget the Old Regular Baptist Church. It's been a good home for me and Mom. Love and
						prayers to all, Sister Sue Kidd and Brother Freddy Kidd</p>

					<p><strong>DOROTHY JOHNSON [Photo Not Available]</strong></p>
					<p>It is with a sad and broken heart that we will try to write an obituary of Dorothy Johnson.
						Dorothy was the daughter of the late Has Johnson and Lillie Mae Hall Johnson. Dorothy was born
						on November 20, 1957 and departed from this life June 20, 1996, making her stay here on earth 38

						God's great throne. So we like to say to Dorothy's loved ones that she had left back here, If

						Kidd. She also has nineteen grandchildren and seventeen great-grandchildren who loved her
						dearly. She was a member of the Little Salem Old Regular Baptist Church since 1952. There aren't
						enough words that could express how much we are going to miss our mother. She was the most
						gentle and kind person anyone could know. We never knew what it was for her not to be caring and
						loving. She didn't know how to be mean, she just knew how to love her family. Our mother was a
						kind hearted and forgiving person. Her heart was full of love for this family who is grieving
						for her today. She was generous to a fault and loved her children, grandchildren and

						that she is watching over all of us right now. She would want us all to continue loving one
						another as only a close family can. We will have to stop and just remember the love she had for

					<p>Bonnie G. Hall Kohler was born December 17, 1935, the daughter of Everett and the late Carrie 0.
						Hall of Bevinsville, Ky. She departed this life May 5, 1996 in an automobile accident in the
						state of Michigan, making her stay here on this earth 60 years, 4 months and 18 days. She is
						survived by her husband, Donald Kohler; one daughter, Deborah Thomas; two sons, Michael and Mark
						Castle; and six grandchildren. Also surviving are six sisters: Eileen Johnson, Lorraine Little,
						Jeanette Ramey, JoAnn West, Barbara Joyce Harris, Emily Ellen Youngert; and one brother, James
						Wesley Hall, and numerous nieces and nephews. Our hearts are so heavy with deep sorrow upon the
						loss of our dear loved one. She was such a kind, loving, and giving person who was always there
						in times of need. She gave herself so unselfishly. She was not a member of the church, but one
						thing she had in her favor was that she believed the truth about repentance and faith toward
						God, which is the basic principal of the doctrine of Jesus Christ our Lord. Don, her husband,
						said that after the accident she was praying to the Lord with much fervor, and we believe that
						because of the dreams and visions that the Lord has given us as a witness her soul is in the
						Paradise of God to await the resurrection of the body on that great and notable day. Sincerely
						written by Lorraine Little</p>
