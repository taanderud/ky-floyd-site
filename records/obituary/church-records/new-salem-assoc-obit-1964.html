                    <p><strong>ELDER EARL HOWARD [Photo Not Available]</strong> Elder Earl Howard was the son of the
                        late Brison and Nancy Howard. He was born Feb�ruary 22, 1890, and departed this life February
                        23, 1964, making his stay on earth seventy - four years and one day. In early life, he was wed
                        to Emma Reed who departed this life July 17, 1958. Then in the second choice, he was wed to
                        Essie Gayheart in whom he had a very happy marriage in the last days of his stay on earth. He
                        had been sick with hardened arteries for the last three years, but he bore his sickness without
                        complaint and continued to visit churches and serve God. He joined the Old Regular Baptist
                        Church about forty- nine years ago. Through the church, he is known to the community as a
                        wonderful minister and friend. Brother Earl Howard was a man that devoted his life to serving
                        the Lord by building church houses, attending funerals, and serving as the moderator of
                        churches. He was the moderator of Bails Branch Church when he died. He has served this church
                        faithfully for many years. He had helped with the building of eight church houses, and we shall
                        certainly miss him in the circle. He was the father of ten children, five boys and five girls.
                        Mother and two of the boys, Elder Raymond Howard, and Isadore Howard, preceded him in death.
                        That leaves eight children to mourn his loss: Norman Howard, Dema, Ken�tucky; Burton Howard,
                        Mousie, Kentucky; James Dullard Howard, Martin, Kentucky; Mrs. Eldred Allen, Fairborn, Ohio;
                        Mrs. Imogene Morris, Clarksville, Indiana; Mrs. Allene Sammons, Franklin, Ohio; Mrs. Goldie
                        Stewart, Cleveland, Ohio; and Mrs. Donnie Sue Brown, Dayton, Ohio. He also leaves thirty-one
                        grandchildren, fifteen great grandchildren, one brother Melvin Howard, a large host of kindred
                        and friends. We have a lot to be thankful for. With the four that have passed away, they have
                        all left a wonderful hope. So to those that are left, let me say, we know not what hour the
                        death angel is coming around again and which one he will call for. So be ye always ready, for
                        you know not the hour the death angel will caM for you, and the main thing is to be prepared.
                        Let me say to the children, relatives and friends that are left, farewell, Elder Earl Howard has
                        just beat us to tl~e happy home. He has died in the Lord and is resting from his labors. To his
                        wife, let me say, if you want to live where your husband has gone, prepare to meet God in this
                        life.&nbsp; Written by his son, Elder Burton Howard A memorial will be preached the third in
                        October at Ball Branch Church.</p>
                    <p><strong>ISTIAMEL GIBSON</strong>&nbsp; [Photo Not Available] Brother Ishamel Gibson was born
                        August 15, 1913 and de�parted this life March 25, 1964. He was the son of Miles Sr. and Lucy
                        Bradley Gibson. He was married to Viola Huff, December 23, 1932 and to this union was born 3
                        children. One boy and two girls, Gerald Clark Gibson, Charlene Gibson, and Carol Faye Gibson. He
                        joined the Old Regular Baptist Church and was baptized by Elder Bert Howard and Elder Coy Combs
                        on the third Sunday in November of 1954 and took his fellowship in the Ball Branch Church and
                        re�mained there 7 years. He then moved his letter to the Steels Creek Church where he remained
                        until his death. He was the assistant clerk of the Church. He was faithful to fill his seat as
                        long as he was able to come and was a strong defender of the old time way and faith. He leaves
                        to mourn his earthly loss his mother and good wife and children and brothers and sisters who
                        stood by him until the end; also, a great host of brothers and sis�ters of the Old Regular
                        Baptist Church and many friends, but I feel down deep in my heart our earthly loss has been his
                        heavenly gain. He said during his illness, �If he should be permitted to live a thousand years
                        he would be no more ready to go than now.� He feared no man and he followed no man; God alone
                        knew his heart. He said he didn�t fear death, but desired not to linger and suffer so long. So
                        dear children if you want to go where I believe Broth�er Isharnels soul has gone and where
                        Sister Viola has hopes of going you will have to serve the same God they have while you live
                        here on this earth. Ministers he requested in his funeral were Brother Bert Howard, Brother
                        Ellis Hopkins, Brother Troy Nickels, and Brother Green Bradley.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>B. T. THOMAS</strong>&nbsp; [Photo Not Available] The obituary of B. T. Thomas, the son
                        of James and Sarah Thomas born October 28, 1963, being 86 years and two days old. He was wed to
                        Manda Collins in 1906. In early life to this union was born 10 children. Two preceded him in
                        death, leaving eight still living. Brother T, as we always called him, joined the Old Regular
                        Church about 42 years ago in which he lived a fruitful life, one in which his children and his
                        neighbors would do well to take heed of his life. He. was a Deacon of the Old Ball Fork Church.
                        The church has lost a good pillar, a member and the community has lost a good neighbor. He
                        leaves to mourn his passing his wife, Manda, and eight children, sixty grand children and
                        thirty-nine great grand children. Brother T was loved by practically all men who knew him. We
                        will not say all because the Bible says �Woe be unto the man everybody speaks well of,� but as a
                        neighbor, he couldn�t be beat for he had the respect of everybody. We certainly feel that our
                        loss is Heaven�s gain. When he was dying Sister Manda said he patted her hand and smiled and
                        fell asleep. So to his children especially to those who have not made peace with God, if you
                        ever want to see Daddy again, make peace with God while life and opportunity affords. We have to
                        prepare in this life if we ever see how the Glory World looks.</p>

                    <p><strong>ELDER TONA HALL</strong> [Photo Not Available] It is of much sadness that we attempt to
                        write an obituary of our beloved husband and father, Tona Hall. He was born April 17, 1901 and
                        deceased this life May 24, 1964. He was the son of Walter and Elizabeth Vanderpool Hall,.
                        deceased. He leaves his companion Susanna Hall, and 2 living children, Mrs. Virginia Hagans of
                        Hi-Hat, Ky. and Mrs. Leoria Tucker of East Point, Ga. and leaves 1 grand child, Susanna Tucker
                        to mourn his loss. Three children preceded him in death, Essa Lona, Marvin Maynard, and unnamed
                        baby son. Also leaves the following brothers and sisters living, Jack Hall, Vest, Ky., Sam
                        Hughes, Clintwood, Va., Anna Hill, Clintwood, Va., Alice Conley, Huntington, W. Va., Mary
                        Compton, Chesapeake, Ohio. With brothers deceased Wayne Hughes, Lee Hughes and Joe Hall. Brother
                        Tona joined the Philadelphia Regular Baptist Church approximately 15 years ago and was loved by
                        all who knew him and he was whole heartily devoted to his family and all neighborhood children.
                        Always showed great love and admiration for everyone. He was badly afflicted for many years and
                        bore his sickness with patience. We have no doubt that according to his testimony and the life
                        he lived but that he has passed out of this life to a life of peace and happiness with his loved
                        ones gone on before. The family wishes to thank all his friends and neighbors for their help and
                        concern during his sickness and death.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>ELDER TROY CAUDILL</strong>&nbsp; [Photo Not Available]&nbsp; I will try and write a
                        short sketch of the life of my Dear Beloved Brother to wit, Troy Caudill. He was born Dec. 26,
                        1912, died Dec. 16, 1962. He was 51 years., 11 months, 14 days old. He was the son of Wilburn
                        and Lize Caudill. He was married to Mary Liz Gibson. Unto this union was born 8 children, 2
                        preceded him in death as infants. Names of children: Elder Fay Crawford, Bobby Gene Caudill,
                        Delmer Caudill, Anna Mae Burger, Allen Caudill, all live at Lexington, Ky. Linda Gay Caudill at
                        Melvin, Ky. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church July 1944, ordained first Saturday in
                        November 1953. He lived so humble a life and I say to his wife and children if they ever want to
                        see him again, they will have to be born again. So may God bless them and that they never will
                        forget the good preaching he always preach to them. So I feel I can say sleep on brother until I
                        come where you are. He loved to go to Church and meet his brothers and sisters. He loved to fill
                        his seat and I hope I can see some of his children or his wife fill it before I have to
                        die.&nbsp;</p>

                        write a few words about my dear sweet Mother who is gone but not forgotten. She was born May 11,
                        1866 and departed this life April 9, 1960. She was a member of the Caney Fork Church for forty
                        years. She loved her church and was a faithful member as long as she was able to go. She was so
                        humble and kind to everyone. I can remember when I was growing up, people would pass by and she
                        would go out to the road and ask them to come in and eat with her. She would say �I have it on
                        the table, come and eat with me.� She loved to see anybody come to visit her. Oh, how we miss
                        her no tongue can tell. She visited my home about a year before she went away. She said, �I want
                        to see where you live before I go away.� I am living in hopes that I will see her again when
                        this life is over.&nbsp;</p>

                        that I. try to write an obituary of my dear Mother. Alice (Johnson) Osborne was born July 19,
                        1899, deceased this life January 11, 1963. She was married to Willard Os�borne October 9, 1913.
                        Unto this union was born 8 children. Two boys and two girls and her husband preceded her in
                        death, leaving 2 girls, 2 boys, 19 grandchildren and 5 great great grandchildren to mourn her

                        lived a faithful life till death. Mom is gone but forgotten. I have been with her so many times
                        in my dreams since she has been gone but I have a hope that we will live together again after
                        this life is over. Well there are so many good things I could say about Mother but space doesn�t
                        permit it. All I can say to the family is if you ever want to meet Mother again you must fall
                        out from sin and be born again.</p>

                        try to write the obituary of my father and mother. Father has been gone for 26 years. I want
                        their obituary written together. John Owens was the son of Vencon and Lucinda Owens. He was born
                        June 18, 1878 and died June 9, 1985. He was 57 years, 11 months, and 21 days old. He was
                        afflicted with that dreadful disease T. B. He suffered severely for 18 months. He said he was
                        just waiting for God�s time. Just a short time before he died he said, �0 Lord, haven�t I
                        suffered long enough to go home?, take me on.� He seemed to suffer but little more. Helen was
                        the daughter of Tandy and Ann Slone. She was born August 29, 1878 and died November 23, 1961.
                        Mother was afflicted with hardened arteries. She was so humble and bore her sickness with
                        patience. She was sick for sometime. They were married in the year of 1892. Unto this union was
                        born fifteen children, 6 boys and 9 girls. They joined he Old Regular Baptist Church about the
                        year of 1911. They were faithful members as long as they were able to go. They served the church
                        as deacons for several years. They showed great interest in the church as long as they lived.
                        They prayed for their children and gave us good advice. The good council of our mother and
                        father is still living in our hearts today. The family is almost gone. Six children are left to
                        mourn their loss. They are: Alva Owens, Hindman, Kentucky; Kennel Owens, Lackey, Kentucky;

                        and mother, but we feel our loss is heavens gain. Thanks be to God I believe I will meet them
                        again in that beautiful home where we will part no more. They will not be sick there.</p>

                        making his stay on earth seventy-five. years, eight months, and five. days. In early life, he
                        was wed to Sister Emma Hays. To this union was born four children to wit: Ezra Turner and
                        Trimble Turner, both of Wayland, Kentucky; Hatler Turner, Dema, Kentucky; and Zeda Turner,
                        at&nbsp; home. Morg Turner has been a life long resident of Wayland. He was a good neighbor and
                        will be badly missed among his neighbors. He leaves his wife, Emma, his four children, two
                        grandchildren, J o h n Morgan T u r n e r, Tennessee, and Joe Turner, Tennessee; two great-
                        grandchildren, one brother, Buck Morris, and one niece, Bill Turner�s wife and a host of friends
                        and relatives to mourn his loss. Brother H a w 1 e y Warrens asked Morg just before he left for
                        the hospital that in case he did not come home, how the case was with him. Morg told Brother
                        Hawley that there was nothing in his way; he was alright and ready to meet God. We of the
                        Regular Baptist will certainly miss him in the old church, because he was more faithful than
                        some of the members in filling his seat. The good Lord was mighty good to his family. Morg was
                        the first one to go out of the family. However, let me say to the children; if you want to see
                        Daddy again, you will have to come to God and repent and be born again. To Sister Emma, the time
                        won�t permit us to wait too long before you see Brother Morg again. Jesus says in Revelations,.
                        �Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth says the spirit they may rest from
                        their labors and their works do follow them.� Let me say that the best word was for Morg to say
                        that there was nothing in his way.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>JOHNNIE HALL</strong> [Photo Not Available]&nbsp; Johnnie Hall was the son of Jonas Hall
                        and Rebecca Hall. He was born May 5, 1894 and departed this life July 19, 1964. He was seventy
                        years, two months and a few days old at the time the death angel made its visit to his home.
                        Johnnie, to his neighbors lived a good life. H~ had belonged to the Old Regular Baptist Church,
                        of which he was a deacon, about twenty-six years. lie was wed to Wanna Hall in the year of 1914
                        and to this union was born eight children, one preceding him in death. Two boys, Herald, Lackey,
                        Kentucky, and James, Dayton, Ohio; Mrs. Ada Martin, Dayton, Ohio; Zelda Tuttle, Topmost,
                        Kentucky; Elva Wadkins, Pippa Passes, Kentucky; Florince Mullins, Mousie, Kentucky; Noe Slone,
                        Lackey, Kentucky. Brother Johnnie became sick and went to the hospital for an operation and
                        received a shot in the spine which para�lyzed his whole body. lie bore illS sickness with
                        patience and Sister Wanna must have been blessed because she waited on him day and night
                        standing over him continually. There was a love between them that could o n I y be separated by
                        death. We believe according to his life among his children and his neighbors, that Brother
                        Johnnie has just left a world of trouble and now is resting from all his labors. He leaves to
                        mourn his passing, forty grandchildren, thir�teen great-grandchildren, his wife, three brothers,
                        James Hall, Cold Grove, Ohio; George Hall, Bevensville, Kentucky; and Willie Hall, Bevensville,
                        Kentucky; one sister, Anna Slone, Faulton, Ohio; a large host of kindred and friends. To the
                        children that have not made peace with God, Brother Johnnie has passed from this world to a
                        never ending eternity and I am sure he would like for his children to follow him, but if you
                        don�t repent, I do not believe you will ever see your daddy again. He left this world telling
                        his com�panion he just wanted to go home and was not afraid to die and face God. A memorial will
                        be preached the last of July and the first of August in 1965, with Elders Troy Nickles, Burton
                        Howard and others.</p>

                        1884 to Harmon and Juda Prater, deceased, April 21, 1963, being 79 years and 1 month old at her
                        passing. Sister Nora was married to George Prater, and to this union was born three children:
                        two boys and one girl, Harmon Prater, Blue River, Ky., Her�bert Prater, West Prestonsburg, KY.;
                        Alafair Gibson, Willard, Ohio. She leaves twelve grandchildren and five great grand�children to
                        mourn her loss. Sister Nora has a father and a mother and three brothers and one sister that has
                        passed on before her to their home beyond this veil of tears and we feel she has joined them
                        where there is no more sickness or pain to bear. Sister Nora has also left two brothers living,
                        Newman Prater of Greenup, Ky., and J. R. Prater of Attica, Ohio. She leaves four living sisters,
                        S a r a h Prater, Mary Prater, Martha Prater, and Lolia Ousley all of Hueysville, Ky. and also a
                        host of friends and relatives to mourn her loss. Sister Nora was loved by all who knew her and
                        she is missed at the Old Philadelphia Regular Baptist Church where she was a member for over
                        forty years. We feel that our loss is heaven�s gain. Sister Nora was a great friend in time of
                        sickness. She was a Mid-wife and was always ready to minister to the sick and ready to lend a
                        help�ing hand, but now she is gone to enjoy that happy home that Jesus said he would go and
                        prepare for his children. A few words to Sister Nora�s children - you should be so glad of those
                        sweet words she said while dying - �I am going Home�. Alaf air, I feel you will meet mother
                        again some day, and Harmon, you and Herbert can too, if you haven�t already repented. If you
                        haven�t repented, repent and be born again, and I trust that you will.</p>

                    <p><strong>BERRY TACKETT</strong>&nbsp; While sitting here alone, if the Lord will give me the mind
                        and strength, I will try to write a short sketch of the life of my loving husband, Berry
                        Tackett. He was the son of Andy and Hannah Tackett. He was born April 29, 1910. He died April
                        28, 1964, liked one day being 54 years old when sweet Jesus sent and took him home to live with
                        his daddy that left him in 1949. He was first married to Elvie Hamilton in July 1928. To this
                        union was born 6 children, 4 daughters and 2 sons. His companion and one daughter preceded him
                        in death. Then he was married the second time to Mahala Tackett in July, 1942. Unto this union
                        was born 3 children, 2 sons and 1 daughter, which the Lord loved our baby better than we did and
                        took it when it was only 3 weeks old. So I be�lieve that Berry is resting with the rest of the
                        family that God has taken away from us. He leaves a lonesome wife, 3 girls, 4 boys, a sweet
                        mother and 23 grandchildren, also a host of friends to mourn with us. Berry loved every body.
                        While he was in the hospital he had so m a n y visitors, the nurses said he had more friends
                        than anybody. Berry didn�t belong to the church, but he loved the Baptist family. We always went
                        to church. We loved to go to church. It Was for a while before Berry took sick that he worked so
                        hard that he wanted to stay at home and rest. But still he would talk about not going to church.
                        He told me and his mother not long before he died that he would like for the good Lord to let
                        him live long enough to tell the people what he had done for him. He said with his sweet
                        trembling voice that he had a better home to go to. He told his mother that him and her was
                        standing on a little platform and a ladder to it and one of the others had to climb that ladder.
                        So I feel like that sweet Jesus sent one of his Angels to climb the ladder with him. He loved
                        his family so much that he wanted them to stay around him where he could see them at all times.
                        He would say it done him good for any of us to have our hands on him. He had so much faith he
                        wanted some of the good people to stay with him so they could put their hands.. on him and try
                        on him. Seems like it would give him ease. He enjoyed people coming in and talking with him. Old
                        brother Jerry Hall and some of the other good people stayed Sunday and Monday night with him.
                        Jerry got up at mid night and started home. He looked up at Jerry and said with a very weak
                        voice, Jerry if you leave me I, will be dead before daylight. So Jerry stayed with him. He hated
                        to leave his family so bad on Monday night before he died he called all his children and talked
                        to them he told them he was going to Heaven and for them not to put it off to late to live
                        right. I was standing at his back with my hands on his head he looked up at me and said to me,
                        my sweet wife will you meet me in Heaven? I told him yes I don�t feel like there is anything in
                        between me and my Lord and I believe me and Berry will live together again. We did everything
                        that we could do for him. All the children were good to stay and did every thing that their
                        daddy wanted them to do. I stood by him and held to his hand just as long as I could stand it.
                        It was hard to do but I knew that was what he wanted the last word I could under�stand him. He
                        was trying to call my name. He would say my sweet mother. She stayed with him day and night.
                        There are a lot of good things to say but I want to say Mother and dear sweet children we can�t
                        stand by and fan daddy any more, but we can live a good Christian life and live for the Lord.
                        Then when we leave here we can live with Daddy where we will never be hungry for God is the same
                        yesterday, today, and forever and Chaugheth nat. May I close his obituary by quoting here a poem
                        which seems so fitting and appropriate to our memory of the sweetest husband and Daddy of all.

                        try to write an obituary of our b e 1 o v e d mother and grandmother Darcus Gayheart for mama
                        and their other children. She was born June 16, 1877, and departed this life September 25, 1962.
                        She was married to Richard Gayheart (deceased) in 1892. To this union was born five children,
                        three boys and two girls, Millie Hall, Lum Gayheart, Melda I-JaIl, Milford Gayheart. and Granny
                        joined the Old Regular Bobby Gayheart, deceased. Baptist Church in September of 19~7. She loved
                        to go to church so much. She believed in filling her seat as long as she was able to get there.
                        She was afflicted for several years before she died. She loved all her brethren and sisters so
                        much and would send for them to come and preach and sing for her. Seems like she would get so
                        happy. I have seen her unable to get over the floor by herself and some of us would hold her up
                        while she shouted and praised the Lord. She was a firm believer in the old time doctrine. She
                        told me so many wonderful things. One thing she told me so many times that she didn�t believe
                        Brother Troy would tell the church any�thing wrong. She talked to her children many times and
                        beg�ged them to fall out with sin and live for the Lord. Children if you want to see mother
                        again be ready to meet her when the Lord comes again. Milford remember how often mother talked
                        to you and begged you to live for the Lord. Get ready to meet her. She told us so many times she
                        didn�t mind dying that she was going to a better home. Granny loved all her good friends so
                        much. Sadly missed by her children and grand�children.&nbsp; Written by her lonely grand

                        try to write an obituary of my dear beloved husband, to wit: Ora Hamilton. lie was the son of
                        Robert&nbsp; Hamilton and Clearinda Hall Hamilton. Brother Ora was born May 5, 1896 and departed
                        this life February 23, 1964, making his ~s Lay here on earth 68 years, 8 months and 18 days. He
                        and his companion joined the Old Regular Baptisit Church ~bout 7 years ago. He leaves here on
                        earth to mourn his loss two sons, Caner Ham�ilton of Apple Creek, Ohio and Ronnie Hamilton, an
                        adopted son, of GaIveston~ Ky., and many other friends. He said about three weeks before he died
                        he talked all night with the Lord and said he would call him when he needed him. He never
                        .lingered sick very long, and he cer�tainly did bear his sickness with patience. He filled his
                        seat at the old church when he was able to go. He leaves here on earth one Brother and three
                        sisters to mourn his loss, Troy Hamilton, Rosy Adkins and Martha Hall all of Galveston, Ky. and
                        Maudie Hunter of Printer, Ky. Brother Bert Conn was here on Saturday before he died on Sunday
                        morning. He was talking with him and when he started to leave he told Brother Bert he wanted him
                        to come back and have church for him and he died on Sunday morning between the hour of four and
                        five o'clock. The death angel came after him. Oh, we hated to give him up. When he died he was
                        clapping his hands and shouting. Oh how we all do miss him and hated to give him up, but we feel
                        our loss is Heaven's gain. We feel that some day we will all be together again where we won�t
                        have to part any more. We feel that when king Jesus comes again to gather his children here on
                        earth and take them home Brother Ora will be in that number. The Bible says blessed and holy is
                        he that has a part in the first resurrection for on such the second death has no powed and we
                        believe by the life Brother Ora lived while here on earth he will be in that number. His funeral
                        will be preached the fifth Saturday and Sunday in August 1964. Every body is invited to
                        come.&nbsp;</p>

                        deceased this life May 18, 1962, making his stay on earth 81 years, 9 months, and 8 days. He
                        joined the Old Regular Baptist Church in 1927, lived a devoted and faithful m e m b e r until
                        death. A 1 w a y s attending church when able, he was in bad health for some time. He was
                        married to Mary Ramsey, 57 years ago. To this union was born 9 children, 6 preceding him in
                        death, leav�ing 3 to mourn his loss. He also had a step-son and step�daughter, 12 grandchildren,

                        a good member and the children a good father. We�ll say to the children that are still in sin,

                        be separated anymore. A precious one from us is gone, a voice we loved is still, a place is
                        vacant in our home, that never can be filled.&nbsp;</p>

                        heartedness that we will try to write an obituary of our dear deceased mother and wife, Mayte B.
                        Conn. She was the daughter of Wesley Boyd and Clarinda Smiley, born Dec. 20, 1893, and departed
                        this life April 24, 1964, at the age of 70 years, 4 months and 4 days. She was married to
                        Charlie Conn April 17, 1918. To this union was born nine children, one preceding her in death,
                        Curtus Conn, killed in service December 25, 1944. Mother leaves to mourn her loss, her husband,
                        Charlie Conn, and 6 boys, to wit, Travis, James, Norman, Crit, Hershel and W. B. 2 daughters,
                        Myrtle and June. Mother also leaves to mourn her loss 25 grandchildren and 2
                        great-grandchildren, 6 brothers, one preceding her in death, Jim Boyd. The others are, Worley.
                        Boyd, Brad Boyd, A. M. Boyd, Palmer Boyd and Arthur Boyd. Three sisters; Offie Bailey, Salley
                        Click and Minervia Robinette. She also leaves a host of friends and relatives, I trust that our
                        loss is heaven�s gain. Mother joined the Old Regular Baptist Church the first Saturday in June,
                        1934, and was baptized by Elder Cola Conn. From that d a y on mother lived a faithful life.
                        Mother was always kind to her children and faithful to Daddy. She enjoyed seeing her children
                        come back home after they had gone out on their own. Many week - ends she would have all her
                        family with her. Mother was sick a good part of her latter life and was unable to attend church,
                        but she enjoyed so much to hear her brothers preach the gospel and sing the old songs of Zion. I
                        feel that mother is now resting in her eternal home with her High and Mighty Master. Children if
                        we ever want to meet Mother again we will have to give up our worldly pleasures and profess a
                        hope in a Higher Power.&nbsp; </p>

                        that we attempt to write the obituary of our Father, husband, and Father-in-law, Sherm Ray. He
                        was born March 14, 1883 and departed this life August 13, 1963; making his stay on earth 80
                        years, 4 months, and 29 days. He was the son of Ely Ray and Susan Clay Ray. He was married to
                        Rosie Trick about the year of 1905. Unto his union there was born nine children, four boys and
                        five girls. Six preceded him in death and one boy, Clyde, passed away about six weeks after he
                        did. That leaves two daughters, Martha Justice and Mary Compton, his good wife, and me his
                        daughter-in-law, nine grandchildren, twenty-four great grandchildren, and many, many good
                        friends to mourn his death. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church on July 13, 1963, and was
                        baptized on Sunday July 14, 1963, by Whipple Reynolds and Bill Hall. One day before he joined
                        the church to told his wife he wanted to talk to her ond she asked him what he wanted and he
                        said I am not satisfied this way, I want to have Church here at home. We asked him when he
                        wanted Church and he said next Saturday. So we had a called meeting here at home and he joined
                        the Church. He had been sick for a long time with heart disease. Papa was always good to
                        everybody and he always wanted everybody to come and eat with him. He would give the poor and
                        needy the last dollar he had. We were broken hearted to see him depart from us, but mortal man
                        cannot stop the hand of death or the will of God, when he reaches forth his long and fruitful
                        life, a long stop over here on earth in a earthly home. And it is not for his soul that we weep
                        but for the belief that when he passed beyond this realm of pain and suffering he entered the
                        door of God�s eternal kingdom. He told his daughter not many weeks before he passed away that he
                        was ready to die, that there was nothing in his way. His two daughters and wife have professed a
                        hope in Christ. We miss Papa very much, his place at home is vacant and at Church, but we feel
                        our loss is Heaven�s Eternal gain.&nbsp;</p>

                        Mother and Father, I will try in my weakness to write in regard to my Mother and Fath�er�s life.
                        My Mother, Mrs. Sallie Scott Griffith was born September 21, 1888 and departed this life
                        November 25, 1962 being 74 years and a few days old. Mother was the daughter of Dan Scott and
                        Sarah Hoover Scott of Garrett, Kentucky. My Father, Harrison Grif�fith was born May 29, 1884 and
                        departed this life April 20, 1964. Dad was the son of Jim Griffith and Betty Hicks Griffith of
                        West Virginia at Big Creek. Dad and Mother were married early in life and to this union ten
                        children were born of which four proceeded Dad and Mother in death. The remaining children are
                        Richard Griffith of Tekonsha, Michigan, Sol Griffith of Garrett, Kentucky, Mrs. Sarah Price,
                        Rushville, Indiana, Mrs. Sadie Mink, Indianapolis, Indiana, Mrs. Dolly Hunter and Mrs. Harvey,
                        both of Dema, Kentucky. Mother and Dad were both members of the Old Time Regular Baptist Church
                        at Stone Coal and served the Lord faithful some forty five years until their death. Mother and
                        Dad was loved by all who knew them and I can say with great confidence that their doors were
                        always open to the people of God. Ican remember Mother coming to the old church at Stone Coal
                        and shout the praises of God as soon as she entered the church door. The many friends that knew
                        Mother had great confidence in her and often they would come to their little home on Stone Coal
                        and have Mother to pray for them and try on them that her great faith in the creator would help
                        to relieve their suffering. To the children that remain to walk this life, I want all of you to
                        follow in the foot steps and after the same example �left you by Dad and Mother. I believe with
                        my whole heart that Mother and Dad has left a world of suffering and gone on to receive their
                        crown of glory which the Lord promised to every one who would love and serve him. Dad and Mother
                        were both poor people and could not leave us any wealth but I had much rather have the
                        con�fidence that Mother and Dad are resting in the hands of sweet Jesus, than to have inherited
                        a mansion from them. Dear children remember the many good things that Mother and Dad taught us
                        when we were around the old fire place at home. I am sure that you want to see them again and my
                        advice to each of you if you haven�t made your peace calling and election sure with God ... I
                        beg to each of you close in to the offered mercies of God and let all of us be united together
                        around God�s great throne with the one who gave his life for us all ... Ye must be born
                        again...&nbsp;</p>

                        Willie lost a little girl in a few weeks after she had lost her late husband. She leaves three
                        boys, one step son, and five girls. Children, I know you will shed many tears as you think ~ of
                        a sweet and loving mother. We will miss her so much in this world. I do hope you will make the
                        choice mother made. ~ She came and said, �I feel the Lord has forgive me of my sins�, and she
                        warned to be baptized. She joined the Old Regular Baptist January 27, 1952. It was a cold winter
                        day, but I feel God had warmed her soul with eternal love. Your mother�s troubles were great in
                        this world, and I feel they have turned to joy. May God help those that have not got Jesus to
                        pardon their sins. It i�s the most precious thing of all that you choose the good part that
                        leads to eternal love. God said, �I give eternal life.� Edward Jr. and Sue, I will pray for you,
                        but most of all children, live like mother would want you to, and prepare to meet her in

                        earth one hundred one years and twenty eight days. He was first married to Laura Irick who
                        preceded him in death. Born to that union were n i n e children, six of which preceded him in
                        death. Surviving are Mrs. H. R. Fleming of Russel Point, Ohio, Mrs. R. M. Stafford of Russel
                        Point, Ohio, and Bill McCown of Ashland, Kentucky. On March 29, 1905 he was married to Anna Ray.
                        Born to that union were two daughters. Mrs. Rush Thomas, who preceded him in death, and Mrs.
                        Maddison Branham who resides at Robinson Creek, Ky. He leaves to mourn his passing his wife, one

                        Charlie Roberts. He lived true to his profession until death. May I say to his relation at large
                        that if you want to see Brother James again you will have to pray to the same God that he prayed
                        to. The Bible says �Except you believe that I am He, ye shall die in your sins, and where I am
                        ye can not Come�.</p>

                    <p><strong>MARION SLONE</strong>&nbsp; [Photo Not Available]&nbsp; By request of the family, I will
                        attempt to write a short sketch of the life and death of a beloved brother in the Lord. Brother
                        Marion Slone was born November 11, 1891, the son of Adam (Ad) and Tena Slone. On July 12, 1912,
                        he was united in marriage to Rosetta Short, and to this union was born eight children; four boys
                        and four girls. One boy preceded him in death, leaving seven 3hildren, a great number of
                        grandchildren, a dear compan�ion, and a multitude of friends to mourn his passing. Brother
                        Marion joined the Mount Olive Church of Old Regular Baptist the first Sat�urday in April, 1961,
                        and I feel that he lived a good Christian life until his death. He bore the fruits of love and
                        charity within the church and among his neighbors. It gave him great pleasure for his brothers
                        and sisters of the church to come in his home and hold services for him. He seemed to take a
                        special delight in feeding the congregation, and was not satisfied until everyone had eaten. On
                        November 11, on his 72nd birthday, he was stricken down with a stroke, and was never able to
                        speak again. A few days later he was taken to Mount Mary�s Hospital, Hazard, Ky. On the Sunday
                        before he died, I, (the writer) went to visit him. When I went in, he was lying with his eyes
                        closed, and it looked as if he could not live long. I asked the family if they thought he
                        recognized anyone; they said they did not. I was very much grieved because I wanted him to know
                        that I was there. With a heavy heart I walked out in the hail and began to ask God if it was his
                        will He would let Brother Marion understand that I was there. Then I went back inside, stooped
                        over the bed and said �Brother Marion,� he did not seem to notice, so I spoke again, �Brother
                        Marion, open your eyes and see if you know me.� As soon as I had spoken, he opened his eyes,
                        cast them upon me, and his lips began to tremble. He raised up his arm as if to embrace me. This
                        makes me believe that God answered my prayers and let him realize that I was there. On November
                        27, 1963, the terrible monster, death, entered the hospital and took Brother Marion away. Though
                        his family, friends, and the church greatly miss his presence among us, we rest in hope that he
                        gained that haven of rest beyond this vale of tears. I would like to say to his children:
                        Children, your Daddy prayed for you when you were gone from home, He begged God to let you
                        return safely. Children, if you could only see the things that are prepared for your Daddy and
                        all that loves and serves the Lord, you would try to be better boys and girls and meet your Papa
                        in a better world.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>G. J. �BUD� SLONE</strong>&nbsp; [Photo Not Available]&nbsp; By request of the family, I
                        will try to write a short sketch of the life of a dear brother in the Lord. Brother G. J. �Bud�
                        Slone was born Feb.11, 1883, the son of Billie and Martha Slone, and departed this life Oct. 13,
                        1963. In the year of 1902 he was united in marriage to Hannah Elizabeth Slone, and to this union
                        was born seven children: Canton of Lexington, Ky. Cephas, Emmitt, and Hulda of Pippa Passes,
                        Ky., Bertha of St. Marys, Ohio and Dora of Wauseon, Ohio; one girl, Tina, died in infancy.
                        Brother Bud�s companion, also, answered the summons of death, and in the year of 1920, he was
                        married to Elizabeth� Slone; they had one son, Berlin Slone of Pippa Passes, Ky. So, Brother Bud
                        leaves seven children, 25 grandchildren, 45 great grandchildren, 2 great- great-grandchildren
                        and a dear companion to mourn his pass�ing. In 1939 Brother Bud joined the Mount Olive Church of
                        Old Regular Baptist. He preached for. several years, but was never ordained for the ministry. He
                        was ordained as a deacon, and fulfilled the qual�ifications in a conscientious and upright
                        manner. He at�tended church as long as he was able, and was faithful to visit the sick. I have
                        seen him many times tottering along the road on his cane, to visit some sick neighbor, and I
                        have honestly thought that the person he was going to see was more able to visit than he was.
                        Brother Bud, like all good Christians, received some criticisms, but he would say, �It is not
                        what people say about you that counts, it is what God knows about you. While they�re talking
                        about me, they�re letting somebody else alone�. Finally the terrible grip of cancer was fastened
                        upon the frail body of Brother Bud, and he was stricken down to bed, but he continued to plead
                        and counsel young and old to seek for a better life. I believe one of the greatest tributes to
                        Brother Bud was the confidence and respect shown to him by the younger people. After he got
                        beyond speaking they would come in and gaze sorrowfully down at him as if to acknowledge that
                        they were losing a dear friend. There are many wonderful things I could say about Brother Bud,
                        but space will not permit, so I will conclude this obituary by saying to his family: I know that
                        you miss your Daddy, and nothing will ever be the same as it was when he was with you, but try
                        to comfort yourself with the hope which he left you. I firmly believe that in his dying moment,
                        he viewed his eternal happiness; the refuge of the weary pilgrim. If any of you are still out in
                        sin, let me be~ you to get ready to walk with Brother Bud in that shining city where separation
                        cannot come and heartaches are no more.</p>

                        will try to write an obituary of Brother T. W. Stephens. In early life he married Mary Tussy,
                        and to this union was born 8 children, 5 boys and 3 girls. Later he married Orville Johnson, to
                        this union was born one son. His last marriage was to Melvina Thornsberry, who lives to mourn
                        his loss. Iwant to say to his 9 chil�dren and his good wife, that I t)elieve by the life he
                        lived and ~he Hope that he professed \vhile living, that he is just resting until the morning of
                        the Ressurection, w h e n he shall be called home to Heaven to live with all the true chil�dren
                        of God. The 14 years that I knew him I found him to be a very humble and kind man. His
                        con�versation was always of a Godly sort. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church in the year
                        of 1950, and was faithful to fill his seat. Though we miss him here on earth, we are glad that
                        he is free from pain and the great burdens that the true children of God has to bear while
                        traveling through this weary land. I believe that our loss is Heavens gain, so sleep on Bro. Tom
                        until Christ comes to redeem us from this world of sin and trouble. </p>

                    <p><strong>JIMMY WAYNE MARTIN</strong> I feel it my duty to write a sketch of my precious grandson,
                        one so dear and near to me. Jimmy Wayne was born April 23, 1946, died Sept. 7, 1963 at the age
                        of 17 years. He was the son of Ezra and Doris Martin. He had one sister and one brother. The
                        best of all he left us a good testimony he wasn�t afraid to die. He was baptized into The First
                        Baptist Church at an early age about 14 years old. He was involved in a Motor Cycle accident. He
                        told them he was going to die to tell his Mother, and take him to the hospital and just give him
                        something to relieve him and let him go on. He asked them to pray for him and he prayed with
                        them. He told his Mother and others just a short time before he wasn�t afraid to die, he
                        wouldn�t care to go on, that this was a wicked old world to live in so much trouble. The life he
                        lived and the way he talked, we don�t worry about his soul, only the great loss. He was the
                        flower of our home. It is so hard on us to give him up. I can see now what Wayne meant when he
                        said I hate to leave you here, you have so much trouble. Wayne had only been gone seven months
                        when Jimmy Wayne left us. I have dreamed of seeing them together looking so happy and smiling. I
                        feel, they are together. I get home sick to go to heaven I want to go and see them. I have so
                        much trouble and hardships here. I want to say to Ezra and Doris just press on, Jimmy is gone
                        never to return any more in our home buy&nbsp; by the grace of God we can go to him to never
                        have to part no more.</p>

                        I will try to write an obituary of my sweet and be- 1 o v e d companion, Virginia Elouise
                        Sandefur Stratton. She was born September 4, 1920 and departed this life July 1, 1964. She was
                        the daughter of James L. and Henrietta Pauley Sandefur. She was married to John George Stratton
                        January 22, 1944 and to this union were born 8 daughters: Gladys Irene, Wanda Sue, Rita Gay,
                        Neitha, Loretta, Sandra, Lenetta, and Kay which are all at home. She has six brothers: Robert
                        Sandefur, Sidney, Kentucky; James L. Sandefur, Jr. Portsmouth, Virginia; Carmen Sandefur,
                        Norfolk, Virginia; Melville Sandefur, Portsmouth, Virginia; T/Sgt. Winifred Sandefur, Air Force
                        Homestead, Florida, and Henry Sandefur, Portsmouth, Virginia. Three sisters: Mrs. Susie Chapman,
                        Ferndale, Michigan; Miss Roberta Sandefur, Forest Hills, Kentucky, and Mrs. Ruby Mozis, Hopkins,
                        Minnesota, and her mother and father James L. and Henrietta Sandefur who reside at Sidney,
                        Kentucky. Elouise joined the Old Regular Baptist Church March 9, 1947, and was a faithful member
                        to attend church as long as she was able. The good life she lived at home, in the church, before
                        her neighbors and the world I believe proved that she was born again, and that in the hour and
                        article of death that she just went to sleep in the arms of Jesus. If it could have been God�s
                        will I wanted her to stay with me and the children a little longer and I prayed to this end, but
                        Jesus seen cause to call her home to Glory. So Friends, Neighbors, and children remember the
                        life that Elouise lived, and when Christ visits you and bids you to accept Him as your personal
                        Savior don�t turn him away. So pray that God�s will be done and may He prosper and Bless the Old
                        Regular Baptist Church.</p>

                        to write an obituary of my sweet mother, if the good Lord will help me and hold me up. Victoria
                        Tackett was born February 29th. She was 67 years, 9 months, and two days old. She left us the
                        9th f December, 1963. She left 3 girls in this world that if we are what we profess to be I
                        be�lieve w e will meet mother again and one boy that I sure love with all my heart but I believe
                        if he ever sees mother again he will have to repent and look to the same God that mother looked
                        to and I sure hope that he will do so before it is too late. Mother loved him so much and she
                        told me after she got, bad off if she didn�t never get to talk to him any more for me to tell
                        him to meet her in a better world and she didn�t never get to see him but I believe if he will
                        be a good boy and repent he can live with mother where they will be happy together and I feel
                        deep down in this sole of mine I will see mother again in a place where we will be happy and
                        won�t have to part no more, but I get lonesome in my home thinking of mother. I waited on her so
                        long, but I believe the good Lord held me up to wait on my little poor sweet mother. She would
                        say to me so many times God bless you, Lona and I believe that come from her heart and I feel
                        that the good Lord answered her. So I will close with tears in my eyes, but I believe some day
                        they will be wiped away. The other children�s~ names are Virtie Ray, Vesta Newsome and Efford

                        wasn�t afraid to die because she was going Home. We believe the pearly gates swung open wide and

                        was a faithful member of the Old Regular Baptist Church of Caney Creek for over 20 years. She
                        attended regularly as long as she was able. Our hearts are empty without her presence but we
                        must fill the emptiness with the hope of being with her throughout eternity in Heaven. Dear Lord
                        we all truly thank you for giving us such a loving Christian Mother. We didn�t realize how much
                        we loved her until you took her to the home she longed for. May our family circle not be broken
                        when you call all of your children home. She always prayed that the Lord would take her to �her
                        eternal home before she had to give up one of her children and that they all would join her in
                        that heavenly home on High. Our Heavenly Father may her prayers be answered.&nbsp;</p>

                        heart, I will try to write an obituary of my beloved daddy, Jackson Kidd. He was born February
                        12, 1892, and de�ceased from this life May 18, 1964, thus making his stay here on earth 72
                        years, ~5 months, and 6 days. He was the son of Mac and Elizabeth Case Kidd. He leaves two
                        brothers, Frank of Honaker, Ky., and Marion of Drift, Ky. In his early life, he was mar�ried to
                        Octavia Adams Kidd. Unto this union was born 12 children, two of whom preced�ed him in death.
                        Surviving are Charles Kidd of Rochester, Ohio; Everee Kidd, Walter Kidd, and Virginia Evans of
                        Cleveland, Ohio; Fay Shelton and James Kidd of San Raphael, California; Don, Raymond, Jerry, and
                        Gay all of Drift, Ky. He also had 14 grandchildren. Daddy joined the Old Regular Baptist Church
                        on the third Saturday in April of 1963 and was baptized May 18, 1963. The Old Beaver Church can
                        say they have lost a true and faithful member. We sure do miss him, but we have no worry about
                        his soul. Just the Monday before his death, he told me he knew he didn�t have long to live. He
                        told me who he wanted to preach over him and where be wanted to be buried. He said he had also
                        told Brother John and Sister Janie Pack this too. Mommy did her best to carry out his request. I
                        would like to say to my brothers and sisters, �Don�t forget the good council Daddy gave us. If
                        you want to see Daddy again you will have to fall out with sin and be born again. Follow in
                        Daddy�s footsteps, for he chose a good path for us to follow. I don�t worry about his soul. I
                        believe God sent a band of Angels to take him to that beautiful home on high where is no
                        trouble, pain, death, just peace, joy, and happiness forever. I feel that he is singing around
                        God�s throne.&nbsp;</p>

                        thoughts and fond memories I will write an obituary of my sister, Dona Newsome, born Dec. 13,
                        1900; died July 10, 1964. She was the daughter of Robert Hall and Retta Hop�kins Hall, and was
                        married to Milford Newsome in 1919, who departed this life 1928. The1y were the parents of three
                        children: Mrs. Edgar Jones, Mrs. Arnold Turner and Elmer Newsome. Dona joined the Regular
                        Baptist Church Nov. 1942, and lived a faithful and devoted life while here on earth. She was not
                        wise in her own conceit, but lived an unselfish life and close to God. She was tolerant of
                        people who did not look, think, act, and believe as she did and was able to accept those people
                        for the fine qualities they possessed. Doria did not like self-pity, for it destroys fine
                        character; she had a true love for humanity in her heart and was always doing things for others.
                        Jesus says, �Fear Not.� and that was the way she lived. She would not allow fear to come in, but
                        surrendered it to God. She did not show an inner strain or a lack of confidence and poise. Doria
                        had faith which gave her power, love, cheerfulness, compassion, friendliness, gen�erosity,
                        tolerance, and justice. She seemed to use herself as a �measuring rule� to find out the
                        dimensions of those with whom she came in contact. She thought human sight was never clear
                        enough to justify in passing judgment; for we can not possibly know all that lies back of
                        another�s actions.</p>

                        sadness that I try to write an obituary of a dear brother in the Lord. Thomas Hall, better known
                        as �Scorcher�, the son of Elder Henry Hall was born April 16, 1882 and departed this life August
                        20, 1964, making his stay here 82 years, 4 months and 4 days. He joined the Joppa Church of Old
                        Regular Baptist the first Saturday in May, 1900. He was baptized by his father Elder Henry Hall.
                        He was or�dained as a Ye-a c o n of the Joppa Church in the year of 1928 and served faithfully
                        un�til death. He was married to Dallah Osborn, November 12, 1903 and to this union no children
                        were born. After the death of his first wife July 26, 1959, he was married to Dorothy Pres�ton,
                        and to this union no chil�dren were born. The Joppa Church has lost its oldest member and he
                        will l)e sadly missed. He left to mourn his passing, his widow, I)orothy, three brothers, and
                        two sisters, names being: Elder Jerry Hall, Brack Hall, McClellen Hall, Nancy Mullins, Rhodina
                        Mullins. Also to mourn him are 9 step-children, 23 step-grandchildren, and a host of relatives
                        and friends. We feel sure that our loss is Heaven�s gain. To the step�children, you have lost a
                        wonderful step-father, the commun�ity of Melvin and around have lost a good neighbor and
                        citizen, and the Old Joppa Church lost a faithful member. Brother �Scorcher� is now resting from
                        his labors and waiting for his body to be ransomed from the grave so that he may go to that Home
                        of Many Mansions eternally in the skies.&nbsp;</p>

                        1886, being 76 years, 1 month, and 6 days old. He was the son of the late Martin and Jane
                        Winters Wright, and deceased January 30, 1963. He was a faithful husband and a good father to
                        his family and gave his children good advice. He was the father of five children, three boys and
                        two girls, he also has twelve grandchildren. He joined th4t Regular Baptist Church 8 years ago
                        and was baptized b~ Brothers Squire Hamilton and Jesse Osborn. He attended church when he was
                        able but could not walk good, and have to use a walker. He enjoyed being with his brethren and
                        sisters in the Lord ~He would talk with his children and me that when the Lord called him he was
                        ready to go. And children if you want to see daddy again you will have to make peace with God
                        and2 you can see him again. Our home is sad and lonely with grief which fill every heart. We
                        hope to meet dear father and never more part.&nbsp;</p>

                        loved. I hope the good Lord will direct my mind while I write of Brother Richard Bentley. He was
                        working for his family when death came and cut down one of the it trees in the family of life on
                        May 11, 1964 at the age of 561 years, 4 months and 16 days. He was the son of Brack and Sally
                        Hughes Bentley; both of whom preceded him in death: He leaves his wife and five children and six
                        grandchildren to mourn his .loss. He belonged to the Stone Coal Church twenty-six years. He was
                        married in 1927 to Edna Craft. To this union were born seven children; four girls and three
                        boys. Two girls 7 preceded him in death. I baptized Brother Richard twenty-six years ago. Let us
                        not think of him being gone. He has just crossed on before to rest. He was loved by all who knew
                        him. He was humble and kind to everyone. He was my neighbor. We miss him so much. We cannot
                        understand now the beauty of Heaven. We will know more about it when we get over there and see
                        Jesus and all of the redeemed and we hope to see Brother Richard in that number and we will all
                        be happy over there.&nbsp;</p>

                        Saturday evening October 26, 1963 about the hour of 2:50 p.m., making her stay 40 years and 10
                        days. She was the daughter of Samuel and Sindy Elswick, Ida was married to Preston Tackett and
                        to this family was born four children, two boys, Roger C. Tackett and Donald G. Tackett and two
                        girls Charlotte K. Tackett and Sundra G. Tackett all at home. She leaves to mourn her passing a
                        devoted husband who tried to help her, four children, six sisters, one brother, and her parents.
                        Ida was sick the biggest part of her life with cancer, the good part was that she joined the Old
                        Regular Baptist the fourth Saturday in October 1953, she was a good member until death, she
                        lifted her letter from the Longfork Church to come to Chicago to help organize the Little Ellen
                        Church and did all she could, she laid in bed and sold things, for that reason I think the
                        church will go on. She lived a life that who all knew her loved her and she had many friends

                        born the 29th day of January, 1901. Brother Lee joined the Old Regular Baptist Church of Little
                        Rock in 1960, and was baptized in January of the same year by Elder Johnie Jones. He seemed to
                        be well pleased with his fellow�ship and when his brother and sisters came to see him, he would
                        rejoice. I can truthfully say that he was always a good friend of mine as well as all of his
                        other brothers and sisters. Brother Lee worked hard for his family as long as he was able and he
                        was always pleased when people came to see him. Now children and mother, daddy is gone and he
                        cannot come to you, but by the grace of God you can meet him someday. I love brother Lee�s
                        family because they were all so good to him, and someday I hope they will meet him in a better
                        world. I am sure they can do this because the good Lord never turns any one away that comes to
                        him in faith. I feel that our church has lost a good member and I a good friend. I have a hope
                        that someday I can meet him in a better world beyond this one here below. There no nature ~n
                        ever enter and all will be peace, joy, and love, and all will be of one mind. Brother Lee�s
                        Memorial will be preached on Buckingham Cemetery the third Saturday and Sunday in July of 1965,
                        by Johnie Jones, Oliver Meade, Joe Burkes, Robert Bates, Walter Burkes, and Trip Hall.&nbsp;

                        Robinson Hoover. She was born Dec. 17, 1900, she diel Feb. 26, 1963 making her stay on earth 62
                        years, 2 months, and 9 days. She was the daughter of Newt and Betty Robinson� She was married to
                        Granville Hoover in 1917, to this union was born 11 children, 4 preceded her in death, leaving 6
                        sons and 1 daughter and husband to mourn her loss. Her Sons are Ray and Clyde of LaGrange, Ohio;
                        Lester and Elmer of Wayne, Michigan; Willie at Garret, KY.; and Jackie home with their Dad, and
                        one daughter, Mrs. Delbert Castle of Wayland, Ky. A host of grandchildren and friends and
                        neighbors, three sisters and one brother to mourn her loss. Mom~ joined the Old Stonecoal Church
                        of Regular Baptist at Garret, Ky. May 2, 1949 and was baptized by Bro. Earl Howard. Mom was sick
                        and afflicted for many years, her condition was such that she couldn�t fill her seat as often as
                        she desired to, but she loved to hear the gospel preached in its sweetness and power, which
                        caused her to rejoice in the God of her salvation, giving praises and glory unto the one who had
                        washed her soul in His blood and made her an heir of God and joint heir with Jesus. When I would
                        go home for a visit mom would ask me to sing and hold prayer and she would be so happy, that the
                        tears would fall from her face as she clapped her hands and praised God, she would say, �How
                        happy I would be if I could have all of my children to walk with me�. The last letter I got from
                        mom she was in the hospital waiting to be operated on. She said, �Ray I feel my way is clear
                        with the good Lord. Eleven days later they called us mom was gone. God had seen that mom has
                        suffered enough in this world of sorrow and troubles, and had called her home to rest from all
                        her toils. No more to know the sorrows of this earth. Not long before Mom had to go into the
                        hospital, she was unable to leave home, being left alone while the family was away, her sister
                        went to see about her and she said, �Kate I have shouted all over the yard today. Mom is
                        re�joicing, in the presence of her King now, no more to be parted from his joy. So I feel to say
                        to the rest of the family, if you ever expect to see mom again, you have to serve the same God
                        mom did. She bowed humbley to his will and guidiance and so you will have to do the same. I
                        expect to see Mom again soon, for I have the sweet witness in my soul that Mom�s Shepherd is
                        mine also. Daddy don�t wait too long, you are nearing the end of your stay here on earth, make
                        preparation if you expect to see mom again. I hope the family circle will not be unbroken. I
                        trust by the Grace of God the rest of the family will accept God�s call and be ready when death
                        comes.&nbsp; </p>

                        stay on earth 74 years, 9 months, and 6 days. She was united in marriage to Elder Jerry Campbell
                        November 30, 1931, and they seemed to live a well-devoted life together. Rean had been sick for
                        a long time with sugar diabetes and high blood and in much pain. She was always kind to
                        everyone. I visited with them several times and she told me the hardest thing that she now had
                        to contend with was the diet the doctor had her on and not being able to help Brother Jerry with
                        the work. The last week of Rean�s life was in the Lady of the Way Hospital in Martin, Kentucky
                        and she prayed all the time. Two days before she died, she said she saw her father and mother
                        and brother and sister coming to take her home.. Rean had never joined the Church but she always
                        held up for the Old Regular Baptist so we believe from the testimony she left that in the
                        resurrection morning her body will come from the grave and reunite with the soul and then go
                        home to sing and praise the Lord forever and forever.&nbsp;</p>

                        Newsome, Estil Newsome, Tivis Newsome, Anthony Newsome, Anderson Newsome, and three sisters Jane
                        Vance, Babe Tackett, Nance Holt, four brothers Port, Johan, Bob, and Tivis. Left to mourn his
                        loss. He bore his sickness with great pride. He had a stroke the 3th day of October and was
                        taken to the hospital but nothing could be done for him. We stood by him and did all we could
                        for him but Jesus loved him best. He wanted to be baptized that was all his talk so he joined
                        the Regular Baptist Church the 16th of October 1963. He was baptized by J. L. Hamilton, Butler
                        Howell, Miford Adams, and Bill Martin. He was baptized in a sheet when we brought him back home
                        he didn�t want us to change his clothes. He said they felt so cool to him and seemed like he
                        felt so much better. So on the 18th of October, 1963 Jesus called him home to punish no more. He
                        was buried the 20th of October on the Noah Newsome Cemetery. He had 7 great-grandchildren, 48
                        grandchildren. I could write lots more but time won�t permit.&nbsp;</p>

                        years and never had a hard feeling in any way. She always met me and everybody with a smile. �By

                        troubles. I feel she had help from God. We feel that she has left a world of trouble and gone to

                    <p><strong>DAVID FAIR SLONE</strong> With much sadness, by request of the family, I will try to
                        write an obituary of a dear uncle, Fair Slone. He was the son of Elder Morgan and Susanna Slone.
                        The best we can figure he was born July 22, 1886 and deceased this life November 19, 1963, being
                        a little over 77 years old. He was married to Carrie Draughn and unto this union was born 13
                        children, 11 living and two dead. He had 22 grand�children and 9 great-grandchildren. Fair
                        joined the Ivy Point Church of the Old Regular Baptist Sept. 1960 and was baptized by Elder
                        Cephas Mosley and Sam Johnson. After Fair joined the church, he wondered why he had stayed out
                        of the church so long, feeling the Lord had forgiven him years ago. That Spirit of God had bided
                        him to come home so many times, not realizing the many Blessings he was being robbed by his
                        disobedience. But God was merciful unto him and let him live a few years in the church, in God�s
                        kingdom here on earth, where there is food for the children of God. Fair has left many good
                        memories of his life. He piled up some stones, he left some foot-steps for the children to
                        follow in, in that path of the good old way, it will lead them to that Eternal Home, whose maker
                        is God. The Lord was ever his conversation, that was all he wanted to talk about. He would get
                        so happy talking on the Bible, just like he was preaching to you. Those that have been born
                        again, their treasures are on high. The last time I visited Fair, we sat in front of the fire,
                        there in his home, and he was talking about praying for his children. He said, �As long as I
                        live I will never stop praying for them, no never, he said it won�t do to give up, for prayer
                        unlock Heaven�s Door�. He was so worried afraid they would put it off too late. No doubt there
                        has been many hours he and Carrie have sit there alone and cried over their children, as well as
                        the many hours they sung songs and talked of the Lord. I believe Fair has gone where trouble
                        sickness, sorrow can not come, where there will be no heart attacks, to call the children home
                        in sadness. But there is a voice calling to them, that they can go meet Daddy, if they will
                        repent of their sins, where there will be no separation. Those that hasn�t repented, children
                        repent now before it�s too late and while Mother is still with you to see your Christian life.
                        Oh! how happy she would be. One thing, I myself am, thankful for, that Fair didn�t have to lay
                        and suffer week after week, he was up and around his home, God seen fit to call him home, he
                        went in just a moment of time. So I believe he has just crossed over Jordan and entered into
                        that long-waited for peace and joy, where Carrie will soon go to meet him. No doubt he has said
                        many times, �how long dear Savior, how long? will it be till I can come and live with you. I am
                        looking for that day when I can say �Farewell vain world I�m going home, I feel having a witness
                        I will meet him again in a re�union of God�s children, where be no goodbyes. The last thing he
                        said to me, was if he never again was permitted to meet me here on earth, he felt we would meet
                        on High. How happy his soul must be today. So children, get ready to meet Daddy, prepare
                        yourself to live after deaths Mother is here, sow the flowers now for her, while she is still
                        with you, don�t wait till after death, your flowers to her will be repenting of your sins,
                        telling her you are going home with her. May God Bless and comfort Carrie with that Spirit from
                        on high, in her lonely hours, may he be near her, May God Bless each one of the children. May we
                        meet in that Eternal home.&nbsp;</p>

                        Perry. He was born November 8, 1894. He was married to Nancy Jane Slone in 1914, and to this
                        union was born 5 boys and 6 girls. Three boys and 3 girls preceded him in death. ~E1e joined the
                        Old Regular Baptist Church at Rebecca and lived a faithful member until death. He was strong in
                        both the Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles, and was faith�ful in attending meetings as long as
                        he was able o go, and always tried to get his children to do right. He showed the brethren how
                        much he loved them and the Church. He was sick a long time but bore it with patience. On
                        February 22, 1963, he was rushed to the Newhome Hospital, and on February 23, about 5:45 in the
                        evening God called him home to Heaven which he has prepared for all who love and serve him. He
                        leaves Sister Jane, 2 boys, and 3 girls, and many friends to mourn his loss, but our loss we
                        trust is Heaven�s gain. So children, remember papa�s prayers and meet him in Heaven.&nbsp; </p>

                    <p><strong>George Tackett</strong>, born December 31, 1878, departed this life July 3, 1964, at the
                        age of 85 years, 6 months and 2 days. He was born in Pike County, the son of the late Enon
                        <strong>and</strong> Sally Mullins Tackett, and spent his entire life in this vicin�ity. His
                        wife, Carolne Music Tackett, preceded him in death just a little over a year ago. He leaves to
                        mourn his passing one son, Donald Tackett, and four grandchildren. Mr. Tackett was a highly
                        respected citizen of the com�munity in which he lived. During his long and useful life, he has
                        removed many stumbling blocks from the paths of those who are to follow after him. He loved the
                        Lord, and was a member of this Long <strong>Fork</strong> Regular Baptist Church. Failing health
                        had prevented him from taking an active part in the Church services for some time, but he
                        patiently suffered his illness, awaiting the time the death angel should come for him. It is
                        hard for us to understand why he had to lie sick for so long before he was released from his
                        suffering, but we must trust the Master, who doeth all things well. A poet has tried to express
                        the reason in the following lines:</p>
                    <p>God hath not promised skies always blue,</p>
                    <p>Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through,</p>
                    <p>God hath not promised sun without rain,</p>

                        life May 4, 1963, at the age of 67 years, 10 months, and 22 days. She was born in Johnson
                        County, Kentucky, the daughter of the late John and Lydia Mullett Music. She leaves to mourn her
                        passing her loyal and devoted husband, George Tackett ,who shared with her life�s Joys and
                        sorrows for 23 years; one son: Donald Tackett; two brothers: Shade and Newt Music; one sister:

                        Verna Mullett; and three grandchildren. Mrs. Tackett was a devoted wife and mother. Although she
                        had been in poor health for several months, she bravely and courageously bore her illness until
                        God tenderly called her on Saturday to her reward. She had been a member of the Long Fork
                        Regular Baptist Church for 17 years. The Christian example that she set her influence, her good
                        deeds and kind words will live on in the hearts of all who knew her. The following lines are a
                        tribute to the years of marriage shared by her and George:</p>
                    <p>Down the years you�ve come together; Many happy, busy years, Filled with days of love and
                        laughter, Mixed with days of toil and tears. Dark days when you wept together For old friends
                        lost along the way; Life, when lived its fullest measure Can�t be always light and gay. But,
                        upon this day of parting, While the bells of Heaven ring, In your heart, we know you�re saying,
                        �Thanks, dear God, for everything.� �Thanks, because You zave her to me, She, who shared life�s
                        heavy load, Thanks for joys we�ve had together To the end of life�s long road.� �Thanks,
                        beiauase You said we�ll know her, When some day we meet up there, Where we�ll sing Your praise
                        forever In that Home so bright and fair.� Her only son, Donald.</p>
