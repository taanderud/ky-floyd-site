                    <p>Carl Jean Hall, son of Bro. Vernon Hall, and Melvina Hall, born Jan. 27, 1943, deceased Feb. 9,
                        1945, age two years and six days. He leaves his father and mother, one brother and two sisters
                        to mourn his loss. But our loss this Sunday morning is heaven's gain, for Jesus said, Suffer
                        little children to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                    <p>Born April 23, 1867, deceased Dec. 20, 1944, 77 years old. Married to Sam Horn in March, 1887.
                        Born to this union were eight children: Tom, William, Albert, John, Male, Ben, Mary Jane and
                        Martha, all of West Prestonsburg; also several grandchildren. Sister Horn was a faithful church
                        member for 40 years in the United Baptist Church.</p>

                    <p>MOSES RICE</p>
                    <p>It is with much sadness that we try to write a short obituary of Moses Rice. He was born Feb. 18,
                        1851, died Oct. 6, 1944, aged 93 years, seven months and 24 days. He was married to Sarah
                        Sturgill in 1874. To this union were born five children; three preceded him in death, which left
                        Bro. Sam and Lonzo to mourn their loss. He joined the United Baptist Church and was baptized by
                        Bro. Sam, his son, when he was 75 years old, on the second Saturday in July, 1925. He lived
                        faithful and always filled his seat at church and went to church when he had to be hauled in a
                        sled. We miss him at the old church and his home. He was loved by his many friends and
                        relatives. He believed in the doctrine of salvation by grace. We trust that his grandchildren
                        will strive to meet him in the city of the blessed. </p>

                    <p>With a sad and lonesome heart I try to write a sketch of the life of my dear husband, Tom
                        Burchfield. He was a dear husband and was loved by :all who knew him. He was long a devout
                        church member, His membership was with the Prestonsburg Church of United Baptists. He is greatly
                        missed by us all, but not forgotten.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>With sad hearts we try to write the life of dear mother Rhoda Skeans. She was born Feb. 15, 1870,
                        deceased April 24, 1945, aged 75 years, two months and eight days. She joined the United Baptist
                        Church several years ago and lived a devoted Christian life. Her husband, George Skeans, and
                        son, Bill Skeans, preceded her in death several years ago. But mother always told us children
                        she was going to live with father and son and all the children of God where there would be no
                        more separation. Mother last attended her church at West Prestonsburg on the 4th Saturday and
                        Sunday in March, 1945. Her rejoicing these two days that close to death will never be forgotten
                        by her brothers and sisters. Children: Taylor Skeans, Jonathan Skeans, Mrs. Julia Potter, Mrs.
                        Mary Ousley, Mrs. Eliza Blackburn, Mrs. Minerva Reffett, Mrs. Lizzie Wright, Mrs. Aggie Hayes,
                        all living. Now dear brothers and sisters, let's live here on earth so when this life is over we
                        can meet father, mother and brothers in the great beyond.</p>
                    <p>THE FAMILY</p>
                    <p>SISTER WILLIE ALLEN</p>
                    <p>With sadness of heart I write a sketch of our dear sister, Willie Allen, in Christ, who departed
                        this life May 31, 1945. She was 81 years old. In her last days she would say, "Tell my children
                        to live right, then they can die right so they can meet mother and that I am going home to die
                        no more." And that is what she would say over and over. Oh, Lord, look down from heaven with
                        view, See what a good mother has gone through. She has paid the debt we all have to pay, And now
                        she lies beneath the clay. Her favorite song was, "0, Sing to Me of Heaven." Her loss was
                        heaven's gain. Let us hope to meet her again.</p>

                        to meet father again some day. A true and loving father from us is gone, but we love him still,
                        and never to be forgotten while here on earth we live. </p>
                    <p>(Son) OSCAR</p>
                    <p>THOMAS B. SCALF</p>
                    <p>It is with a sad heart that I try to write the obituary of one that was so dear, to-wit: my
                        husband, Thomas B. Scalf, who was born March 10, 1894, and died Oct. 2, 1944; was married Dec.
                        25, 1917 and to this union was born one daughter, Evelyn, and on Nov. 22, 1919 he was injured in
                        the mines which left him a cripple for the rest of his life which was 25 years and 10 days. On
                        Easter Sunday 1920 he was carried to the water in a sheet and was buried in baptism in which he
                        had lived a faithful Christian life until God saw fit to call his dear, broken body home where
                        he will never suffer any more, which I had to see him do so much. He has gone to that mansion he
                        has read and talked to me so much about. He is not only missed at home but I believe all his
                        brothers and sisters in the church miss him. He was a deacon and clerk of New Life Church where
                        he was a member, also the treasurer. So many times when he would not be able to go to the
                        churchhouse his good brothers would come to our little home and have the meeting. He always
                        loved to feed the church people. He would always say, "Lilly, fix the best we have got, that's
                        all we have got to live for." He would say, "We have not got much of this world's goods, but I
                        do know we have got friends, and for that I am thankful." He is not dead but only sleeping,
                        waiting for the sweet resurrection when he will come forth with a perfect body likened to
                        Christ's own body, then he won't need a wheel-chair or have to be cared for like a baby. He told
                        me before he died that he would not get well. He said, "Looks like I have been at death's door
                        so many times but God has been good to me and let me stay all these many years, but this time I
                        will have to go," and he told me who he wanted to preach his funeral and said, "When I am gone I
                        want you to go to all the good meetings, you have missed so much on my account and I want to say
                        to Evelyn and George, if you ever see your daddy again you will have to be born again and follow
                        in his footsteps." I have heard him pray so much for you both. As I sit on my porch I can see
                        the little mound where he is sleeping, waiting, the redemption of his body that won't be a
                        cripple, as I have heard him sing, He will heal the crippled and give sight to the blind and
                        teach our children how to walk. He will raise up the dead that is sleeping underground and send
                        them home to God.</p>

                    <p>ELDER S. G. RICE (Samuel George Rice)</p>
                    <p>It is with much sadness that we try to write the obituary of our dear Elder and brother in the
                        Lord, S. G. Rice. He was born April 24, 1878, died March 19, 1945, aged 66 years, 10 months, 29
                        days. Was married to Sallie Sturgill, and to them were born eight children; four preceded him in
                        death and those living are Elmer, Lucerine, Ola and Olgie. After the death of his first wife he
                        was married to Cretie Boyd and to them were born six children: Shirley and Willie, Annie, Madge
                        and Georgia and Sina. Annie preceded him to death. All three boys are in the service of their
                        country. Brother Sam joined the United Baptist Church April the second Saturday, 1913 and was
                        ordained to preach October second Saturday, 1916. He was always faithful to the charge. He went
                        night and day when called on. He had the care of three churches when he had to leave us. The
                        time I talked with him he said he didn't fear to go if he could just see his boys again. But it
                        couldn't be-he had to go Brother Sam and I</p>
                    <p>preached together and always got along like brethren should. He was one of our best preachers and
                        was loved by all his brothers and sisters. We miss him at his home and at church. We know that
                        his dear wife and children miss him. He had the pleasure of seeing Olvie come to the old church.
                        We know she will meet him, and to the rest of his children, if you see your father again you
                        will have to take your father's advice. You don't know how many times I have heard Brother Sam
                        pray for you. Brother Sam isn't dead but just sleeping till God will wake the dead. I don't have
                        any doubts about him because he bore the fruits and the Bible says by their fruits you shall
                        know them. Sister Cretie and children, don't weep. When this short life is over we shall meet
                        Brother Sam again. It is with much grief that we write this.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>It is with a sad and broken heart I try to write a short sketch of a loving mother, Mahaley
                        Jones. She was born Jan. 19, 1873, deceased -Dec. 30, 1944. She was married to John H. Jones in
                        1889 and to this union were born nine children, five girls and four boys. One preceded her in
                        death. Father departed this life in 1931. Mother joined the Regular Baptist Church in 1901. She
                        was a faithful member and was loved by all who knew her. In 1904 she was taken into the United
                        Baptist Church on recommendation on account of bemg more convenient for her to attend church.
                        She said she could see no difference in their doctrine. Mother always liked to attend church.
                        Mother being afflicted for several years before she died she didn't attend church as often as
                        she wished. She moved to Ohio in 1925. She still held her fellowship at Clear Creek Church, Fed,
                        Ky. I am afflicted and could not be with mother during her last days on earth. When she passed
                        away they brought her to my house and kept her with me three nights. Her funeral was preached
                        here at my house by Charley Holbrook and Torn Smith. Oh, how I miss mother coming to see me. She
                        always looked back at me as she went out the door. She always told us children not to grieve
                        after her. All she hated to die for, she hated to leave her children. I feel she is resting in
                        heaven where there is no pain nor sorrow. I am trusting in God I will meet her in heaven. She
                        would always counsel us children to do the right thing. There are many good things I could say
                        about mother. As this obituary is getting too long I will close.</p>

                    <p>WILL CONN</p>
                    <p>By request I will attempt to write a short sketch of the life of my dear, loving brother, Will
                        Conn, who has gone to live with Jesus. He told me there was nothing in his way. He was born
                        March 19, 1869 and departed this life Oct. 21, 1944. He was 75 years, seven months and two days
                        old. He was a son of Sill Conn and Charity Conn and was married to Martha Taylor Nov. 28, 1894.
                        To this union were born seven children, six boys and one daughter. One preceded him in infancy,
                        leaving his good companion six children, three brothers and one sister and a host of
                        grandchildren and friends to mourn his loss. Bro. Will joined :the old United Baptist Church
                        about the year 1914 and always filled his seat until physically unable. For several years he was
                        unable to attend his meetings, at last the dreadful disease seized him so severe. His loved ones
                        gathered around his bed to minister to his needs, His dear old heart-broken companion, who stood
                        over him day and night, was ready every call to soothe his pain. Oh, how sad when I saw her lay
                        her hand upon his dying brow and said, I have done all I can. I knew he must soon answer the
                        great summons from on high, where the bright, dazzling light will never fade away that I saw
                        shining on the foot of his bed in his departing moments. He is missed by all his friends and
                        neighbors, he was always so kind to everybody, and always delighted to have someone come to his
                        home and talk to him on the Bible and about his home over yonder. He never let any one leave his
                        home hungry near meal time. Brother was very patient during his suffering and called for his
                        preaching brethren to come to his home and have meeting for him a 'short time before he passed
                        away. Oh, the old home is so lonesome to me when I go there and his dear old companion is so
                        lonesome. I often see the tears trickling down her face and I heard her say she wished her
                        departure of this life would come soon. I feel in the sweet by and by I will see Brother Will
                        again in a land of everlasting joy, where brother will not be worrying about his dear boy in the
                        army. He watched the door so patiently for him to come just before he passed away. Children, I
                        will now say to you, he is watching a greater door now for you to come, and if you ever see
                        father again you must be born again, not of a corruptible seed but incorruptible. I believe
                        brother is resting in the paradise of God with his father and mother and the rest of the family,
                        awaiting the great trumpet to sound that awakes the sleeping dust, when Jesus comes in the cloud
                        of glory to gather His elect home. Oh, what a happy meeting there will be when we take our
                        flight on wings of love to meet Jesus in the air when the song starts that never ends, and to
                        hear the voice of Jesus, "Fly open wide we everlasting gates and let my bride come in." I will
                        say again to the children, if you want to be one in that number and expect to see father again,
                        you must fall out with sin and join with the free of fered mercies of God before it is finally
                        and. everlastingly too late.</p>
