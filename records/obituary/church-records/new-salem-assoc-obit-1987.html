					<p><strong>JAMES THOMAS TERRY [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with a sad and aching heart and a
						lonely feeling, but with a thankful heart, as requested, to write an obituary of our precious
						and loving son, James Thomas Terry of Lackey, Kentucky. He was born May 5, 1938 and deceased
						this life April 24, 1983, making his stay here forty-five years and nine months. He is survived
						by his parents Ernest Terry and Lanie Jones Terry of Lackey, Kentucky, one sister, Bonnie
						Warrens, one brother-in-law, Glennis Warrens, a niece, Aleshia Hale, and one nephew, Jason
						Warrens, all of Garrett, Kentucky, and many, many relatives and friends too numerous to mention
						whom he loved and miss him so much. He was a friendly boy and loved his friends. The flower of
						their home is missing but will bloom in Heaven forever and ever where he won't have pain with
						that dreadful disease, cancer. He grew into manhood, but had the mind of a little child, loved
						little children and would tease them to see them laugh. My boy, as his mother would say, became
						very sick and wanted something done, they took him to Lexington Hospital, where doctors did all
						they could for him. His mother stood by his bed seeing him leave this sinful world, going to a
						better home we do believe, not made by hand. He told his dad on the phone, "I love you, Daddy."
						These were the last words he ever spoke. The death angel came and took him where there won't be
						any more sickness or death and by the help of the good Lord, you both can meet him again. You
						both did all you could, but parting came; home won't be the same but life has to go on. He
						wanted to be buried in his overalls and long sleeve shirt, as he always wore and wanted Old
						Regular Baptist preachers to sing and preach over him. They did as he requested so to both of
						you, press on and be ready when God calls, "Come on home," as I feel and believe little Jimmie
						was ready and answered the call, come on home and live with Jesus forever and ever. Written by
						Nora Slone Requested by Lanie and Ernest Terry</p>

					<p><strong>MABEL ELIZABETH HALL ENGLAND [Photo Not Available]</strong> With a broken heart I will
						try to write the obituary of our beautiful, beloved wife and mother, Mabel Elizabeth Hall
						England. Mother was born July 16, 1922 at Craynor, Kentucky, a daughter of Albert Leonard and
						Victora Tackett Hall, who preceded her in death. Mother was one of eleven children, four of whom
						preceded her in death. They were: William Freeman Hall, Ivan Eugene Hall, Elmer Ray Hall, and
						Virginia Mae Camp. She was married to Robert V. England on April 28, 1945 at the home of her
						parents in Wheelwright, Ky. They were married for forty-one years and nine months until death
						parted them. Unto this union were born three children: Robert Eric England of Price, Kentucky,
						Danny Lynn England of Palm City, Florida, and Brenda England Youmans of Minnie, Kentucky. She
						left behind to mourn their loss, her husband, her three children, four brothers: Albert L. Hall
						of River Rouge, Michigan, Clifford C. Hall of Polk City, Florida, Edwin Harry Hall of Edgewater,
						Florida; two sisters: Violet Ann Twaddle of Toledo, Ohio, Dallas Lou Prater of Edgewater,
						Florida; four grandchildren: Brett Traver, and Jordan Youmans, both of Minnie, Kentucky, Tai
						Myriah England of Price, Kentucky, Miranda England of Martin, two stepchildren: Michelle- and
						Marlene See of Palm City, Florida, and a host of other relatives and friends. Mother always had
						a smile on her face and a kind word to speak. She was always ready to give a word of
						encouragement, a big hug and words of love and understanding in our time of need. No problem was
						too small for us to bring to her. She would listen with patience and give us words of advice.
						She was always there for us, no matter how tired or how bad she would feel, we, her family,
						always came first. She was my best girl friend. Her door was always open and everyone was made
						to feel at home and feel like family. She was dearly loved by all her family and friends and our
						world will never be the same without her. Mother would have me tell you how much she appreciated
						all the kindnesses shown to her and her family during this trying time. It makes me proud to
						know how much people thought of my mother. Mother was a beautiful person both in person and in
						spirit and a bright and shining light has gone out of our lives. God picked a beautiful rose for
						his garden when he called Mother home to be with Him and I know she watches over us. She will
						live in our hearts forever more. Written by her loving daughter, Brenda England Youmans </p>

					<p><strong>WILEY JONES [Photo Not Available]</strong> I will now comply with the request of Lanie
						Jones Terry to write the obituary of a precious father, Wiley Jones. He was the son of the late
						Floyd and Sarah Bailey Jones of Magoffin County, Kentucky and was born May 4, 1888 He died
						September 4, 1983 making his stay on earth ninety-five years and nine months. He was married to
						Ellen Slusher. To this union were born ten children. His wife, Ellen, and eight children
						preceded him in death. One son, Frankie Jones of Tenneessee and one daughter, Lanie Jones Terry
						of Lackey, Kentucky, survive. Later he married Minnie Gibson, who also preceded him in death.
						After her death he married Susie Johnson, who also preceded him in death. One son, Jackie Jones
						was born to this union. Also surviving are eighteen grandchildren, forty-two
						great-grandchildren, and three great-great-grandchildren, who loved their papa. Wiley was a
						retired miner and a member of the Baptist Church. He worked hard to raise his family, was honest
						and a good citizen of the community. He was loved by all his family and many friends. In his
						last days he lived with his daughter and son-in-law, and when he became sick and needed care
						they took care of him as long as he lived. He bore his sickness with patience. We hope and
						believe he is resting from his labor. So sleep on, Daddy. I hope to meet you and I feel it won't
						be long until we will be together in that beautiful home not made by hand, eternal home where
						there will be joy, peace and happiness forever and ever and parting will be no more. Written by
						Nora Slone Requested by his daughter, Lanie Jones Terry</p>

					<p><strong>CHARLIE JOHNSON [Photo Not Available]</strong> As I sit here by my window, listening to
						the singing of the birds, the falling rain brings a sweet smell of freshness to the air. I'm
						reminded that all things were created by God for the good of his people, but because of the
						fallen nature, death was introduced to mankind. Death is what has brought me here to this place
						in my life. On a day not long ago, it seemed the music of the birds wasn't so sweet anymore, and
						the soft falling rain was the earth weeping for the passing of a good man. That man was my
						father, Charlie Johnson. Charlie Johnson was born to Malion and Ussla Johnson on April 13, 1913,
						the youngest of seven children. All of his life was spent in the mountains of Southeastern
						Kentucky where he learned to love the mountains and mountain people. He developed a great love
						for the creation of God. He appreciated the handiwork of God so much ...he always took the time
						to notice the beautiful blooming flowers in the spring over the rain...a cool breeze over the
						heat of the day... the yellow and red beauty of the changing leaves in the fall over the
						foretelling of the approaching winter... the purity of the snow over the inconvenience that it
						created. I guess that is the inheritance my Dad left me that I appreciate most ...a love for my
						Lord and his creation. To the life of Charlie Johnson, the Lord gave Eliza Jane Collins to be
						his wife on September 30, 1933. To this union were born seven children: Betty Sue Tackett of
						Marshallville, Ohio, Mary Lou Howell of Rittman, Ohio, Bonnie Jean Thacker of Rittmen, Ohio,
						Jeanetta Selbee of Ritman, Ohio, Charles Everette Johnson of Weeksbury, Kentucky, Nancy Louise
						McDonald of Rittman, Ohio, Billy Dean Johnson of Weeksbury, Kentucky. Proverbs 31:10 says, "Who
						can find a virtuous woman; for her price is far above rubies." My Dad did., When the world
						outside seemed like it was falling apart, there was always a sense of security around us,
						because we knew Mom and Dad had a never-dying love for each other. They loved us in the same
						manner. I remember Mom accepted the Lord into her life first. Dad would take her to church, but
						he would always stand way off in the back alone (Dad was always a quiet, shy man) and he would
						listen to the word of God. There soon began a war inside his heart, as he wrestled with his sin
						nature. Dad was a man most miserable, but he soon gave way to the wooing of the Holy Spirit. Dad
						gave his heart and life to the Lord. Dad soon joined the membership of the Old Regular Baptist.
						His home church was loppa, and he was a member there for thirty-seven years. Dad's church held a
						dear and sweet place in his heart. I remember in the summer we would attend services outside.
						Dad and I would take a walk up the hill and rest under a tree, but always within hearing of the
						Word. We would talk about how man was of a few days and full of trouble, but he would say it
						will be better over there, when we get home. That frightened me as a young girl because I didn't
						want to leave this great, loving man. My father was always so strong., but yet soft as a kitten
						when it came to his family. You know, I could write a book about this man named Charlie Johnson,
						but I realize space is limited. Dad went to be with his Lord December 17, 1986. I guess people
						would say he died, but Dad just cast aside that which is mortal and put on the robe of
						immortality. In my mind's eye I see the beautiful robed angel entering the hospital at
						Paintsville, Kentucky, saying, "Charlie, it's time for you to enter and claim your inheritance
						that is yours through the shed blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son." As Dad's spirit began to rise,
						I'm sure he looked back. The love of his wife and children were ever so strong on his heart, but
						as the beautiful music of Heaven caught his. ears, he look homeward and saw the faces of his Mom
						and Dad, his three children that died at birth, that he never had the joy of raising, and he
						gave one more glance back at his loved ones he was leaving. Suddenly, his eye caught a glimpse
						of the resurrected Christ and His glory, and my Dad was earthbound no more, he wanted to be with
						his Lord. We were told that he got this beautiful smile on his face, and he just stopped
						breathing. I believe that was when he saw Jesus. It was at that moment Dad's presence was taken
						from us, but not his love and the things he taught us. They will live on in our hearts and life
						as long as the Lord blesses us to live. Dad never acquired much earthly wealth, but he was an
						heir of a kingdom. He never acquired any earthly degrees, but he was a man of great wisdom. He
						always taught his family about the Lord, and he lived what he taught. In closing I say,"...and,
						I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me, write: blessed are the dead which die in the Lord
						from henceforth: Yea saith the spirit; that they may rest from their labors, and their works do
						follow them." Revelation 14:13. My daddy, Charlie Johnson, is resting. Written by the family</p>

					<p><strong>BUTLER HAMILTON[Photo Not Available]</strong> With a sad heart, I am writing this
						obituary of Butler Hamilton, my brotherin-law. He was born on April 3, 1932 and passed away June
						5, 1985 of a heart attack in his home, making his stay here on earth fifty-three years. He was
						married to Dorothy Faye Hamilton on June 9, 1951 and to this union were horn two daughters,
						Tricia Ann and Shireen, who both preceded him in death. Butler was the son of E. V. Hamilton and
						Della Hamilton. He is survived by four brothers: Bill Hamilton of McDowell, Ky., Ruford Hamilton
						of St. Louis, Mo., John L. Hamilton of Baltimore, Md., Carl D. Hamilton of Jefferson City,
						Tenn., and two sisters: Lillie Hammonds of Martin, Ky., and Marie Clark of Pikeville, Ky. Butler
						was a good-hearted person and did many favors for people who came to Michigan looking for work.
						Butler had several illnesses during his lifetime. During the last several years of his life he
						prayed and read the Bible daily. He had a hope of a better place where there would be no more
						pain and sorrow after he left this earth. I am sure Butler, Dorothy and their two children are
						all in Heaven. By Magdalene DeVillez</p>

					<p><strong>DOROTHY HAMILTON [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with a sad heart that I write this
						obituary of my beloved sister, Dorothy Faye Hamilton. She was born October 25, 1930 and left
						this life January 15, 1987 making her stay here on earth fifty-six years. She passed away at the
						Harper Hospital, Detroit, Michigan following a long illness. She was married to Butler Hamilton,
						who preceded her in death. Unto them were born two daughters: Tricia Ann and Shireen, who both
						passed away during their early childhoods. She is survived by her mother, Goldie Hamilton of
						Teaberry, and four sisters: Magadalene DeVillez, with whom she made her home for the last twenty
						months in Riverview, Michigan, Shirley Reynolds of Beaver, Kentucky, Vicky Bryant of Beaver,
						Kentucky, Lakie Johnson of Teaberry, Kentucky; five brothers: Jay Lee Hamilton and Lee Roy
						Hamilton, both of Beaver, Kentucky, Eugene Hamilton and Ralph Hamilton, both of Teaberry,
						Kentucky , a::u Garry Donald Hamilton of Taylor, Michigan. Dorothy was a great person, everyone
						that knew her loved her. All the children in the family loved her like a grandmother. She never
						complained about her illness or anything. She would always tell me she was going to be alright.
						She had enough faith in the Lord. I know she has gone to a better resting place than was on
						earth for her. There is never a day that my heart doesn't ache for her. We all miss her so much.
						Her suffering is over but we miss her because she was such a pleasure to have around. I would
						like to share with you some kind words that were written about my beloved sister by Cory Adkins:
						Sister Dorothy was a member of the Little Ida Church. We are so thankful that our paths did
						cross in this life. We all have been so blessed to know sweet Dorothy. Sister Dorothy lived a
						humble life living peacefully among all who knew her. Her very life was always with Christ in
						everything she said and did. 1 was priviliged to have many good talks with her. Sister Dorothy
						inspired everyone who came in contact with her, never complaining and always trusting God that
						she would overcome her sickness. Sister Dorothy had cancer of the throat, suffered through many
						treatments and was in and out of the hospital very often. When Brother John Ankins and I would
						go visit her, she was always so happy for visitors to come and see her. Sister Dorothy had a
						love so strong that she lifted all our spirits. She would often say "Sister Cory, I am going to
						lick this thing yet." She never gave up hope and never seemed discouraged. She remained faithful
						to the end, her hopes never seemed to grow dim. Oh yes, Sister Dorothy, you finally overcame
						every pain, every heartache, and went on home to rest in Jesus who will give you a perfect body.
						Debbie DeVillez, neice, and Sister Dorothy were so close. They always read the Bible and prayed
						together. Debbie loved her so much. Those that do not know God and want to go to the great
						reunion in Heaven to be with Sister Dorothy, You must all repent of your sins and live for God
						if you expect to see her again. For those who are in Christ, death is not the end but only the
						beginning when we come to know God's life has just begun. Sister Dorothy, we long for the day
						when we can see the cancer all gone and be reunited with you around the throne of God. By
						Magdalene DeVillez</p>

					<p><strong>THELMA HALE OUSLEY [Photo Not Available]</strong> With much sadness, I'll try to write an
						obituary of my mother, Thelma Ousley. Thelma Hale Ousley was born October 14, 1912 at
						Alphoretta, Kentucky to James and Sarah Prater Hale. She departed this life April 25, 1987,
						making her stay seventy-four years and six months. She married Dockie Ousley March 29, 1929 at
						Risner, Kentucky. Dad died September 4, 1956 of a stroke and heart attack. To this union were
						born ten children: Burnis (Bud), Willie (Bee), and Gomer, all deceased, Gean Carr, of
						Cincinnati, Ohio, Paul Ousley of Morehead, Kentucky, Edd Ousley of Prestonsburg, Kentucky, Lilly
						Deturk of Peru, Indiana, Cassie Shepherd of Langley, Kentucky, Curtis Ousley of Tucson, Arizona,
						Ruth Harmon of Warsau, Indiana. She leaves twenty-one grandchildren and fourteen great
						grandchildren to mourn her loss. Mom became a christian in 1974. She was baptized into the Old
						Regular Baptist Church of Cold Springs. She always attended church when she was able. She had a
						dear friend, Julie Ousley who always took her to church. They always called each other to see if
						each was able to go to church. Mom's sickness was diagnosed seven weeks before God called her
						home. She never complained during her sickness. Mom said the sickness she had, it took the good
						Lord above to bring her through, but God saw he needed another rose for his garden. Mom worked
						hard to raise her children after Dad died. She prayed hard for them. She was one of the greatest
						mothers in the world. I believe Mom is at rest from her labor. She is greatly missed as each day
						passes by. Mom had four sisters and three brothers: Pearlie (deceased), Okra (deceased),
						Virginia Adkins of Lima, Ohio, Clyde Hale of Martin, Kentucky, and Lawrence Hale of
						Prestonsburg, Kentucky. If Mom could speak back, I believe she would say, "I'm not in any pain,
						I'm at rest. My children did a great job taking care of me." Her family kept her home and stayed
						day and night and took care of her. Written by a broken-hearted daughter Cassie Shepherd of
						Langley,, Kentucky</p>

					<p><strong>JUNIE BOYD [Photo Not Available]</strong> In loving memory of our dearest mother, Junie
						Conn Boyd, who departed this sorrowful world for her heavenly home on April 3, 1987. Mother was
						born September 3, 1917 to Hie and Virgie Conn. She grew up in a happy home with six sisters:
						Nicie, Norma, Allie, Atchie, Frankie and three brothers: Willie, Edd, and Banner. One sister,
						Atchie, and both parents preceded Mother in death. Mother chose Liney Boyd to be her loving
						husband, May 2, 1935 and started a wonderful family foundation. Their building stones were:
						Yvone, Virgie Rose, Christopher, Coley Douglas, and Faye. Christopher died at birth. Our home
						holds many precious memories. Mother gave her loving care to each and every one she touched. She
						was thought of by her younger brothers and sister as Mother, and by her nieces and nephews as
						Granny. Mother joined the Old Regular Baptist Church the third Sunday in September, 1950 making
						her home at the Little Salem Church. The greatest part of her life was being with her brethren
						and sisters and rejoicing in the Lord. Mother was a faithful member of the church and an
						inspiration to all who knew her. We have often heard her spoken as a Mother and a great light of
						the church. One by one the children left the family home making a family of their own. Yvone
						chose Willie Howell, Virgie Rose chose Bill Jack Scalf, Faye chose Kermit Hall, and Doug chose
						Melisa Meade. Mother was blessed with seven grandsons; Harold, Rickie, David, Stevie, Tommy,
						Michael, and Douglas Lee; two granddaughters- Robin and Patty. Her rose garden was complete with
						her seven great-grandchildren. The dreadful disease of cancer made Mother unable to go and be
						with friends and neighbors for the past five years. It gives us joy that we were blessed to keep
						her home and care for her until Jesus called for her to be with him in heaven. Written by her
						loving family with the help of Clinton Akers</p>

					<p><strong>GEORGE R. KIDD [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with much sadness and a broken heart
						that I try, with the help of the good Lord, to write the obituary of our dear father, George R.
						Kidd. He was born June 1, 1924 at Honaker, Kentucky, the son of Mack and Vesta Hughes Kidd. He
						died November 13, 1986 making his stay on earth sixty-two years, five months and twelve days. He
						married Della Carroll, July 15, 1940. . Unto this union were born sixteen children. Four
						children preceded him in death. Left to mourn their loss are:: his wife, Della, twelve children,
						four brothers, six sisters, forty-seven grandchildren, and thirteen great-grandchildren. His
						children are: Mack Denzil Kidd of Honaker, Ky., F. B. Kidd of Louisa, Ky., Elder Maniford
						"Freddie" Kidd of Grethel, Ky., Tennie Kidd Parsons, Julavene Kidd Case and JoAnn Kidd Innis,
						all of Honaker, Ky., George Ann Kidd Case, Pikeville, Ky., R. J. Kidd of Boldman, Ky. Simon Kidd
						of Betsy Layne, Ky., Russell Kidd of Honaker, Ky., Alvagail Kidd Bryant of Virgie, Ky. , Ima Sue
						Kidd Collins of Honaker, Ky., and an unofficially adopted daughter, Alvanell Case Rose of
						Honaker, Ky. His brothers and sisters are: brother and Brother in Hope, Mack Kidd, Jr. of
						Prestonsburg, Ky., Otis Kidd of West Liberty, Ky., John Kidd of Michigan, and Audis Kidd, Vanie
						Mae, Goldie Williams, and Nancy Kidd of New London, Ohio, Pricie Case of Michigan, Cindy
						Williams of Harold, Ky., Lillie Dean Rudd of Norwalk, Ohio. We all surely feel our loss is that
						blessed eternal Heaven's gain. Daddy joined the Old Regular Baptist Church August 25, 1950 and
						had his membership with the Cold Springs Church when he died. He was retired disabled from the
						Columbia Gas Company. Now I want to take this opportunity to say 1. being the next to oldest
						child, so well remember that Mother, all the days of my daddy's adult life, took care of and
						looked out for him. 1 remember as far back as there was just three of us children and Mother
						would say "We have to get Daddy some supper ready and fix him something good to eat for he can't
						work unless he has something good to eat." I heard that many times. I know for sure that mother
						loves her children, and I also know that the bond she felt for Daddy, between her and him,
						doesn't get any stronger between men and women. I had known for over three months before Daddy
						went into the hospital the last time that it was right down to the very end of his days. I had a
						dream about that time, in the dream Daddy was dead and Mother was so troubled about it, in the
						dream there was such a void and as I looked, Daddy started to raise up out of the coffin. Then
						he told me to go over there and tell Mother she will worry herself into a heart attack. He said,
						"And I am not dead yet. This is just to show you all what will happen shortly." When 1 awoke the
						void was still there and all day the void wouldn't leave. I told my wife I didn't think Dad
						would live until Christmas. We buried Daddy the 16th of November. After that dream, I would sit
						in the Cold Spring Church and watch Dad and could see his health failing more and more. The last
						New Salem Association (1986) once there he came outside. My son, Darrell, saw him just leaning
						on his cane and looking to the top of a nearby mountain. He just turned around as if nothing was
						wrong and had tears in his eyes. I think that was the last time he was ever at church on Earth.
						I want to say this is the first time I have written an obiturary and I don't know if I am
						writing it the wrong way or not but, above everything, I don't want to hurt anyone, since I have
						been asked to write. I must write what's on my mind. I want to say, especially to his children,
						there certainly are differences in dreams. I feel for sure I have been with our dad three times
						since he left. I surely had been asking to be allowed to see him. 1 went to church in the dream,
						the house set upon a hill. Where I went in and looked around I noticed everyone was someone that
						had died in the last few years. I said, "Something is wrong. I know all these people are dead."
						Just then I looked over beside the stand and there was Daddy. He came over to me. I noticed he
						wasn't half as old looking. He looked like a very young man. His face and the others there were
						shining like a light. I do feel I was with him. For the next few days my worried and troubled
						mind wasn't near as bad at it had been yet a little while longer. I got wanting to see him. I
						can only describe as real bad again. I prayed the best I know how. This time he came to me so
						clear it woke me. I feel before he finished talking, he came that time in a light-colored pickup
						truck and drove me through about four hundred foot of water. He stopped up on a hill and let me
						out. As I got out a book about the size of a large photo album slid down. He reached down to get
						it as if to get it before I did. That is when I first noticed to take a good look at him. I did
						notice he was younger than I was this time. I commented on his young looks, and as before, his
						face shining, he just smiled. Then I looked again at the book he had. I noticed it had three
						strings like binders. One near the bottom and top and one in the middle. I asked what it was. He
						started to untie the strings. I looked and saw some people coming down the road. He just stopped
						untying the binders and said, "You see up there where we first came into the water?" I said I
						did. He said from there all the way down to us here, are people that are going to be the next to
						do what I had to do. I then looked at him again and said, "Dad, I just remembered you were
						dead." He again just smiled. He said that is what this book is, the names of people that 1 know,
						in my neighborhood that will be next. I said "Daddy, if I hear you right you said people from
						the water to here are the ones whose names were in the book that was next." He said, "Yes." I
						said, "I was just going to work and thought you were going to give me a lift. He said, "No, I
						just came to help get you through the water, from here on you are on your own." I don't mean to
						make a long writing of this but, 1 feel, for some reason I must tell these things that have
						happened. I prayed a third time. This time he came again in a dream but didn't speak to me. Just
						smiled at me. My very best guess is he looked like a man about twenty-five years old and his
						face was Wowing like a light. Now at least two months more passed, and I admit this is strange,
						knowing the Bible says from dust to dust we shall return and also this body must put on
						incorruption, but I got to thinking and worrying because it has been enough time for my daddy to
						be about returned to the dust. This was hard for me. Remembering him walking around, this was so
						hard to bear. 1 found myself worrying night and day and one day I had worried all morning. I
						started through the house and here came words, like words stamped on a stencil, "stop worrying."
						This is something everyone has to do and your daddy was glad and willing and wanted to have his
						body decay away so he could fulfill what was commanded and enter eternal life. Now since that
						day I can't worry about this every time it comes into my mind. 1 am reminded of the words that
						just seem to be planted in my mind and the worry leaves almost instantly. Now children, Dad left
						a great witness. While he was in the hospital he told of many good things some of you may not
						know. He told of my son, Darrell, going to join the church and would be a preacher. He said the
						only thing he dreaded about ding was just getting down to the river. You know the body fights to
						live and great pain comes on getting down to death. The Bible says death is a stranger. I want
						to say to his children and to his brothers and sisters in the flesh, I don't mean any hurt to
						you at all, but I feel if I didn't say what's on my mind it wouldn't be pleasing to God and it
						might harm me and the readers of this writing. You that don't know God in the pardon and
						remission of your sins, look around you. Most all of you have already spent the biggest part of
						your life on earth. You won't get to come back and live it again. This is a one-time road. Let
						me beg you, don t be misled. You are too smart for that. The Bible says to search and inquire of
						the old path and when you find it, don't ask a man or woman. Hide away in a secret place where
						you can pray to God with the most sincere heart and meaning as if your very life depended on it
						and don't ever forget ...it does. And when God hears you and he will lead you and I will say to
						you when you get to his house and look around his people will look different than the people in
						the world. You know if you miss heaven it will be your. fault. Ask yourselves, this place I've
						been going can I even with World History trace its beginning back past this country? You know
						the Bible says unless God builds the house the labor is in vain. Back over 1900 years ago Jesus
						laid the foundations and there cannot be any more started. When John was exiled he saw seven
						churches, now out of them, only one was doing what it should be. Now even so Jesus only said to
						it, "You've been faithful over a few things." The blessed part was he said "I will make you
						ruler over many." So now if you go to this place, as yourself, can I trace this place beginnings
						back to the first century? If not you know you have to be in the wrong place so don't settle for
						anything but the best. It will take you to the eternal and blessed heaven where Daddy is. Jesus
						is there. Always remember without sin in the world, Jesus would not have had to come and
						remember we all surely have our faults, and if we have been a bigger sinner, Jesus most surely
						is a bigger savior. You know Daddy there in the hospital, when he was jumping so hard and tore
						the bed up, that is when death first hit him. Some of you might not know this but when we called
						the preachers in I was standing just behind two of the preachers. I could hardly hear what they
						were saying but you know that Daddy, owing to pneumonia, could hardly get his breath. I saw with
						my own eyes his breathing get easier. When the preachers laid their hands back down, he could
						hardly get his breath again. They picked up his hands the second time and I watched his
						breathing ease off this time and stay eased. Surely, I saw God answer the Old Regular Baptist
						preachers prayer right before my eyes. The last two times Daddy spoke to me alive, his only
						words were "God Bless your heart "and "I love you, son." So after writing all of this I say
						again, no offense is intended. I stopped writing several times because it seemed like my mind is
						leading away from a regular obituary. I feel if God is leading my mind someone will read this
						that might think about it and I know if you think about it and do what I have told you to do it
						will do some good. God bless you. Written by a daughter-in-law and sister in hope, and son, F.

					<p><strong>ELDER PAUL E. ADKINS [Photo Not Available]</strong> As the darkness of another night gave
						away to the dawn of a new day, a pilgrim father and child of the Heavenly Kind gathered his robe
						around him and was carried by the angels to the land of rest. The land he had sung about, the
						land he had preached about, now the land he was going to see about. This our dear one to wit:
						Paul E. Adkins. A highly respected minister in the gospel of Christ, a faithful, devoted husband
						and father. A loving son, Brother and friend of many was gently led into a land where the
						pastures are always green and the air is pure and real. Elder Paul E. Adkins, son of the late
						Criss and Frankie Mullins Adkins, was born January 3 , 1936 in the lovely hills of eastern
						Kentucky. Here he grew up with three little brothers and eight little sisters in a community
						known as Greasy Creek, Pike County, Kentucky. When but a very young man, his widowed mother,
						Sister Frankie Adkins, came to this city to try and better their livelihood. Here God blessed
						this our precious Brother to live upon His good earth fifty years, six months and sixteen days.
						On the early morning of July 19, 1986, after many months of pain and suffering, God called him
						home, the home he begged God to come and take him to. Leaving behind a truly faithful, devoted
						and loving wife, Sister Dorcas Jean Carrol, the wife of his youth, who shared life's heartaches,
						troubles and disappointments along with its joys, happiness, and pleasures since January 27,
						1956 when they took their wedding vows and both lived true to these vows. God enriched their
						lives by blessing them with the following children: Paul Dean Adkins, and Darrell Wayne Adkins,
						both of Louisville, Ky., and Rhonda Jones and Danna Bohannon, both of Simpsonville, Ky. Left to
						mourn the loss of a dear son is his loving mother, Frankie Adkins, of Louisville, Ky. He was
						preceded in death by one sister, Ozell. He also leaves five grandchildren who gave him love by
						calling him "Papa." When but a very young lad of nineteen, Brother Paul saw himself lost and in
						the need of a Saviour. Repenting of his sins and going home to his friends, he became a faithful
						member of the Old Regular Baptist Church on February 24, 1957. He was ordained to the full
						function of the gospel in March, 1962. He was in the arm to organize the Antioch Church in July,
						1966. Here he was their faithful Assistant Moderator for eleven years and Moderator for nine
						years, always giving good advice and counsel. He believed in good order, a clean church and
						discipline of the Old Regular Baptist, Faith and Order. He wore one coat, preached one doctrine
						and he stood firm on the word of God. Never failing to proclaim His word, that men and women are
						different from the world after they are born again and by their lifestyles and the fruit they
						bear that they were the children of God. A Brother whose life was like a magnet drawing others
						to him, both young and old, by his kind words, humble life, quiet and meek spirit. One found it
						a pleasure and joy to be in the company of Brother Paul. He and I have traveled thousands of
						miles for the past twenty years trying to proclaim his word to comfort - those in need and to be
						a help to others. Brother Paul never complained of his cross, always letting his light shine to
						enlighten the pathway of those who sat in darkness. For the past five years, Brother Paul
						suffered with that dreadful disease, cancer. Never complaining, going many times when he wasn't
						able, to warn men and women of the danger of living and dying in sin and the joy and happiness
						of living for the Lord. A true and devoted wife, Sister Dorcas was to him, standing by his side
						preparing his meals, giving him courage, and trying to ease his suffering. Spending many days in
						the hospital, she was always there. Last week, he began to beg the Lord to come and take him
						home. He called his children to his bedside, giving them good advice and counsel. To you his
						loved ones who have no hope, please begin to repent and pattern your life afters this our good
						Brother. To you the Brothers and Sisters of this blessed old church, continue on in the good old
						way, never leaning to the left or right. Always remember the good counsel and advice he gave us.
						Strive for peace and never bring shame on the church. Always be an upbuild as Brother Paul was.
						He was not ashamed to be called an old-time Baptist. We will miss him in our journeying here.
						March on and some sweet day we will meet where parting never comes. Brother Paul's life was a
						light to his fellow workers at the Fisher Packing Company where he was supervisor. As long as we
						live, he will live and to know him was to love him. Brother Paul will be missed in our sister
						Associations and churches. Let us thank God for having the joy of walking with him here and the
						hope of meeting him again in the morning of the resurrection. Sleep on Brother Paul, take your
						rest and we that remain will always remember you as a valiant soldier, a man of honor, respect,
						but most of all, a humble servant. We love you today, we hope to meet you tomorrow. Your
						co-worker in Christ, Brother Newsome</p>

						1987, making her stay with her family sixty-seven years, six months and five days. Martha was
						born in Boyd County at Rush, Kentucky. She spent most of her young life in Boyd and Lawrence
						counties. She was always a shy, kind and loving daughter. She stayed at home and took care of
						her mother who was sick with that dreadful disease, cancer. After her mother died on September
						21, 1940, she was married to Ward Elder of Georgetown, Kentucky. They lived a very happy life
						until November 27, 1976, when he was called home after a long illness. After about two years or
						more she met and married Kell Combs. They loved each other dearly and has six years, two months
						and twenty-one days together until the death angel came and called her name. She went sweetly to
						sleep in the arms of Jesus. She was a lovely person. She lived a beautiful life, always helping
						others and trying to make life a little easier for everyone. Always doing little things to try
						and cheer someone on along the way even when she was sicker than they were. Sister Martha never
						had any children, but she had three step-daughters: Shirley Combs at home, Edith Mae Shick, and
						Judy Faye Hensley, six step-sons: Edwin Combs, French Combs, Walter Combs, Orville Ray Combs,
						and Robert Combs. Martha was sick for a long time before she died, but the last eleven weeks
						were spent in the Appalachian Regional Hospital at Hazard and in the nursing home at Hindman,
						Kentucky, She had cancer and after they operated, she was never any better. She stayed four
						weeks in the nursing home where everybody was so wonderful and took the very best care of her.
						We will always be thankful for that. Some of the family were with her all the time. Sister
						Martha made peace with her Lord. She told us she had been born again and was not afraid to die.
						Besides her husband, Kell, and step-children, she leaves to mourn their loss two sisters and two
						brothers: Elder Richard Church of Softshell, Kentucky, Bill Church of Wapakenita, Ohio, Opal
						Smith and Mabel Smith of Leburn, Kentucky. She also leaves eighteen nieces and nephews and a
						host of relatives and friends and Brothers and Sisters in the church. Sister Martha joined the
						New Home Old Regular Baptist Church at Leburn. Her name is on record there but thank God it was
						also written in the Lambs Book of Life. Brother Kell, we know it is a lonesome and lonely life
						for you. We all miss her but I am sure you miss her most. Family, let's do the very best we can
						and with God's help we will meet her again. All the Brothers and Sisters and Brother Kell have
						been born again and living in the good old Baptist way. Won't you come and go to heaven with us.

					<p><strong>DAYMON HYLTON [Photo Not Available]</strong> By the help of God I will try to write the

						that God was the only one that could help him in time of need. He was in the V. A. Hospital in
						Huntington, West Virginia. His hands were tied to the bed and he tried to free them so he could
						get some ease. A voice asked him what he was doing, he said, "Praying." The oice said, "Pray
						on." When he moved his hands again the straps just slipped off his hands. He knew then that God
						forgave him of his sins. He said he felt like a new man. He said the burden was just lifted
						away. He joined the Regular Baptist Church and was baptized on April of 1986 by Elder Eles Case
						and Elder Albert Damron. He was so humble and cried out for God to take him on out of his pain.
						He had that dreadful disease called cancer that took him so fast, so I feel that my loss is

					<p><strong>VICTORIA SLONE [Photo Not Available]</strong> Victoria Slone was born December 16, 1919
						and passed from this life September 25, 1986 at the age of sixty-six years. She was the daughter
						of (Preacher) Billy and Oma Slone. Early in life she was married to Emmitt Slone and they had
						four children; three sons and one daughter. One son, Bobby Darrell, and the daughter, Corrine,
						had already passed on. Her survivors include: her husband, Brother Emmitt, and two sons, Berlin
						Gene of Waterloo, Indiana and Jackie Dean of Pippa Passes, Ky. Also, one brother, Marion Slone,
						and one sister, Sarah Ann Slone. She had eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren,
						along with other relatives and many friends. Several years ago, Sister Victoria gave her hand to
						the church and told a wonderful experience of how she had been praying and she felt with all of
						her Heart that the God of Heaven had forgiven her sins. Since that time she has proven by her
						life that her faith was real. She kept the same faith through all the long months of her
						sickness, and I believe with all of my heart that it took her to heaven when she had to leave.
						She suffered much through the last two years and her family did everything they possibly could
						do for her, but when the suffering became too great, I believe that the big hand of God came
						down and took her to a place where cancer, heart attacks or anything else can never hurt-her
						again. Brother Emmit had a very close and loving family, and I am sure there will be many dark
						and lonely hours for them in the weeks and months ahead. Not many years ago they were father,
						mother and four children. Now two children and mother are gone, but they can be happy that each
						of them left a bright shining hope of a better life. Just think about what a great thing it
						would be if all of the family would meet again. Brother Emmitt and Sister Victoria have shown
						them the way, and the God of Heaven has said "Let whoever will come and take of the water of
						life." I pray the rest of the family will decide deep in their hearts to seek God and go and see
						Mother again.</p>

					<p><strong>HASCAL DAMRON &nbsp;[Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with much weakness and sadness

						river and entered into that beautiful place called paradise. Brother Hascal Damron was born
						March 7, 1915 and ceased this earthly life April 7, 1987 at the age of seventytwo years. He was
						born in Pike County and was the son of the late Bertram and Ella Tackett Damron. He was married
						to Mary Leah Mitchell December 1934 and to this union were born four children: two girls,
						Jeanette Bentley and Juanita Lewis of Little Creek, also two sons Bobby Joe and John (Bill)
						Damron, preceded him in death. September 26, 1981 became a very lonesome time for Brother
						Hascal, when his companion was called from this earthly shore, but we feel their souls are
						together once again around the throne of God. He also leaves to mourn his death: one brother,
						Gene Damron of Little Creek; two sisters, Joan Newsome of Little Creek, and Nella Mae Bartley of
						Collins, also eleven grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren. Brother Hascal joined the Old
						Regular Baptist Church and was baptized along with his companion July 14, 1981 and took their
						membership to the Elizabeth Church. He was afflicted for so many years and spent many lonely
						hours without his companion, but thank God for the children and everyone that lent a helping
						hand to comfort and care for him because the loving memories of the one you grow closer to as
						each day passes is something death did not take away because they are a gift of God that is his
						way of leaving you those thoughts and dreams to comfort you and to show you he loves you and
						will reward you for every good deed. When we would go to see Brother Hascal and have a little
						meeting, we wouldn't sit around too long until he would say , "Sing that song, The Great High
						Mountain." We feel that he reached the top of that great high mountain and his soul entered into
						a place of rest until that great morning when God will call for Brother Hascal's body and the
						soul will come back and reunite with that body and God will change his body to a spiritual body
						that won't be sick anymore and will join with all the heavenly host in a country where he'll
						walk down that golden street and sit down at a table and eat that wedding supper and give God
						the praise forever and forever. God bless you all and as you look down upon Brother Hascal's
						smiling face say in your hearts, by the grace of God, we'll meet you in Heaven someday. As I

					<p><strong>BEVERAGE MOORE [Photo Not Available]</strong> Beverage Moore was born March 10, 1904 and

						Sturneth Inmon, Sturnel Duff, Bennie, Budge, Tandy, Sellmeyer, Kenneth, Marvin, Rodney and

						daughter; one brother, Albert; four sisters: Sarah Turner, Maude Spencer, Mae Salisbury, and
						Quence Morris; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Now I will try to twll you about
						the father I have known and shall remember. There is so much that could be said and so little
						that needs to be. He was reared in the head of Turkey Creek when there were no roads and little
						need for any. He grew up farming the hillsides and bottoms of Turkey Creek and surrounding
						valleys. Later he worked as a teacher, teamster in the days of mules and Wagons, and coal miner.
						He would ride a horse or walk to surrounding valleys and to mining jobs, night or through rain
						or snow and was always there on time. I remember him riding a sled with his leg in a cast to the
						hip, down a hill so steep that the sled had to be roughlocked to get a doc. He made no pretty
						speeches and gave little advice that was not asked for, but we always knew that he believed in
						what he stood for. "Do your best, be honest and when you need to tell it, tell it like it is."
						No matter what he was doing or for whom, Dad was always a hard-working man that was honest and
						truthful in all of his ways: Dad would first have you remember the difference that Jesus made in
						his life. Dad and Mom joined the church October 26, 1969 and were baptized November 23, 1969. He
						wrote in his Bible about the day they were baptized, "What a happy day for us! I don't think I
						will see another like it while we live." Then Dad would have you remember the love he had for
						his family, his love for his brothers and sisters in the church and the love he had for his
						neighbors. I believe a prayer that would have described Dad's wishes here would have been: "O
						Lord, hear my plea before 1 leave. May I live so my friends will follow me. The little ones you
						gave to me while here below, 1 want to meet each one of them when I get home. " Dad said he
						wouldn't want to live in a home without little children and now he is in a place where there are
						lots of little ones. You couldn't write about Dad with adding something about the great love he
						had for Mom. This would leave an empty space as big as the one that was left in his life without
						her. Weep not for him that dieth For he hath ceased from tears, And a voice to his replieth
						Which he hath not heard in years.</p>

					<p><strong>ELDER MARTIN V. BURKE [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with a sad and aching heart
						that I attempt to write an obituary of a loving companion and bold soldier of the Cross. Elder
						Martin V. Burke was born May 2, 1893 and departed this life on January 9, 1987, making his
						earthly stay ninety-three years, eight months and one week. On July 17, 1913 he was united in
						marriage to Dollie Hall. Unto this union were born two sons and one daughter, to wit: Bennie F.
						Burke, born November 6, 1914, Liza Burke, born June 30, 1916, and Joseph P. Burke, born February
						4, 1918. Brother Mart was preceded in death by his daughter Liza in 1917 and his son, Befnie in
						1942. In January 1957 he lost his dear companion. After being alone for a while, he married
						Sister Luenda Little. Sister Luenda stood faithfully by his side for almost thirty years. He is
						survived by his loving wife, Luenda and ten grandchildren. Brother Mart's remaining son, Joe,
						passed from this earthly life one month after Brother Mart was laid to rest. Brother Mart joined
						the Old Union Regular Baptist Church July 10, 1915. He felt the call to the ministry and was
						libertized to exercise a public gift, the second Saturday in December 1915, and was ordained to
						the full functions of the gospel the fourth Saturday in March 1918. Brother Mart served many
						churches as moderator and assistant moderator. He traveled widely, sitting in presbyteries for
						the organization of churches and associations. The Lord blessed him with a rich understanding of
						the Scriptures and caused him to preach many inspiring sermons. When he was blessed to preach
						and expound to simple gospel truths it was like Solomon wrote "For lo, the winter is past, the
						rain is over and gone; The flowers appear on earth; The time of the singing of birds is come,
						and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land." He never regretted the many years he spent or
						the cause of Christ and found nowhere to turn back. I feel that if Brother Mart could speak back
						to his preaching brethren he would tell them as the Prophet Joel wrote, "Blow ye the trumpet in
						Zion and sound an alarm in my Holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the
						day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand." If he could speak back to his friends and
						neighbors who have not made peace with God, he would teil them to repent and be born again if
						they want to walk down the streets of gold and be with Jesus forever. Brother Mart is sadly
						missed by a lonely wife, a host of relatives, friends, and brothers and sisters in hope. Written
						at the request of his lonely wife, Luenda Burke By Elder Jeffrey Little Memorial will be
						preached at the Old Longfork Regular Baptist Church the fourth Saturday and Sunday in June,
						1988. All Old Regular Baptist Ministers are invited.</p>

						and the late Elizabeth Cole Newman. She died June 15, 1987 at the Highlands Regional Medical
						Center, Prestonsburg, Kentucky after suffering a heart attack. Her stay on earth was eighty-four
						years, nine months and four days. America lived in and around the Bevinsville area almost all of
						her life, except for the last fourteen years of which she made her home at Prestonsburg,
						Kentucky. She was born into a family of fourteen children, eight girls and six boys. America had
						seven sisters: Liza Jane, Lula, Malinda Gertrude, Adaline, Martha and Mary. She has six
						brothers: George, Tivis, Hatler, Gladis, Woodrow and Albert. All but Malinda, Adaline, Martha,
						Mary and George preceded her in death. In early life America married Gus Johnson, who preceded

						seventeen great-grandchildren, all of whom miss her so much. On February 12, 1987 God called our
						precious mother home from all suffering and pain, making her stay on earth seventy-four years,
						eight months and sixteen days. Mom never joined any church here but she faithfully attended the
						Old Regular Baptist Church for about thirty-seven years. She went every Saturday and Sunday
						while she was able to. Mom enjoyed cooking and seeing everyone from church come home and eat
						with them. The larger the crowd they had, the better they enjoyed it. They would never let
						anyone leave without eating. She never missed a second Saturday or Sunday without fixing a
						dinner. If she wasn't able to she would call some of the children in to help. But we couldn't
						keep her out of the kitchen. She always loved seeing company come. Even when she wasn't able to
						she would never let anyone leave hungry. God really gave us a wonderful and loving mother. She
						was always there to listen to her children and help in any way she could. Even though we miss
						her so much I feel God knows best and our loss is heaven's gain. You should put your trust in
						God and look forward to the day when the family circle can never be broken again.</p>

					<p><strong>ELDER CHARLES MARION JONES [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with much sadness and
						love that we will try to write an obituary of our beloved husband and father. Charles Marion
						Jones was born May ? 2, 191 -2. He passed away November 16, 1986, making his stay here on earth
						seventy-four years, five months and five days. Charlie, as he was known by all who knew and
						loved him, was the son of the late Wilburn and Martha Turner Jones. He was married to Lottie
						Hatfield Jones on June 4, 1931. To this union were born nine children: Virginia Johnson,
						Sylvania Newman, Charlene Smallwood, Ocelene Cole. Wilma Cavins, Debbie Johnson, Buck Jones,
						Roland Jones, and Bill Jones, who preceded Daddy in Death. There are fifteen grandchildren and
						three great-grandchildren. Daddy has one sister and one brother living: Rose Osborne and Mehin
						Jones. Two brothers and two sisters are deceased: Annie Cook, Mary Bryant, Johnny Jones, and
						Tilden Jones. Daddy joined the Old Regular Baptist Church on December 14, 1946 at Pilgrim Rest
						Church. He was baptized the same day by Troy Nickles and Willie Collins. Daddy came by letter
						from the Pilgrim Rest Church to Joppa the first Saturday in January, 1955. Daddy was appointed
						assistant moderator to Jerry Hall, Sr. the first Saturday in February, 1955. He then was elected
						the assistant moderator the first Saturday in September, 1955. Daddy was appointed moderator at
						the death of Jerry Hall, the first Saturday in November, 1969. Daddy served as moderator of the
						Joppa Church until the first Saturday in September, 1983. Our mother joined the Old Regular
						Baptist Church in November, 1946 at Joppa. She enjoyed many years with Daddy in the church.
						There is so much that I want to say about this very special Daddy. The love that he and Mom
						shared for the Lord made our home a warm and wonderful place to grow in. Daddy would listen to
						our problems with patience and understanding. He was loved and respected by all his children and
						all who knew him. Daddy loved the Old Regular Baptist Church. He was never happier than when he
						was in the stand and the Lord would bless him to preach. It seemed to me that a light would
						shine from within Daddy. Daddy's door was always open and anyone entering would find a welcome
						hand to shake and a warm smile. There were many nights that people would come to have Daddy lay
						his hands on them. I was small then and I was afraid for Daddy to go out to their cars. Daddy
						would tell me not to worry about him, that the Lord would take care of him. While Daddy was the
						assistant and moderator of the Old Joppa Church there were many nights that Daddy would walk the
						floor and pray for its members. He loved the church and he didn't want anything or anyone to
						hurt it in any way. Daddy loved being at church and shaking hands with his brothers and sisters.
						He loved to listen to his brothers preach and when the Lord would bless the meeting he would
						rejoice with them. When Daddy would come home from meeting where the preaching was blessed, he
						would feel so good. He couldn't wait to tell all about what a good meeting he had. Daddy was
						gifted in the scriptures of the Bible. He was a true-born child of God. He counseled his
						children and in his everyday walks of life he showed them what they must do to enter into the
						Kingdom of God. If we could only be as humble and pattern our lives after one who has left his
						light in the window. Daddy continued to preach and counsel as long as he was able. In the last
						few years of his life Daddy was very sick, but even in his sickness he would tell of visions and
						would hum and sing the songs of Zion and would clap his hands with joy. It was so hard to see
						Daddy lying in the hospital feeble and weak, but Daddy brought us up to never question the work
						of our Lord. We love and miss him very much but we feel that Daddy is at rest now. His troubles
						and worries are over. The Bible says blessed are the dead that die in Christ, their works will
						follow them. Daddy's soul is at rest under the altar of God, but will return to reunite with the
						body in the morning of the resurrection, a body liken unto the Lord. And like the song that
						Daddy loved to sing, the gates will open wide. I believe that God will welcome this soldier, for
						he has served him well. In closing I will say I can't possibly write everything that Daddy has
						meant to us. Our home is empty but our hearts will always be filled with loved for this very
						special Daddy. Written by his loving wife and family</p>

						Elder Even and Della Hamilton. Bill departed this life August 12, 1987 making his stay on earth
						seventy years and fourteen days. In the year 1936 he was married to Veda Newman and to this
						union were born three children: Gilva Horn of Prestonsburg, Kentucky, Curtis Hamilton of

						two sisters to mourn his passing: Rutherford Hamilton of Cook Station, Missouri, John L.
						Hamilton of Elkton, Maryland and Carl Hamilton of Jefferson City, Tennessee, Lillie Hammonds of
						Martin, Kentucky and Marie Clark of Pikeville, Kentucky. Bill lived in McDowell most of his life
						and was a retired coal miner. He joined the Little Rosa Regular Baptist Church in November of
						1984 and was a faithful member as long as he was able to go. His favorite song was "Great High
						Mountain" and one day while visiting the unfinished church building, Bill said that he would be
						the first to sing in the church building and he sang "Great High Mountain." 1 feel that Bill has
						climbed that mountain that he sang about and is now resting around the throne of God. Daddy
						always loved having his brothers and sisters and his many friends visit him at home and in the
						hospital. He would ask the brothers in the church to lay hands on him and pray that God would
						ease his pain. He said just a few days before his passing he would like to go home from the
						hospital where he could rest and I feel that a friend came to visit him on August 12, at I 1 a.
						m. and that friend was Jesus who took him in His arms and whispered come home to rest. Dear
						Lord, bind our hearts together with your love and help us through this separation until we meet
						our loved one again. Make us strong in your love that where he is now, we shall be one day.

					<p><strong>RHODA SLONE [Photo Not Available]</strong> By request of the family and the help of God

						who was born on November 17, 1897 being eighty-nine years, eight months and twenty-eight days of
						age at the time of her passing. Sister Rhoda Slone was the daughter of the late Isom S. and
						Linda Slone who preceded her in death. Early in life on October 1, 1917 Sister Rhoda was united
						in marriage to Green Slone who preceded her in death. Unto this union were born eleven children,
						one preceded her in death, Linda Slone, Sister Rhoda is survived by live sons : Austin Slone of
						Pippa Passes, Kentucky, Boss Slone of Hindman, Kentucky, Conard Slone of Ravenna, Ohio, John L.

						daughters: Teney Slone of Pippa Passes, Margarett Slone of Topmost, Kentucky, Merkie alone of
						Pippa Passes, Dovie Maggard of Ligonier, Indiana, and Imogene Huff of Hebron, Indiana; , one
						brother : Jasper Slone of Olive Hill, Kentucky; one half-brother : Carlie Slone of Hoyd County,
						Kentucky; two half-sisters: Ollie Holland of Danville, Kentucky and Polly Slone of Floyd County.
						Sister Rhoda also leaves to mourn her passing, thirty-nine grandchildren, forty-six
						great-grandchildren, four great-great-grandchildren, and a host of relatives and friends. Sister
						Rhoda was loved by all who knew her. On February 7, 1976 Sister Rhoda Slone gave her hand to
						join the church and was baptized on a cold winter day. The ice had to be broken on the water. I
						heard the Brothers who baptized her say she never feared the cold, icy water at all and that
						Sister Rhoda felt warm when she was led out of the water. Sister Rhoda was humble all her life.
						I can truly say Sister Rhoda was kind to all who knew her. She would always meet everyone at her
						door with a beautiful smile and no matter what time of day or night her children and
						grandchildren came to see her, Sister Rhoda was so happy to see them. She loved them all so very
						much. She would always go into the kitchen to fix something to eat. Sister Rhoda would fix the
						best she had for anyone who came to see her and always treated them with loving kindness. I feel
						so little writing this obituary of a dear, sweet mother-in-law and a sister in the Lord. Sister
						Rhoda was a shining light to all. How precious is her memory to us all. They will never be
						forgotten. Sister Rhoda was sick for a long time. She left us all with a better home to go to. I
						want to say to all her children and to all her friends and relatives, if they ever want to see
						her again, if they haven't already not put it off to fall out with sin and to fall into the arms
						,and mercies of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, for he is the doorway to heaven where there is

					<p><strong>LINA LITTLE [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is very hard to write an obituary of my

						1891 and departed this life on November 23, 1986, making her stay on earth ninety-five years,
						one month, three weeks, and one day. She was the daughter of Henry Elswick and Susana Hampton.
						Her brothers and sisters were: James, Sylvester, Caleb, Samuel, Willie, Jonnie, Martha,
						Elizabeth, Mary Alice, Sally, Dode, and Eliza Jane. All preceded her in death. Mama was first
						married to Thomas Hampton. To this union were born two children : Alvin Hampton, and Della
						Tackett of Virgie. Papaw Thomas and Alvin preceded her in death. On June 24, 1919 she was
						married to Ballard Little. To this union were born six children: Opha, Mattie, Draxie Hall,
						Luenda Burke, Irene Little of Virgie, and Allowean Little of Shelby Gap. Opha, Mattie, and papaw
						preceded her in death. She has one step-daughter, Mancie Tackett of Virgie and one step-son,
						Millis Little, who preceded her in death. She has sixteen grandchildren, thirty-one
						great-grandchildren and thirteen great-great-grandchildren. In July 1949 Mamaw joined the Long
						Fork Old Regular Baptist Church and was baptized by Elder Mart Burke and Sid Hudson. She
						remained a faithful member until the Lord called her home. Papaw's and Mamaw's door was always
						open to friends and neighbors and to lend a helping hand. When I was a little girl, I remember
						the girls cooking dinner and Papaw and Mamaw would come home from church with twelve to fifteen
						people. They would eat and then sit around and talk about church and the Bible. Mamaw lay sick
						for a long time. She was so humble, sweet and hard-working. It always pleased her when her
						family came to see her. After Mamaw was unable to get around by herself , she would sit in her
						rocking chair and talk about Heaven and her little children that had gone on before her. After
						she was bedfast, we sat by her day and night. She would reach out her feeble hand for us to
						hold. She said to her daughter one day, "Irene, lets me and you go to Heaven if it's the Lord's
						will." She was always singing those good Old Regular Baptist songs. She laid a good pattern
						before her family, friends and neighbors. I believe from the life she lived, and the work she
						did for the Lord that her soul is in the paradise of Heaven. So I want to say to the family, we
						can't sit by her bed now but by the grace of God we can go and see her again. I could write a
						book on Mamaw but space won't permit. Written by a broken-hearted granddaughter Memorial will be
						preached at the Old Longfork Regular Baptist Church the fourth Saturday and Sunday in June 1988.

						Lizzie for many years, but the last few years she got to be very close to me. She became sick
						and would call me to pray for her. After calling me a few times or coming to see me she began to
						tell how she feared God. She would tell me how she would pray to God to forgive her of her sins,
						and how she would call or go see Brother Monroe Jones, to pray for her. She would tell me how
						much confidence she had in Brother Monroe and me. But she would always say her faith was in God.
						Often she began to cry and say, "Ellis, do you think God will forgive me before I die?" My reply
						would be, "1 never believed that God would turn away a praying heart." After many months praying
						and calling me she said to me one day, "Ellis, I don't have fear of dying anymore. I feel with
						all my heart that God has forgiven me." A good feeling went through me that she was alright with
						God. She has told me of the beautiful dreams she had. Just a few days ago she called me and
						asked if she could come to my house. She wanted me to sing a song, "On The Other Side of
						Jordon." Also, "Precious Memories" and others, and hold prayer for her. She told me of an
						experience she had with God. And that she was buying her a dress to wear to church. She said she
						had a dream of buying a new dress to come to church for me to baptize her. I feel and believe
						from what she told me that she is better off today than we are. I believe her soul is at rest
						with God. I believe she put her faith in God who is the Saviour of the world and a special

						his death. Homer was the "rose" of our family. Words cannot describe this man. He touched so
						many lives with his love. Our family cannot express the love and appreciation we had for Homer.
						His heart and home were always opened for anyone, whether it be for comfort, support, help or
						just a sweet smile to say he would always be there for us. The effects of his absence will be

						and a strong shoulder to cry on if we needed to. Mom was not a member of any church but her
						belief was in the Old Regular Baptist where she attended as often as possible for as long as she
						was able. We have heard Mommie pray many times and we believe her soul is at rest. When we were
						small we would sit around the fireplace and listen to her sing the old-time hyms she loved so

						talented. She could sing (she made several recordings) and she taught herself how to
						paint--especially children's portraits. It's as though God gave her something extra because she
						was sick all the time. She wrote songs and painted pictures while confined to the hospital bed.
						In fact, that's where Birdie met God one evening in August in the Intensive Care Unit. She

						dearly on earth, our husband and dad, Denzele A. Hoffer. Denzele A. Hoffer was born September
						23, 1918 and died February 3, 1987 at the age of sixty-eight years, four months and two days. He
						was preceded in death by his father Albert Hoffer, his mother, Minnie Cooper, his only brother,
						Donald, his sister, Della Osburn and his granddaughter, Amber Marie Hoffer. He was united in
						marriage to Della Collins on April 22. 1957. Their home was blessed with four children: Karen
						Elaine Jett of Otway, Ohio, Edward Lynn Hoffer of West Union, Ohio, Anthony Wayne Hoffer of
						Otway, Ohio and Christian, at home, and by a previous marriage, two sons: James Arnold and
						Donald Ray Hoffer, both of Middletown, Ohio. He is also survived by six sisters: Estella Blanche
						Tumbleson of Xenia, Ohio, Lola Kauffman of Centerville, Ohio, Viola Jewett of West Portsmouth,
						Ohio, Mildred Campbell of Toledo, Ohio, Donnah Helwig of Lucasville, Ohio and Audrey Dingus of

						Church of Hoffer Hill on March 30, 1980. Beloved Denzele, Lord grant the days to pass swiftly
						that we, your friends and family, who loved you so, can meet you again in your new home. There
						will always be a vacant place in our home that no one else could ever fill, but with God, he's

					<p><strong>STELLA WATSON [Photo Not Available]</strong> By the request of the family, I will try to
						write an obituary of Sister Stella Watson. Sister Stella entered into eternal rest Saturday, May
						23, 1987 at the McDowell Regional Hospital, McDowell, Kentucky. Sister Stella was born December
						27, 1911, being seventy-five years, four months and twenty-six days old at the time of her
						natural death. Sister Stella was married to Burton Watson, the son of Morgan and Nancy Slone
						Watson on March 31, 193 2. Sister Stella was the daughter of Ira G. and Sarah Margarett Watts
						Sparkman. She was preceded in death by her father and mother, her husband, and one son, Wendell
						Watson. She is survived by her children: Fred of Kendallville, Indiana, Orvis of Valley City,
						Ohio, and Clifford of Painesville, Ohio, Ruby Gibson of Dayton, Ohio, Lorenia Lykins, and Grace
						Hicks, both of Cleveland, Ohio, and Cora Craft of Wayland, Kentucky. She also leaves one

						Passes, Bertha Sparkman of Topmost, Kentucky, Sally Holbrooks of Pedro, Ohio, and sixteen
						grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren and a host of friends and relatives. Sister Stella
						joined the Ball Branch Church of Old Regular Baptist at Mousie, Kentucky in 1955. She was
						baptized by Elder Burton Howard. She brought her membership to Caney Fork at Raven, Kentucky in
						Knott County the third Saturday in February, 1964. She remained a member until death. I have
						lived next door to Sister Stella for several years and found her trying to live her life
						Christ-like. She was a person of few words, never having too much to say, but as Brother Earl
						Slone said, "She was always ready to talk with you about the Lord." She was very thankful for
						her children, always worrying and concerned. She and Burton talked to me several times about
						them. So children, you are like I am, an orphan in this world, but you can have a spiritual
						father and mother if you so desire. Jesus loves you more than Mom or Dad did. He will never
						leave you nor forsake you. He is closer than you think. So don't say good-bye to Mom, for
						good-bye is forever; just say so long for a little while and, with the Lord's help, 1 will meet
						you in heaven where I believe she is. Don't say that unless you put it in action, because faith
						without works is dead. If you don't do something and draw near to God, then it will be good-bye
						forever. Children, I love every one of you and it would give n my heart great joy to see each of
						you children fall out of love with the world and fall in love with the things your mother loved,
						which are the things of Christ. Repent and be born again. We here at the Caney Fork Church, will
						miss Sister Stella very much. She was always there if she was able to come. She always gave her
						attention to the preaching, wanting to hear the word of Christ preached. So let's all try to
						meet Sister Stella in heaven with the help of the Lord.</p>

						Hospital in Pikeville, Kentucky. He was seventy-five years of age. He leaves to mourn his
						passing, his beloved wife, Ilma Hall of Robinson Creek, Kentucky and his only son, Elder Jimmy

						He is survived by two great-grandchildren, Ashley Nicole and Casaundra Ellen. He loved his
						grandchildren and great-grandchildren very much. He also leaves to mourn his passing, two
						sisters and two brothers: Stella Johnson, Indian Creek, Kentucky, Bell Tackett of Ashland,
						Kentucky, Allard Hall of Virgie, Kentucky, and Ed Hall of Virgie, Kentucky. On August 31, 1928
						he was married to Ilma Tackett. They had attended school together from childhood. Ilma was
						sixteen and Wilburn was nineteen when they were married. They shared life's joys and sorrows for
						over fifty-six years until death parted them. Brother Wilburn worked for Consolidation Coal
						Company and Beth Elkhorn for a total of forty-five years. He enjoyed twelve years of retired
						life. He was so proud of a pin he received showing he was a member of the union for fifty years.
						Brother Wilburn joined the Regular Baptist Church, May 10, 1953 and after telling an experience
						of grace was baptized by Elder Mahon Burke and Elder Roy Hudson. He was a devoted and faithful
						soldier for the Lord for the rest of his life. His fellow brethren began to take note of his
						devotion to the church. The low, still voice seemed to press on their minds to ordain him as a
						deacon. He was ordained a deacon at the Old Elkhorn Church. Brother Wilburn fulfilled his charge
						as a deacon with all sincerety. He loved the Hemphill Regular Baptist Church where his
						membership was at his death. He was always worrying about things that needed to be done at the
						church even after he got very sick. One great joy of his life was having his son, Jimmy, walk by
						his side in the church for over ten years. Jimmy felt so honored to get to kneel down
						and-wash-his dad's feet and so proud to have his father's name. Brother Jimmy's given name is
						Wilburn Hall, Jr. Wilburn was a humble, quiet man that did so many things that we didn't notice
						until he was gone. He gave so much and asked for nothing in return. As the pains and trauma
						increased, his faith seemed to get stronger. Then it just seemed like that low, still voice
						spoke again and said, "Wilburn I am going to give you ease. I am going to take away all pain. I
						am going to let you see something you have never seen before." He had been in a coma all day
						before he died. That night he began to reach his arms toward heaven and he said several times,
						"I'm in heaven, I'm in heaven." His beloved companion said, "Honey, did you see Jesus?" He said,
						"Yes." Jesus knew how much Ilma and Jimmy and the family loved Wilburn. Perhaps that low, still
						voice just said again, "Wilburn, I'm going to give you a little more strength. You tell your
						family where you are. What more comforting words could there be? What better news could be
						received than those precious words, "I'm in heaven"?</p>

						hard to live a good life. We feel that his reward is in heaven. When Dad lay in the hospital
						bed, he told me to tell the other children to be good to our mother after he was gone. I told
						Mommy what he had said that same day. We prayed so hard for God to leave him with us if it was
						His will, but we feel that the Lord wanted Daddy to be with Him. We are so thankful and grateful
						for the time we did have with him. Now all we can say is, "Dad, sleep on, we will be together
						soon. We love you and miss you, but it will be a great reunion when we all meet on that
						beautiful shore." Brother Jimmey joined the Philadelphia Old Regular Baptist Church the third
						Saturday in July, 1961. He was ordained a deacon on the third Saturday in April, 1962. He served
						the Philadelphia Church as a deacon for eighteen years. He took his letter to the Sweet Home
						Church and served it about two years. Then he got his letter and brought it to the Pikeville
						Church and served it until his passing. Sister Arvie has lost a wonderful husband, the children
						a wonderful father, the Old Regular Baptist Church a great soldier, and the community a great

						February 29, 1920 in the state of Kentucky. He departed this life February 19, 1987, making his
						stay on earth sixty-six years, eleven months and twenty-one days. Chester Hamilton was the son
						of the late Elder John B. and Lula Jane Hamilton. Early in life he met and married Opal Johnson,
						on October 10, 1936. Blessed to this union were nine children. One preceded him in death in
						infancy. Left to mourn their loss are: five sons, Aaron B. of Grethel, Kentucky, Ishamel T. of
						Columbus, Ohio, Daniel Edd of Teaberry, Kentucky, Randell D. of Columbus, Ohio, and Amos C. of
						Jackson, Michigan; three daughters: Mrs. Emery (Barbara) Keathley of Elyria, Ohio, Joyce Akers
						of Grethel, Kentucky, and Mrs. Estill (Helen) Hamilton of Albion, Michigan; seventeen
						grandchildren, Lind five .ii eat-grandchildren also mourn the loss of their loving grandfather.
						He also leaves behind a host of friends and relatives, including three brothers, Erasmus
						Hamilton of Ligon, Kentucky, John Wess Hamilton of Allen Park, Michigan, and Elder Palmer
						Hamilton of Marshall, Michigan; three sisters Pauline Hamilton, Mrs. Lloyd (Nadene) Ray, both of
						Ligon, Kentucky, and Mrs. Ernest (Priscilla) Hamilton of Piketon, Ohio. Two brothers, Ranold
						Hamilton of Detroit, Michigan and Paul Hamilton of Teaberry, Kentucky, preceded him in death. He
						joined New Salem Church July 4, 1959 and was baptized by Elder Johny Hall and Elder Sam Thomas.
						Being an honest man all of his life, he taught his children to be honest. Providing good
						counseling to family and friends, his home was always open to all. He enjoyed helping people and
						visiting the sick. His conversation always concerned the goodness of God. Recently, family and
						friends joined Chester and his wife, Opal, in the celebration of their fiftieth anniversary. We,
						the family, feel he traded a world of sorrow for a home of peace and joy. We would like to say
						to the children who haven't made peace with God, you must deny yourselves and take up the cross.
						Follow a close and narrow path to receive a righteous crown. Remember, your loving father was as
						the words of Apostle Paul, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, 1 have kept
						the faith: Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
						righteous judge shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto them also that love his
						appearing." Timothy 4=1-8. His memorial will be preached July 30 and 31, 1988, at his home.

					<p><strong>MONROE OUSLEY [Photo Not Available]</strong> By the help of the good Lord, I'll try to
						write an obituary of my dear husband. Elder Monroe Ousley was born November 4, 1909 at Dock.
						Kentucky. He was the son of Thomas Ousley and Sarah Stephens Ousley. His life here on earth was
						seventy-seven years, five months and twenty-one days. He was married to Bertha Sizemore on March
						10, 1930. We were married fifty-seven years and had a very happy life together until death came
						and took him. Mourning for him are his wife, three sons and two daughters, whom lie dearly
						loved. His surviving family is: his wife, Bertha, and children, Rufus J. Ousley, Wilmington,
						Ohio, Thomas R. Ousley, Franklin, Ohio, James D. Ousley, Carlisle, Ohio, Eva L. Lovely, Camden,
						Ohio, and Sarah A. Hale, Lebanon, Ohio. There are sixteen grandchildren, ten
						great-grandchildren; two brothers, Alonzo Ousley, Dayton, Ohio, and Newton Ousley, Franklin,
						Ohio; one sister, Josie Litton, Martin, Kentucky. He was a faithful member of the Old Regular
						Baptist Church approximately forty-five years. He went every Saturday and Sunday for as long as
						he was able to go. He liked to go and visit all of the churches in all of the Associations as
						often as he could. He was a moderator to a wonderful little church in Okeechobee, Florida, and
						hated to leave, but he was getting more sick than usual. He said he was not able to moderate as
						he should, so he came back to Ohio. He was a member of the House of Prayer Church at the time of
						his passing away. He dearly loved this church. So, I want to thank all of the brothers and
						sisters from all of the churches who came and visited him in the hospital. So, sleep on, we will
						meet you some sweet day. So, I say to the children that don't know my God, get right with God
						and meet Dad and me up in Heaven and that will be a wonderful reunion. Written by his wife,

					<p><strong>ALPHA COMBS [Photo Not Available]</strong> As the prophet Job compared our lives to a
						flower, it blooms for a season then dies and ceases to live, so it is with our lives here on
						earth. On November 4, 1913, in the home of the late Frank Grigsby and Hattie Terry Grigsby, a
						baby girl was born. They named her Alpha. At that time she was the flower of their home and as
						time moved on, Alpha grew to be a beautiful young woman. In early life she met and married Jay
						Combs. Unto this union were born six children: Cledis, Thurl, Venice, Elwood, J. B., and Alpha
						has two brothers : Ward and Clyde; and five sisters: Hazel. Audrey, Opal, Mildred, and Jeane.
						She was also blessed with thirteen grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. All these
						mentioned are left to mourn her passing. Also not to leave out Alpha's neighbors and friends; we
						all miss her very much. Now, that dreadful disease, cancer, has preyed upon her. It can't bother
						her anymore because on July 7, 1987 God called her home to live with him. I can safely say to
						the children and Jay that Mother will bloom as a flower again in Heaven. God has a flower garden
						for the people to dwell in that he has saved. So it behooves us to do as Alpha did to go to God
						by faith. Our souls can rest in the paradise of that beautiful garden that God has for His
						people to live in after this life is over. So, let us not forget the day that Alpha enjoyed
						these few years and months before she left us. We can do like her if we want to and when this
						life is over join her in Heaven as we believe her soul is there today. Written by Coy Combs,

					<p><strong>SOLLIE HUDSON [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with a heavy heart that we try to

						at Virgie, Kentucky and went to our Lord April 29, 1987. He was the son of the late Andy and
						Dillie Hudson. He had two brothers and six sisters. Two sisters survive. On April 10, 1919 he
						married Chloe Tackett Hudson. To this union were born thirteen children. two boys and eleven
						girls. Their names are: Collie, Lonier, Laviers, Vonier, June. Lori, Justine, Lydia, Deforest,
						Gloria, Neva Jo, Elizabeth and Irma. Four girls and one son preceded him in death. Their names
						were: Laviers. June, Lori. Lydia, and Deforest. He was a retired coal miner. He was a member of
						the Enterprise Old Regular Baptist Church for twenty-one years. He was an ordained elder. Dad
						was a faithful member of his church and in recent years he didn't drive, but he was ready and
						sitting on his porch waiting for his church brothers and sisters to pick him up and take him to
						church with them. Dad can best be remembered sitting on his porch and watching traffic go by. He
						loved to watch the mountains turn green in spring and the colors that fall brings. He loved the
						snow in winter and best of all he loved his Lord, his wife and children. Dad, we love you and
						miss you and pray to be with you in Heaven. His memorial will be preached the fifth Saturday and
						Sunday in July, 1988.</p>

					<p><strong>LESTA JANE BLACKBURN TACKETT [Photo Not Available]</strong> On October 18, 1908, a
						daughter was born into the family of Elder A. D. and Spicey Ann Johnson Blackburn. Thus began a
						life that was destined to touch so deeply those around her. This child was named Lesta Jane
						Blackburn and she was the eldest of eight children. Her brothers and sisters included: George
						W., Goldia, Kelsey, Corba, Marie, Reed, and A. D., Jr. Lesta learned early the responsibilities
						and love imposed by being a member of such a large family. She was also constantly exposed to
						the preachings of the Old Regular Baptist Church and her father, Elder A. D. Blackburn, and this
						exposure would greatly influence her later life. As a child, Lesta became friends with George D.
						Tackett and this friendship developed into a love and respect that resulted in marriage on March
						3, 1927. This love and respect withstood the trials and troubles of time and lasted for sixty
						years, one month and twenty-one days. Even though separated by her death on May 19, 1987, it
						remains a source of comfort in the heart of her husband for the rest of his life. In 1933,
						approximately six years after her marriage, Lesta followed her father's teachings and joined the
						Old Regular Baptist Church. It was a commitment that she maintained for fifty-four years on
						earth and still shares in heaven. This commitment is the source of her wisdom, love and strength
						and it dictated the way she taught and disciplined her children. Into her marriage with George
						D. Tackett, five children were born: Roland A. Tackett in 1927, Joe Jack Tackett in 1928,
						Charles L. Tackett in 1931, Eva Jane Tackett in 1936, and Georgia D. Tackett in 1939. In
						addition to her children, Lesta's love included eleven grandchildren and sixteen
						great-grandchildren, at the time of her passing. As a mother, Lesta was totally selfless in her
						giving. She offered wisdom to the shallow, strength to the weak and humility to the strong. None
						of her children had a problem too small to be ignored, nor a problem too great to be challenged.
						Her beaming smile and happy banter at all her family gatherings reflected the tremendous pride
						and love that she felt in her children. As a result of her ability to find pride and enjoyment
						in her family, she lived a very happy life. However, even in the most happy of lives, there are
						tragic moments. It is often in the moments that the real strength of life is evidenced. In her
						life, Lesta&nbsp; 'o" her mother, father, and fifteen-month-old son, Joe Jack. In addition, she
						lost tier brother, George W., sisters, Corba and Kelsey, but she had the fortitude to survive
						and the strength to continue. Even as she met the most tragic moment of all at the end of her
						life, her questions and directions displayed the selfless concern and strength that was Lesta's.
						Her remarks were not wasted in a whining fear of death, but rather, they reflected the concern
						and strength of this beautiful person. "Did you call so-and-so? Was lie aright?" "Is the baby
						O.K..?" "Does she need a dress?" and finally, "You all look in on George, he will need your
						help." She left a legacy of strength for those who survive that we can either tremble in awe of,
						or we can try to emulate. Therefore, in conclusion, for this legacy of strength we can say,
						"Thank you, Mamaw.", but into this great void created by your absence, we will cry our tears and
						beartbrokenly proclaim, "We love you, Mamaw!" Written by the family </p>

					<p><strong>ARBEY LLOYD STRATTON [Photo Not Available]</strong> Arbey Lloyd Stratton, age'
						sixty-nine, passed away Monday, January 19, 1987 at the Pikeville Methodist Hospital. He was
						born at Ivel, Kentucky on February 20, 1917 to the late John Kelly and Bertha Lee Elliot
						Stratton. He served in the U. S. Navy during World War II. He was a member of the New Salem Old
						Regular Baptist Church at Harold, Kentucky. He is survived by his wife, Kathryn Calhoun
						Stratton; two daughters, Mrs. Nelson (Patty) Radwan, Mrs. Charles (Becky) Francis, one
						step-daughter, Mrs. Mike (Peggy) Glavaris; three brothers and six sisters. He was preceded in
						death by two brothers, Marvin Stratton and John K. Stratton, Jr. and one sister, Opal Todd. He
						also leaves four granddaughters, Angela and Michele Radwan of Lexington, Kentucky, Kathi and
						Charla Francis of Pikeville, Kentucky, and two step-granddaughters, Christi and Sabrina Glavaris
						of Lexington, Kentucky. Arbey joined the New Salem Church of Old Regular Baptist on October 5,
						1986 and was baptized on October 12, 1986 in the river at Ivel, Kentucky in front of the family
						farm where he spent his childhood years. Arbey's newfound spiritual relationship with God, the
						church, and Brothers and Sisters was so overwhelmingly wonderful that he wanted to share his joy
						with his family and friends. Even in his weak and failing physical condition, the love of Jesus
						was reflected in his sparkling eyes as family and friends came to visit him in the hospital.
						Arbey planted the seed of friendship with everyone he knew and his bountiful harvest of friends
						was his well-deserved reward. Arbey was a devoted family man who unselfishly thought of his
						family first and himself second. He always felt a strong bond of affection for his parents, his
						brothers and sisters and their families. He so loved his wife, children and grandchildren that
						he was constantly wanting to do things for them. He showed his love in so many ways that his
						departing will leave a void in the lives of his loved ones that will never be filled in this
						life, but may be renewed in the afterlife. We will attempt to fill this aching void with the
						countless recollections of the good days spent with Arbey when his health was good. Our loss is
						truly heaven's gain. Written by Kathryn and Becky</p>

					<p><strong>MAGGIE MAE HAMILTON [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with a sad and broken heart that
						we will try to write an obituary of a dear wife and mother, Maggie Mae Hamilton. She was born
						September 9. 19_'8 and died April 3, 1987, making her stay on earth fifty-eight years, six
						months and twenty-five days. She was the daughter of the late John H. and Mary Alice Hamilton.
						She was married to Willie B. Hamilton, the son of the late Buck and Minnie Hamilton on April 26,
						1944 and unto this union were born eight children, six boys and two girls: Lorene Rogers, Elsie
						Bell Keathley, Shirlene Hamilton, Linda Gail Himilton, Rosetta Hamilton, all of Teaberry,
						Kozetta Wallen of Prestonsburg, Danny Hamilton of Teaberry, and Amos Hamilton of Homer,
						Michigan. She was preceded in death by her mother and father, two brothers and one sister. She
						leaves to mourn her death, her husband, Willie B. Hamilton, eight children, thirteen
						grandchildren and one great-grandchild. She also leaves one sister, Ethel Hollifield and one
						brother, Nollie Hamilton, both of Teaberry, and many friends and relatives. She joined the Old
						Regular Baptist Church on November 22, 1964 and was baptized on Thanksgiving Day, November 27,
						in a creek in front of her home. She had her membership at Pilgrim's Home Church for twenty-two
						years. She was a faithful member, but her illness prevented her from attending church the past
						few years of her life. When she couldn't be with her brothers and sisters, her heart was with
						them. She never forgot the need for prayers. I know she has prayed many prayers for her family,
						as well as others. She suffered from emphysema and many other diseases for many years. Her last
						few months were filled with sickness and sorrow. Her mother died just six months and
						twenty-three days before she did. God decided she had suffered enough. He needed a new angel, so
						he chose her. We are so lonesome here without her and miss her more each day. Our only comfort
						is that we feel our loss is Heaven's gain, and that someday we can meet her again. Written by

					<p><strong>MOLLIE MAE OSBORNE [Photo Not Available]</strong> With a loving memory and a loss I
						cannot express I will try to write an obituary of my mother, Mollie Mae Osborne. She was born
						December 7, 1906 to sister Deliah Tacket Osborne and Elder William Osborne. She departed this
						life October 28, 1985, making her stay here on earth seventy-eight years, eight months and
						twenty-eight days. At an early age she met and married brother Kelly Osborne and unto this union
						were born seven children, three boys and, four girls. The first son died in infancy. Another son
						died in early manhood. He died suddenly with a heart attack. James Kelly, Jr. lives on Indian
						Creek, Mrs. Jewel Mullins lives at Haven Hill, Ohio, Mrs. Gloria Hunter lives at Geneva, Ohio,
						Mrs. Beulah Johnson lives on Indian Creek, Kentucky, Mrs. Alta Slone lives at Robinson Creek,
						Kentucky. She has eleven grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren, and one
						great-great-grandchild, and they all loved Mama so much, and she loved them just as much. I've
						heard her say many times she couldn't tell much difference between her grandchildren and her own
						children. Mom loved all her children. Her grandchildren brought her much joy and comfort. Mother
						joined the Old Regular Baptist Church at Enterprise at the May meeting, 1933, with a wonderful
						experience, and was baptized and was a faithful member until Jesus called her home. 1 don't
						think anyone enjoyed the old-time preaching and singing more. She was also studious and
						consistent in her reading of her Bible. She was always pleased to have her brothers and sisters
						to visit her home. She loved to cook for them and make them comfortable. She and Dad would
						always have a crowd of peope at church time. Some would come-the , day before church and stay
						all night. I have seen all our beds full and some sleeping on the floor, but Mother was always
						glad to have them. She would be up early in the morning getting breakfast singing those good old
						sweet songs. Space doesn't permit me to tell the whole story of her life, but those who knew her
						would have to acknowledge her sincerity and steadfastness in what she believed. Mother hadn't
						been well for many years, but she bore her sickness patiently. She was active and alert until
						she had the stroke. She left us with such good hopes I have no doubts about where she is. It's
						where God has prepared for those who love and serve him. She said a few days before she died,
						she had seen the Apostle Paul ascending to Heaven. She had the most beautiful countenance on her
						face when she told us. She also saw something coming and she was hoping how quick it would come.
						That was the day before she died. I believe it was Jesus with a band of angels, because she
						wanted them to hurry. Mother has two sisters living, Rose Johnson and Rilla Hall, both from
						Michigan. They were very close. I'm sure there was a great love between them and an emptiness in
						their hearts when Mother had to leave us, but I feel they will all meet again in that Heavenly
						home. Mother stayed with me the last four years and only God knows how I miss her. Mother was
						blessed to see three of her daughters baptized into the church of her choice, Jewel, Beulah and
						me. Oh, how she would shoul God's praises when she washes our feet. So, sleep on, Mother until
						that Resurrection morning when we all meet again in that beautiful home where there is no death
						nor sorrow. Written by her broken-hearted daughter, Alta</p>

					<p><strong>JOSEPH VERLIN MULLINS [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with tear-dimmed eyes and

						and Nellie Burke Mullins and departed this life August 22, 1987. The Lord gave him fiftyseven
						years, some through pain and suffering and many days of happiness and joy. Verlin grew up and

						married Nancy Crawford. They shared thirty-seven years of life's pain and joys. To this union
						were born six children: Linda Dotson, Southfork, Virginia, James Mullins, Wise, Virginia, Ralph
						Mullins, and Christy Mullins, both of the home. In addition to his children, he is survived by
						his wife, Nancy Crawford Mullins and five grandchildren whom he loved and enjoyed. His
						broken-hearted mother, Nellie Mullins, and his two sisters are mourning their loss. Verlin was a
						retired United Mine Worker who spent his life providing for his family. He was an honest man who
						was a good citizen and neighbor. We have heard him talk many times of the Lord and that sweet
						fellowship that all born again Christians share with the Master. Nancy, your hurt and loss seems
						too great to bear, but trust in Him in the silent hours of the night and He will help you
						through. To his children, the head of the house is gone, but let his life and Godly conversation
						be your guide when you need help and feel alone. His wife will miss him most of all, but lift up
						your head and trembling hands, and upon His rock take a stand; for the Lord will ransom his
						redeemed, then all your loss, hurt and pain will seem but a dream, for our Brother, your
						husband, has entered a far Serener Clime, where peace, love and joy abound. So, to the family,
						consider your great loss Heaven's gain, and look to the Author of all Life and pray that you may

						Morehead State University in 1974 with a degree in Electricity and Electronics. He served in the
						National Guard for sixteen years, and rose to the rank of Captan. Chuck never met a stranger. He
						always had good words to say and never had anything bad to say about anyone. His family was his
						life! He was a loving son, a devoted husband, father and brother. He worked long and hard in the
						coal mines to be able to provide us with anything and everything that we may want or need. At
						work, he always prided himself in giving 110%, expecting nothing but his pay. His co-workers
						always became his buddies. Other than providing for his family, his favorite times were spent
						outdoors with either a rod and reel or his old Ithica pump shotgun. Giving of himself to others
						was his greatest gift. Anyone who had the chance to meet him always walked away with a good
						feeling. God gave him this gift, and he used it to the fullest. If he could have, he would have
						been everybody's protector. So, even though we no longer have him with us, there is no way he
						will ever be forgotten. Chuck will live in our hearts forever!!! Let us who remain pray that we
						may be worthy of Chuck's love and good will, given by him so freely, by sharing this same love
						and good will with those we meet along life's pathway. Lord willing, a memorial meeting will be

						God one time before that he would do better if God would let him get better of that cancer, and
						God did let him get better, but like so many of us have done, he soon forgot the promise he made
						to God. In a very humble manner he began to tell me it was different this time the cancer came
						back, but he had been praying and felt God had forgiven him of his sins. Later he joined the
						Little Creek Old Regular Baptist Church and was baptized by Brother Frank Hopkins and Brother
						Don Little. Even though Brother Bill has been missed by his family and friends, his companion
						has missed him so very much, but by his testimony we feel he left a world of pain and sorrows
						and went to a world of joy and peace. We feel his soul is resting in the paradise of God until
						that resurrection morning when God will bring the soul back and it will unite with the body and
						God will change the natural body Lo a spiritual body and go to a heavenly country to live
						forever and forever. So, to his companion, family and friends, my prayer is that each one will
						repent and be born again with the spirit of God and we can meet again around the throne of God.

					<p><strong>MARTIN FRASURE [Photo Not Available]</strong> Just one week ago today it became
						increasingly clear to me that 1, or someone just as dear to Brother Mart, would be standing as I
						now stand before you and read to you the following obituary. I pray that those of you in our
						listening audience will have been blessed, as I am sure most of you have, with the opportunity
						to have known this family in a more personable way than what this brief introduction will give
						you concerning the life and achievements of Brother Mart, however, for those of you who were not
						acquainted or blessed to know Brother Mart as we, here in brief is a small introduction. Brother
						Mart Frasure was born October 12, 1908 at Garrett, Kentucky, to the parents of Jack and Susie
						Frasure. He departed this life after an extended illness September 25, 1986, just a few days
						short of his seventyeighth birthday. Brother Mart leaves to mourn their loss a host of friends
						and relatives and his most immediate family includes: Sister Alvie Lawson Frasure, his loving
						companion since their marriage in July, 1933. To this blessed union were born the following nine
						children: Dean Frasure, Clennon Frasure, Shelby Brewer, Barbara Back, Sandra Rowe, Shirley
						Frasure, all of North Judson, Indiana, and Rayburn Frasure of Denham, Indiana, Jane Pendle of
						Niles, Michigan, and Donna Chesney of Muncie, Indiana. He also leaves twenty granchildren, six
						great-grandchildren and many of us who adopted Brother Mart as father ...a title he earned over
						and over again and wore the name so well. Does the song title, "I Wonder What They're Doing Up
						In Heaven Today" bring back memories ? How many can recall the times when Brother Mart and
						Sister Alvie together would begin the song and during the middle Brother Mart would get so happy
						that he would and up shouting the praises of God, to where Sister Alvie would have to sing from
						memory the next verses because Brother Mart was slapping the song book against the palm of his
						hand and shouting, "Brother Earl, or Children, I'm going home.'? Brother Mart, bless God, you
						are not wondering what they are doing up in heaven today...Today, you have left that to us . . .
						Now we are wondering what you are doing up in heaven today. We wonder, also, how we will miss
						your and Sister Alvie's sweet melodious voices blending together to bring us good old-fashioned,
						deep-down, God-felt tears of sweet joy when you sang, "I Am A Poor Pilgrim of Sorrow." Never
						again will you need to sing that song, Brother Mart, now we have that need. I wonder, also, how
						many will miss seeing you and Sister Alvie enter the several churches you were blessed to visit
						and hear the whispers circulate around the congregation, "There comes them singing people from
						the Little Alvie Church." "Oh, what's his name, you know, the fellow that can sing so pretty.
						Anyway, just listen. I hope he sings "I Have A Father Gone To Glory." Gee, can he sing that! I
						wonder! I wonder what it was like in 1952 when a group of faithful believers in Christ Jesus got
						together and founded the Little Alvie Church. It must have been a sweet day in the life of
						Brother Mart to see his dream take shape. When board after board was placed upon a foundation
						and the church we are assembled in today is here chiefly by the enduring effort of Brother Mart
						and Sister A1vie...How many quilts and rummage sales went into paying off this building? How
						many prayers went up to God to bless it? I wonder. I wonder how lonely at times it must have
						felt when the congregation got down to almost two ...Alvie and Mart, but Bless God, I don't
						wonder where the help came from to save it and its blessed name, The Little Alvie Church of
						Jesus Christ, Regular Baptist Faith and Order. You know, I'm made to wonder that when the Bible
						speaks of the office of Deacon and what kind of men it would take to fill that office ...I
						wonder if we ever thanked God enough for giving us the Old Regular Baptist Church and a Deacon
						in the person of Brother Mart. So, what do I say to these people that have come here to honor
						you, Brother Mart? I wonder if that is what I would say to you if you and I could have talked
						about this ...I could say that we loved you...but you knew that ...I could say we miss you
						...and that wouldn't be any surprise ...you know how you and I would kid around with each other
						...I probably would tell you that since you ARE up there around God's throne ...I wonder what
						your voice sounds like when you sing that heavenly song...If I would have that last remembering
						conversation...I'd probably frown at you for momentarily refusing to shake my hand or giving me
						a hug to let me know how long it had been since you had seen me ...and that big smile and robust
						arms open...you would enclose me in your embrace so tight that I could feel the energy of
						brotherly love and the closeness of uncle and nephew sharing a brief moment...you know with all
						of this between us, your close-knit family that hugged and loved you to no end...Alvie, that
						unwaveringly waited on you, hand and foot, day and night ...your family, who never left your
						home and sat at your feet trying to find a way to help you..all of these wonderful things you
						left us ...you left us a great legacy, Brother Mart ...and we miss you ...AND IT'S NO WONDER!

					<p><strong>CRO CAR ADAMS [Photo Not Available]</strong> Brother Cro Car Adams of Eubank, Kentucky
						was born September 22, 1909 in Letcher County. He would have been seventy-eight years old
						tomorrow. He was the son of Martha and General Adams of Ison, Kentucky. Cro passed away at the
						Humana Lake Cumberland Hospital after a long illness. Cro was a member of the Rose of Sharon
						Church and he had been a member of the Regular Baptist Church for fifty-three- years. Cro
						married Cindy Whitaker on February 17, 1932. During their fifty-five years together they had
						five children, four girls and one son. The daughters are Delores Adams and Lenora Jones, both of
						Eubank, Kentucky, Barbara Adams of Waynesburg, Kentucky, and Angeletta Fields of Pikeville,
						Kentucky. They have twelve grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Cro had two brothers and
						four sisters to precede him in death. They are Minta Adams, Cinda Caudill, Dixie Caudill, Boone
						Adams, and Watson Adams. Cro left behind one sister and three brothers to mourn his passing.
						They are, Beulah Hampton of Jeremiah, Lee Adams of Whitesburg, Herman Adams of Hazard and Curt
						Adams of Ison, Kentucky. Cro was a perosn who read his Bible often and enjoyed discussing what
						he had read. His Bible was full of notes on verses he had read and researched. There were two
						verses found written on a note in Cro's Bible that I think that he would want to leave to his
						children. They are, "Remember thy Creator in the days of your youth." Ecclesiastes 12:1 and,
						"Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven and all these things shall be added unto you." Matthew
						6:33. In a dream Cro had, he fought beside Christ in the Battle of Armageddon against increasing
						numbers of the wicked. In the end of the dream, Cros saw the righteous lifted above the
						multitudes and descend into Heaven. Cro has fought his battle here on earth and just as he sang
						while in the hospital, he is now singing with his family and friends around the throne of God.

					<p><strong>ELVIRA TACKETT [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with a sad and lonely heart that I
						will try, with the help of the good Lord, to write the obituary of my dear mother, Elvira Adams
						Tackett. She was the daughter of R. B. Adams and Sillar Johnson Adams. She was born March 6,
						1912 and passed away December 30, 1986, making her stay here seventyfour years, nine months and
						twenty-four days. Mom was married to Solomon Tackett October 20, 1929 and to this union were
						born seven children. One son, Kermit Odis, passed away at the age of six months and seven days,
						leaving two daughters and four sons to mourn their loss. They are Marie Tackett of Kings
						Mountain, Kentucky, Nola Kanes and Nornvel of Dorton, Kentucky, and Carnvel, Roy, and William of
						Joanancy, Kentucky. She also leaves a host of nieces, nephews, and friends to mourn her passing.
						Mom was so lonely after Dad passed away in August, 1974. She loved her children very much, but
						we couldn't fill the emptiness in her heart left there when Dad passes away. Mom came to live
						with us when she became too ill to stay in her own home. It was so hard to watch her suffering.
						She smothered so terribly and she hated to be alone, so we sat with her every night. I miss her
						but 1 believe she is so much better off. She isn't crippled and she isn't lonely anymore. I
						believe she and Daddy are together now where there will be no more partings. Mom joined the Old
						Regular Baptist Church in March, 1953 and lived a faithful life until her death. Before Dad
						died, they would walk for miles to go to church, since niether of them ever drove a car. They
						went as long as it was possible for them to get there. Mom went to church whenever the
						opportunity arose until she became bedridden. Until her death, she had church at her home as
						often as possible. Mom and Dad were so humble and good to everyone. We loved them so much, but
						God loved them more. He called them to a better home where they are not suffering now. Mom, I
						have a hope deep in my heart that I will meet you, Daddy and Kermit in Heaven where we won't
						have to part again. How wonderful to spend eternity together singing praises and glorifying God.
						Mom and Dad, I miss you both, but I praise God for the peace I feel, believing as I do, that
						you're safe at home waiting for the rest of us. Written by her lonely daughter and son-in-law,
						Marie and Emmitt Tackett</p>

					<p><strong>HARRIET WIREMAN ARNETT [Photo Not Available]</strong> Mrs. Harriet Wireman Arnett, the
						oldest of fourteen children born to Lewis and Viney Oliver Wireman on April 1, 1987, passed from
						this life Sunday, April 26, 1987, making her stay on earth ninety years and twenty-five days.
						She was blessed with a long, useful and fruitful life, and was an inspiration to us all. She was
						united in marriage to Burney Arnett on April 7, 1915, and to this union seven children were
						born. She was preceded in death by her husband, Burney Arnett, January 22, 1978, one son, Arthur
						Arnett, August 5, 1967, a four-year-old daughter, Dorothy Arnett, November 13, 1920, four
						sisters: Curtis Wireman, Sally Hale, Polly Wireman, Loney Lovely, and one brother, Warnie
						Wireman. She leaves to mourn her passing, one son, Richard Arnett of Albion, Michigan; four
						daughters, Mabel Hopkins of Reading, Michigan, Ruth Shepherd, Sandra Shepherd and Marie Whitaker
						of Gunlock, Kentucky; four sisters, Liney Hale, of Lima, Ohio, Elizabeth Wireman of Medaryville,
						Indiana, Edna Hale of Medaryville, and Wealthy Montgomery of Lima, Ohio; four brothers, Kennie
						Wireman of Oliver, Michigan, Ollie Wireman of Waldo, Kentucky, Willard Wireman of Waldo, and
						Homer Wireman of Bradenton, Florida; seventeen grandchildren, twenty-seven great-grandchildren
						and a host of nieces, nephews and friends. Mother joined the United Baptist Church in the spring
						of 1943 and was baptized by Reverend Ramey Whitaker. She lived a dedicated Christian life
						twenty-four hours a day, every day. She loved the Lord deeply and was a faithful follower. Her
						faith and commitment were unshakable. She was an excellent example to her church, family,
						community and neighbors. Mother read her Bible regularly, and Psalms was her favorite book of
						the Bible. Mother walked very closely and wisely before the Lord. God had a special ministry for
						Mother that no one else could do. Nothing is too difficult, for the Lord hears and intercedes.
						Mother was so alert and her mind was so good. She took care of her affairs. She was concerned
						about the church and the well-being of the community. Her family was totally devoted to her.
						They did everything that was humanly possible for her care and comfort. She was never left alone
						or lonely. She was always loved and needed; it was a distinct pleasure to have our trusted
						mother. God allowed us the blessings and happiness of enjoying and keeping Mother at home
						without the sorrow of seeing her bedfast or suffering great, intolerable pain. As a wife, Mother
						worked very hard beside Dad, helping guiding, sharing in rearing a family and making many
						sacrifices. She worked diligently at all of her varied and different tasks and never once voiced
						a complaint. She was a perfectionist in all of her endeavors and all of her pursuits were a
						labor of love. As a friend, Mother was always very warm, patient, and understanding. In return,
						she was blessed with loyal friends. As a sister, she was a best friend, someone to confide in,
						depend on, and discuss any problem. She would cheer and comfort you. As a grandmother, she had
						this special love and thoughtful way and the grandchildren were drawn to her. She always gave
						encouragement and understanding. It has been so wonderful to have Mother to love. Mother has
						been and will always be a very special part of our lives. We have felt and will always feel a
						world of love for her. God blessed us with many wonderful things, but the finest of these is
						Mother. We pray that God above will guard and bless Mother with the grace of His wondrous love.
						Mother reflects God's love, and we shared this love, guidance and care. Lord, help us through
						this separation until we meet Mother. We are so lonely, sad and discouraged. Mother, we are
						leaving you in the hands of the Almighty with confidence. We will love you always, pray for you
						always, and I know God will pour out the blessings. God knows those who are His and will keep
						you in perfect peace. The honorary pallbearers will be brothers: Kennie Wireman, Homer Wireman,
						Ollie Wireman and Willard Wireman, and pallbearers are grandsons, Jerry Lee Arnett, Gary Ames
						Arnett, Doyle Arnet, Keith Brent, Bruce Whitaker and Don Ladd. We love you, Mother, your
						children</p>

					<p><strong>NATHAN CARROLL [Photo Not Available]</strong> With love and by the help of our Almighty
						God, we will write the obituary of our beloved Daddy, Nathan Carroll. He was born November 21,
						1907 unto Nathaniel and Mary Francis Carroll. During his life he met and married our loving
						mother, Delphia Hall. Unto this union were born eight children: two sons, Reevis and Eugene
						Carroll of Grethel; six daughters, Syrvelvia Sparks, Irene Sparks, and Mary Hall of Grethel,
						Earvina Adkins of Galveston, Treva Collins of Honaker, and Evelee Slaughter of Freemont, Ohio.
						Daddy had been blessed to live and see thirty-five grandchildren, thirty-six

						to rest in the arms of Jesus: Flo Ellen Clark, Patty Gail Adkins, Rita Adkins, and George Hall,
						Jr.; also two of his great-grandchildren, Nicholas Clark and Veronica Clark, are waiting in
						Paradise to meet him. Daddy joined the Old Regular Baptist Church August 19, 1972 and lived a
						faith-filled life until his call from heaven came September S, 1987, making his stay here on
						earth seventy-nine years and ten months. We truly feel our earthly loss is heaven's gain. He
						loved to go to church and be with his Brothers and Sisters in Christ. He loved to hear preaching
						and singing. He loved singing God's praises. Daddy was a good man and well-loved by all his
						family and friends. We hate to let him go and leave us all, but we all know in our hearts he is
						in the best of hands-God Almighty. Written by his loving wife and family</p>

					<p><strong>CATHRYN MOORE [Photo Not Available]</strong> With the help of the Lord, I will try to
						write the obituary of a dear friend and sister in the Lord, Sister Cathryn Moore. In the home of
						Nanny Blankenship Moore and the late Monroe Moore, a daughter was born August 8, 1928 at Price,
						Kentucky. In later years Cathryn met and married Beverage Moore and was married for forty-two
						years, until death did part them. To this union were born six children, four sons and two
						daughters. Two of her sons preceded her in death at avery young age. Two sons and two daughters
						are left to mourn their loss: Phillip Moore of Price, Luca Moore, of Price, Vannessa Lynn Moore
						of Mc Dowell, and Beverley Bell of Fostoria, Ohio. She had seven precious grandchildren that she
						loved dearly. She is survived by: her mother; four brothers and three sisters: Hershell Moore of
						Buckingham, Kentucky, Roe Donald Moore of Minnie, Kentucky, Everett (Silas) Moore and Ray Alvin
						Moore of Price, Kentucky; her precious mother, Nannie Moore, her sister, Mertie Stumbo of Price,
						Ecie Moore of Hi Hat, Kentucky, and Hanna Hamilton of Paintsville, Kentucky. She was preceded in
						death by five brothers and her father, Monroe Moore, John David Moore and Wootsie Moore, all of
						Price, Kentucky; Able Moore of Indian Town, Florida, and Cecil Ezra and Richard, who died at a
						very young age. All through Sister Cathryn's life she went day and night helping those that were
						in need, whether it be sickness or a funeral, she was always there sitting by one's bedside or
						trying to comfort a broken heart. Sister Cathryn lived a happy life with her children and
						husband for many a year until afflictions of her body slowed her down and eventually made her
						bed-stricken. Sister Cathryn started calling on her Lord for forgiveness of her sins and one
						sweet day, God, in His great mercy, spoke peace to her sweet soul. She immediately called the
						brothers on February 27, 1987 to her home and told them what GREAT things the Lord had done for
						her. However, her sickness prevented her from being baptized, but we feel her crown will be just
						as bright as ours. She bore her afflictions with as much patience as ever I saw. Very seldom
						complaining, always asking someone to sing her some pretty songs and hold prayer. God called her
						home on her birthday, August 8, 1987, letting us keep her for fifty-nine precious years. As I
						try to close this obituary, I say to her husband and family, "Your precious mother will live
						again and I beg you, please get ready to meet her again, for some day she will rise again with a
						smile on her face that will last forever, throughout eternity." Written by one that loved her
						very much, Brother Gary Compton</p>

						21, 1930 to the late Kelly and Mollie Osborne. She left this life on December 9, 1986, making
						her stay on this earth fifty-six years, five months and eighteen days. She was a good person. We

						Johnson of Virgie, Kentucky; her son, Kenneth Johnson of Hendersonville, Tennessee, her
						daughters and sons-in-law, Sandra and Lloyd Kelly of Clinton, Michigan, Glendora and Tommy

						and Gloria Hunter of Geneve, Ohio, also James K. Osborne, Jr. of Virgie, and one brother who
						preceded her in death, Jerry F. Osborne of Virgie, who died in 1956. She also left eight
						grandchildren to mourn her: Gregory and Eric Kelly, Tracy and Melinda Johnson, Renee and Connie
						Phillips, and Kirk and Keith Justice. They will miss their grandmother, for she truly loved them
						all. We moved to Michigan in 1964 and she joined the Old Regular Baptist Church on January 3,
						1965, in Ypsilanti, Michigan. She was baptized by Brother Covis Tackett and Brother Conley
						Calhourn. Then, when we moved here she came back to Enterprise, where she was a loyal member.
						She had cancer and she suffered a lot but the good Lord thought she had suffered enough so he
						came and took her home with him but, also, took her away from us as easy as you could pray for,
						she passed away in her sleep, with all of us who loved her the most around her bed. We are truly
						grateful to the Lord for taking her in this Way. It was what she wanted. She used to feed all
						the birds in the neighborhood. At times there have been over a hundred birds in the yard at a
						time. I hope they won't forget the kind woman who took such good care of them. She really loved
						her birds. I shall never see a bird that I won't think of her. We all loved her very, very much
						and we, her family, will never forger her. Written by her baby daughter, Pam Justice </p>

					<p><strong>JOHN C. WICKER [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with a deep sense of loss and sadness

						is survived by his wife, Eva Hoover Wicker of Jeffersonville. A daughter, Gladys Lafferty, and
						four sons, Jim, Vinnon, and Aaron, all of Jeffersonville, and Ivory Wicker of Wurtland,
						Kentucky, also survive, along with several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. One daughter,
						Gretta Sue Wicker, preceded him in death in 1956. Dad always worked hard for his family. He
						joined the Old Regular Baptist Church some fifty-five years ago. He lived a good and full life.
						He always loved going to church and hearing the word of God preached. He had great respect for
						the church and his brothers and sisters of the church. He longed for some of the members to come
						and see him. It always made him feel good, when his friends came. I believe with all my heart
						Dad is at rest now. He was so humble and never complained. Dad, you have paid the price and are
						one of God's angels now. We all hope to be with you again some day. Sadly missed by, wife,

					<p><strong>IRELAND TACKITT [Photo Not Available]</strong> With much sadness, I will try to write an

						was the son of Taulby Tackitt and Louise Tackitt. His mother died when he was four years old.
						His father married Roxie Johnson Tackitt and to this union were born four children two of them
						preceded him in death. Three are left to mourn their loss: Elzie Tackitt of Virgie, Kentucky,
						Menie Caudill, Leagon, Kentucky, and Flossie Johnson of Andrues, Indiana. He leaves his wife,
						Dixie Tackitt and one son, Garland Tackitt. I know they would love to have him with them but he
						is resting from his labor according to what he told several of his elders, that he felt God
						forgave him of his sins and wanted to be baptized when he got out of the hospital. He was not
						baptized in the natural water, but we feel he got the water that came down from heaven that a
						man may drink of and never die, so to the rest of the family and kindred, if you have not made
						peace with God, I beg you, fall out with sin and open your hearts' door and let Jesus come in,
						He will be there to comfort you in time of trouble and when he calls his children home, we can

					<p><strong>DEBORAH ANN BENTLEY MILLER [Photo Not Available]</strong> with a sad and broken heart, I
						will try to write this obituary of my daughter. Debbie was born October 10, 1958, making her
						stay on earth twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days. She was married to Price
						Miller, Jr. She leaves to mourn their loss: her husband, her father and mother, Fonso and Goldie
						Bentley of Caney Creek, and Christy Bentley, of the home; three brothers, Gary Bentley of Betsy
						Lane and Gregory and Steven Bentley of the home, and one niece, Cassandra Carol Newsome of Caney
						Creek. Debbie gave her hand to the Lord on December 26, 1986 and told Eles Case her experience.
						She wanted him and Don Blake Little to baptize her. She wanted to be baptized before she left
						Pikeville Hospital, going to U. K. Hospital in Lexington, but didn't get to. It hurt her so bad
						because she didn't get to be baptized. She told me and her Aunt Christine in Lexington Hospital
						to tell Eles that as soon as she got back home, she wanted to be baptized. Debbie wasn't afraid
						of ..,.:.b, but the pain got so bad she could hardly bear it. After she gave her hand to the
						Lord she was so happy. She could hardly talk because of shortness of breath, but she wanted
						everyone to know the good news. She wanted everyone to know how much she loved them. She told us
						she had a better home to go to when she left this world. She said she saw Mamaw, Della Case,
						with her hands out, telling her to come on home and she said she saw the Lord. She would pray
						and ask the Lord to help ease her pains. Debbie was a friendly, likeable person. She was always
						laughing and talking to people. She talked right up 'til she died. She told me right before she
						died, "Mommy, I love you." She really suffered before she died, but I believe all her suffering
						is over. I believe she is at rest. She told me she wanted to be buried right beside her Mamaw,
						Della Case. The doctor said, when she died, she went like she was going off to sleep. I miss her
						so bad at times, that I can hardly bear it. She is missed around the home and missed by everyone
						that knew her. By the grace of the Lord, I will meet her in heaven some day. She was another

						friends. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church and took his membership to the Caney Creek
						Church, the church he loved, and lived there until his death. He was baptized by Elder Eles Case
						and Elder Monroe Jones. Daddy was sicker than they thought. He didn't want anyone to know of his
						sickness. He was a true and loving father to his family and friends. Daddy loved everybody. He
						loved for them to visit him. He was a retired miner and carpenter. Our hearts are broken, but we
						believe his suffering is over. I'll say to all the children, you can meet Daddy again. Fall out
						with sin and be born again. We can all meet him on the golden shore. We all believe in our
						hearts that Daddy's happy now, there will be no more pain and suffering, Daddy's with God. God
						was with you while you suffered. He knew that you'd had your share. He gently closed your eyes
						and took you in his care. Dear God, take this message to Dad up above. Tell him Mom and all of
						us miss him. To us, he was like a singing dove and, please God, give him all our love. Written

					<p><strong>LESTER AMBURGEY [Photo Not Available]</strong> By the help of the good Lord, I will try
						to write the obituary of Brother Lester Amburgey. Brother Lester was born February 22, 1921 in
						Knott County, Bath, Kentucky. He was born the son of the late Monroe Amburgey and Dicy Collins
						Amburgey. Brother Lester had heart problems for the last few years, and after much sickness, on
						April 24, 1987 about 8:30 a. m., God saw fit to take Brother Lester home where no sickness
						comes. He was sixty-six years, two months and two days old. On May 14, 1948 he married Georgia
						Collins. To this union were born six children. Left to mourn their loss are: his wife, three
						boys and two girls, all of Connersville, Indiana, where Brother Lester worked and raised his
						family: Lester Jr., Larry Wayne, Robert Allen, and Wilbur Joel, who drowned in 1974, Wanda Sue
						Kaiser, and Joyce Ann Evans; also eleven grandchildren and two step-giaiid_hildren, also of
						Connersville; three brothers, Haymond of College Corner, Ohio, Wiley of Litt Carr, Kentucky,
						Monroe, Jr. of Connersville, Indiana; two sisters, Verda Franklin of Mallie, Kentucky, Cindy
						Hammonds of Clarksville, Indiana; and many friends and loved ones. His parents, one son, one
						brother, and two sisters preceded him in death. On September 21, 1974, Brother Lester joined the
						Old Regular Baptist Church at Little Children's Home, and was baptized by Elder Roy Caudill and
						Elder Zee Holbrook. He was a good and faithful servant. He soon felt his calling to the ministry
						and he sure loved the old time way. His favorite songs were, 'How I Came to Love These Pilgrims'
						and `Two Coats. In 1979 Brother Lester felt the Lord wanted him to take his letter to the Little
						Bethel Church at Sligo, Ohio, where he was welcomed with much love and fellowship. Brother
						Lester loved all the churches and he would travel many miles to church even when he was not able
						to go, but when the Lord would bless him, he would always say, "I'm glad I went." Brother
						Lester, Sister Georgia and I went many places to church and had many happy times praising the
						good Lord and he enjoyed that so much. There is so much I could say about Brother Lester but,
						children, we feel he has gone where no sickness and sorrow can come, and by the grace of God, if
						you will look to the same God that Brother Lester looked to then, when Jesus comes we can all go
						home together. Written by Elder Zee Holbrook</p>

						him in death, and a little brother who died in infancy. He had one living sister named Oma
						Larry. Allard was a retired coal miner. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church November 2,
						1952. He was a minister for over twenty-one years. He was a true member, and filled his seat
						even when he wasn't able. He loved to read the Bible. I remember when we used to burn our old
						oil lamp. He would come in from work and read the Bible until ten or eleven o'clock at night. He
						believed in the Old Regular Baptist faith. He did not mix or mingle with anyone else. When he
						would get up to preach, I have heard him say, "I am going to preach what God gives me, if you
						never ask me to get up again." He also believed that the children of God have knowledge. The day
						he passed away he sang three of the prettiest songs I have ever heard him sing before. He was a
						light to his children. So, if you want to see Daddy again, you better fall out with sin and
						close in with the mercies of God. Today is the day of Salvation, children, remember, tomorrow
						may be too late. He was missed by many and loved by few. He was a true, loving husband and
						caring father. Daddy is gone, but his memory will always be with us. There are many good things
						we could write about him, but time nor space won't permit. We would like to say that people
						would call from far and near for him to pray for them. They did not want to wake him up, but he
						would tell them to call anytime and he would pray for them. We miss him more and more every day.
						Allard's memorial will be preached at the home, the second Saturday and Sunday in June 1988 and

						daughters, Norma Jean, Jacqualene, Rosalee, Millie, and Geneva Christene; she also leaves
						fifteen grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, at the time of her death, and a host of
						relatives and friends. Mommy suffered a great amount of sickness during the last twenty-five
						years of her life. She was diabetic, had hypertension, heart disease, and poor vision, which was
						caused by the diabetes. She bore her illness quietly and never did a lot of complaining because
						of it. Oh, she would complain because she didn't feel well, but never once did she question the
						wisdom of God because she was ill. She was a very warm-hearted person who loved every one of her
						children and friends and neighbors. Even when she was very sick, she loved to listen to and sing
						the hyms that Christians everywhere sing. She was critically ill several times during the last
						ten years of her life, but the Great Creator of all things chose to leave the lovely flower in
						the garden for a time longer for her family and friends to love and adore. Mommy never joined
						Church, but she lived her life precisely the same as the other Christian people we knew. She
						dressed in the same manner, fixed her hair the same, and even in her conversation, it was
						evident that she was truly an instrument of the Great and Almighty God, because of the way she
						taught us and lived her life before us. During the last year of her life, she knew in her heart
						that she wasn't long for this world, and according to what she told our cousin, Leroy, and our
						brother, Ishmael, Jr., we firmly believe she is now in the Lord's beautiful garden. The day and
						evening preceding her death she seemed to be feeling much better and very happy. It was as if
						she sensed that the Lord was ready to call her home. She died a peaceful and non-painful death,
						other than what she had suffered down through her journey of life. Mommy, We all love you very
						much and miss you terribly, but deep within our hearts we believe that ,you are in a better
						place now, that is free from all heartaches and pain. We hated to give you up, but we are also
						glad you won't have to suffer anymore. So sleep on, Mommy, 'til Jesus comes for you. Children,
						if you want to see Mommy again, to Jesus. He is the doorway to heaven. Written by her loving

					<p><strong>GENERAL LEE SLONE [Photo Not Available]</strong> This is the obituary of my beloved
						husband, General Lee Slone. He was born November 10, 1925 and passed away January 5, 1987,
						making his life here on earth sixty-one years, one month and twenty-six days. General Lee and I
						went to school together when we were children and later on, as teen-agers, we fell in love and
						were married July 7, 1945. We had fortyone and a half years together, and with much happiness
						and love we had nine children that we love more than life itself; Ruby Phyllis Collins of
						Leburn, Kentucky, Jeff Manis Slone, Betty Sue Mays, Jimmy Defon Slone, Brenda Carol Collins,
						Phillip Lee Slone, and Ronald Dean Slone, all of Hollybush, Kentucky, Bobby Darrell Slone of
						Lexington, Kentucky, and Billy Ray Slone, who ,receded him in death in 1958. Also preceding him
						in death are two halfbrothers, Randolph Slone and Billy Marcum Clark, father, Manis Slone, and
						step-father, Bill Clark. General Lee leaves to mourn his death, his wife, Jeanette, his mother,
						Lola Clark, eight children, eleven grandchildren, three sons-in-law, four daughters-in-law, one
						half-sister, Geraldine Jacobs, two half-brothers, Archie Slone and Marvin Slone, and many
						friends. General Lee worked very hard to raise our children. He worked for many years drilling
						gas wells, and ran a sawmill as long as he was able to. In 1978 he had a bad heart attack and
						later had two more. In 1985 he had a stroke and never was well anymore. He was so sick. I said,
						"Baby, ask God for help." He said, "Net, I have been praying for a long time." He told one of
						our daughters-in-law he didn't dread to die because he was "alright" with God, and I feel that
						our loss is God's gain for I never knew a person as good and kind as he. He was so good to me
						and our children. My home and heart are so empty and lonely. I miss him so much. General Lee
						helped the Hollybush Church to get the land the lunchroom and parking lot are on. He always had
						the best interests of the church at heart. Although he didn't attach himself to any church, I
						feel he was right with God and with the help of God, I hope to see him again. I have lost the
						best friend I ever had. Sleep on, my darling. We will always love you. Written by your poor

						Appalachian Regional Hospital, McDowell, Kentucky. Robert was born May 27, 1914 at Hi Hat, in
						Floyd County, Kentucky, making his stay here on earth seventy-two years, five months and two
						days. Robert was a retired coal miner and a member of Union Local 5889 of the United Mine

						furnish things for his family. Often tears would come to his eyes as he listened to the old
						songs of Zion, as sung by brothers and sisters when they came to the hospital and his home to
						visit. After Robert was taken to the hospital, and upon a visit by Elder Ellis Holbrook,
						Moderator of the Joppa Church at Melvin, Kentucky, Robert told Elder Holbrook that he had been
						praying for a long time and he felt that God had forgiven him of his sins. He requested to be
						baptized and received as a member into the Joppa Church. Surviving Robert's death are: wife,
						Dorthula Stanley of Bevinsville, Kentucky; five children, Loretta Lucas of Wabash, Indiana,
						Eulavene Conley of Wabash, Janet Crawford of Hi Hat, Kentucky, Cora Lou Stanley, who preceded

						and twenty-one years in the mines, his health started to fail. He suffered from black lung and
						other lung diseases. He was in and out of the hospital for months before he died. On Christmas
						Day in 1984, they lost James for a short period of time. He had stopped breathing. They worked
						with him for a while and he started breathing again. When he could talk again, he told the
						family he was mad that they had brought him back, that he had seen heaven and he told them how
						beautiful it was. He said he believed the Lord had saved his soul and he had a better home to go
						to. We could hear him praying to his Lord at night. James suffered so much, only the good Lord
						knows how much he really did suffer. The night and day before he died he was as humble as a
						child. I feel James' suffering was for a reason. We all miss him deeply and hope to meet him in

					<p><strong>RUTHA NEWSOME [Photo Not Available]</strong> By the help of the Lord, I will try to write
						an obituary of my loving and precious mother, Rutha Newsome. Mom was the daughter of Elder J. W.
						and Vina Hamilton. Mom was born April 9, 1908, making her stay on earth seventyeight years and
						twelve days. Mom met and married Dad, Daniel Newsome, August 10, 1935 and the Lord blessed them

						leaving to mourn the loss of one so dear to me are: Shirley May Hamilton, her only daughter, and
						two grandchildren, whom she loved as her own, Gary Hamilton and Jeanetta Bryant; and two
						great-grandchildren, whom she loved very much, Shirley Marie and Jason Daniel. Mom was sadly
						missed by everyone who knew her. After Dad passed away, Mom went to Michigan and made her home
						with me and my husband, Eugene Hamilton. Mom was a hard-working woman throughout her life. She
						always had her doors open to feed the church people. She was good to everyone. Mom had a smile
						for everyone. Oh, how we miss her. We hated to see her go, but the Lord knows best-He needed
						another rose in his garden. Mom didn't belong to the church, but she bore the fruit of a
						Christian. I feel and believe Mom and bad are at rest together where they won't have to part
						anymore. I want to say her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I know you miss Grandma so
						much, but try and meet her in Heaven someday, where you won't have to part anymore. I want to
						say to my husband, Eugene, who was so good to Mom and cared for her, I won't ever forget it and
						I hope someday we both will meet Mom and Dad in the sweet by and by, where we all won't have to
						part anymore. Oh, how lonesome, Mom, it is here without you but I know you are much better off.
						You suffered so much in this old world. Mom had three sisters to mourn the loss of one so dear'
						Alice, Lizzie, and Margie; four brothers: Christopher, Kenis, Clifford and Elijah; and three
						stepchildren: Mary Alice, Susan and Chester. Mom had a smile for everyone. My home is so
						lonesome without Mom. I want to say to Gary and Jeanette, don't ever forget the good counsel

						things about Mom, but her life has proven what a good woman she was. I loved and cared for Mom
						so much, but I feel I will be with her and Dad some day, where we will be happy in that Heavenly

					<p><strong>DORMANT COFFEY</strong> It is surely with a heavy heart that I undertake this requested
						task of writing the obituary of such a dear brother and friend. Brother Dormant Coffey was the
						son of the late Columbus and Margaret Wireman Coffey of Magoffin County, Kentucky. He was
						blessed with a journey of seventy-seven years. Early in life he chose a life-long companion,
						Margaret Hale, who shared life's pleasures and sorrows. This union was blessed with four
						wonderful children and suffered the loss of one son. Brother Dormant is survived by his wife,
						Margaret, a son, Arnold of Ray, Ohio, and two daughters, Marjorie Brooks of Glen Roy, Ohio and
						Mildred Ross of Ray, Ohio. He is also survived by three brothers and four sisters: Liberty of
						Ray, Ohio, Curt of Jackson, Winford of North Fairfield, Ohio, Rebecca Moore of Jackson, Ohio,
						Susie Shepherd of Shiloh, Ohio, Bertha Phips of Greenwich, Ohio, and Edith Owsley of McArthur,
						Ohio. He is also survived by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He was preceded in
						death by a son, three brothers and three sisters. After a rewarding seventy-seven years, God
						spoke to our beloved brother and said, "Lay down your cross, welcome home." Brother Dormant was
						a wonderful deacon and was faithful to that office to the end. He was more than willing to help
						in all of the associations he visited. His passing was so quick, the full impact will not be
						realized until the associations meet. He worked hard at his profession, as well. He drilled gas
						wells for England Gas Co. for about twelve years. They moved to Ohio in 1951 where he worked for
						the B & O Railroad and operated his farm until retirement. Brother Dormant just went away with
						the greatest friend of mankind, Jesus. His body was laid to rest until God unites them forever
						where there is no cancer or sting of death and no victory for a cruel grave. Elder Paris C.

					<p><strong>GRANT NEWSOME [Photo Not Available]</strong> With the help of the Lord and my family I

						was born January 1, 1922 to Rebecca and Charlie Newsome at their home at Beaver, Kentucky. He
						has two brothers, Estill of Beaver and Tommy of Ligon, and one sister, Maudie Hamilton of
						Michigan, also survive. Grant was called away from us suddenly Monday July 13, 1987 in the early
						morning and left us all with sorrow-filled hearts. Grant met and married Goldie Hamilton
						September 8, 1942, and to this union were born four sons: Grant, Jr. of Hi Hat, Kentucky, Donnie
						of Dema, Kentucky, Stony of Hi Hat, and Bobby Dale of Price, Kentucky. Eight grandchildren also
						survive and two preceded him in death. His grandchildren loved their Paw-paw dearly and they
						were indeed precious in his eyes. Grant was a coal miner for thirty years and was a member of
						Local of Wheelwright, Kentucky. Grant was stricken with a stroke in September of 1984, which
						limited his ability to travel and trade with people as he had done for years. This, I think,
						hurt him as much as the pain he suffered. Although he never joined any church and was baptized,
						he often sent for the preacher to come and talk and sing for him. I hope during his hours of

					<p><strong>PAY HAMILTON [Photo Not Available]</strong> On February 26, 1924 Tandy and Zellie
						Hamilton were blessed with a son, Pay Hamilton, that would lead a wonderful life, and leave a
						great story that should be told. Daddy spent his childhood in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky.
						In April 1943, he enlisted into the United States Army, and served his country during World War
						11. In 1951, Daddy met and married Dorthy Vance, who would eventually give him nine children.
						For us children, words cannot express the love and appreciation we have for him. He was a good
						father and a wonderful grandfather. Dad worked hard all of his life and as most of us knew,
						there was never a time, no matter how he felt, if one of his kids, our spouses, grandkids or a
						friend needed his help for any reason, they could count on him to be there. If he had a dollar
						for every favor he did for people, he could have lived in a mansion lined with gold. He was
						proud of his work and his family. He worked about twenty years in the coal mines and several
						years as a carpenter. Many times working one day and the other at night to see that his family
						was proveded for. Dad worked hard and made a great sacrifice in his life to care for his family
						and keep us close together. Having nine grown and healthy children proves that his work here had
						been well rewarded. His home was always open to anyone in need, whether it be advice, comfort,
						food or a place to sleep. It brightened his life to be able to help anyone in any way. Dad left
						this world suddenly on August 29, 1987. He was preceded in death by both parents, Tandy and Zell
						Hamilton and an older brother, Arville Hamilton. He is survived by one younger brother, Ray

					<p><strong>THOMAS TACKETT, JR. [Photo Not Available]</strong> With sad hearts and many loving

						Junior, as he was called by family, was born January 1, 1922 to the late Thomas Tackett and
						Fannie Hall Tackett of Beaver, Kentucky. He had eight brothers, four who are deceased: Green
						Tackett, Andy Jack Tackett, Willie Tackett and Amos Tackett, of Beaver, Kentucky. He had four
						surviving brothers: Hatler Tackett, George Tackett, Clifford Tackett of Beaver, Kentucky, and

						Barbara Tackett Caudill, Carolyn Tackett Newsome of Beaver, Kentucky, Lacy Tackett Teems and
						Mary Belle Tackett Hall of Ellijay, Georgia, and one deceased, Wanda Mae Tackett. Thomas married
						Sterle Tackett of Beaver, Kentucky and to this union were born seven children: Delores Tackett,
						Jettie Marie Tackett, Danny Tackett, of Columbus, Ohio, Larry Tackett and Jimmy Tackett of
						Grethel, Kentucky, and two children who preceded him in death. He is also survived by five
						grandchildren. Thomas was a kind-hearted and loving man who, by the grace of our Lord, lived a
						full life of sixty-four years. Thomas was a very dedicated and loving father who raised his
						children with plenty of love. He made those close to him feel special and loved because it was
						his nature. Thomas talked to his family about the Lord, how the Lord had forgiven him his sins

					<p><strong>EDNA ALLEN [Photo Not Available]</strong> With much love and many precious memories, I

						and passed away on January 22, 1987. her stay on earth was sixty-four years, ten months and
						twenty-nine days. She was the daughter of the late John and Kate Allen Adkins. Mom married Dad,

					<p><strong>DOUGLAS DWAYNE HAMILTON [Photo Not Available]</strong> It is with the happiest and most
						precious memories imaginable that we write this obituary of our baby, Douglas Dwayne Hamilton.
						Doug was born December 20, 1964, the baby of our family, he died July 24, 1987. God blessed us
						twenty-two years, seven months and four days to have him, here on earth with us. He is survived
						by his parents, Elder Hershell and Alberta Hamilton of Beaver, Kentucky; two brothers, Dan
						Hamilton of Lexington, Kentucky and Eddie Hamilton of Hi Hat, Kentucky, two sisters, Janet Vance
						and Brenda Howell, both of Hi Hat, Kentucky. Doug's brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, nieces,
						aunts, uncles, cousins and all his friends were so close to him. He was an easy person to love
						because of his eagerness to love others. Being the baby of the family he was so special to us,
						and we all let him know every day how much we loved him and that he was the center of our
						attention. He was always so jolly and happy. He had an accident July 22, 1987 on an
						all-terrain-vehicle, and died fifty hours later. We find our comfort in knowing that he lived
						long enough to pray. We find comfort in Acts, Chapter II, Verse 17-18. The visions and
						revelations shown to our family and friends have been a great help to us through the deepest
						sorrow ever put upon us. The morning before Doug died, my oldest daughter, Janet, dreamed of
						being in a beautiful green valley, walking in a sparkling steam and in the far distance a white
						horse appeared coming toward her. The nearer the horse came, the slower it got. The horse was
						carrying our baby on it's back. We believe it was the white horse that carried Doug to heaven to
						live with God until we can be with him. She also dreamed of seeing Doug as a little boy the
						morning before. Two days after my son's funeral, I prayed for a witness from heaven that my baby
						was safe at home with Jesus. I dreamed of living in old Brother John B. Hamilton's store
						building with my wife and children. I began to scold my baby and he was afraid I was going to
						whip him. He told me if I was going to whip him that he was going to live with John B. I felt a
						great burden lifted after this dream and I prayed day and night for the Lord to show my family
						where Doug was so that their burdens would be lightened. A few days later on September 1, 1987
						my youngest daughter, Brenda, dreamed of being on a cloud. When the fog lifted she could see
						tall build ings. She saw the most beautiful city that you could ever imagine. She said a voice
						spoke and told her that Doug was there and she then asked if he could come back. The voice told
						her that he didn't want to come back, because he was happier than he had ever been in his life.
						She asked again to go see him and was told that it was not time for her to go to the city. We
						all felt the greatest satisfaction and happiness after Brenda saw this beautiful city where Doug
						lives today. To have the flower of our family taken away in the midst of his youth is sometimes
						more than we can bear. Without the strength of God we could not go on. Doug's absence leaves a
						sadness beyond imagining unless you have been through such sorrow. The hope that Doug left us
						keeps us safely on the journey to be with him someday. Written by Dad, Mom and children</p>

						too. I pray that we will be together again someday. I want to thank all who helped out during
						the time of sorrow. He was a hard worker. He worked in the coal mines nine years, drove a coal
						truck thirty-seven years and had been retired two years and eight months. He had his heart

					<p><strong>CANTON JACOBS [Photo Not Available]</strong> With many loving, precious memories, we

						December 11, 1986. Daddy was preceded in death by our dear mother, Hattie Huff Jacobs, who died

						their grandfather. His four sisters and two brothers are also left to mourn his passing: Mary,
						Lillie, Bloomie, and Delia; Travis and Columbus. During the seventy-eight years of life our
						daddy had here on earth he made many friends. He worked as a carpenter during his early life to
						raise his eleven children. After retiring as a carpenter, he began working at his sawmill, above
						his house on Caney Creek, at which he worked until his death. Through this work Daddy made many
						acquaintances. People relied on his advice and knowledge for many things. Daddy believed in
						treating everyone fair and just and he strived each day to do just that. The well-being of his
						neighbor was just as much concern for him as th a well-being of his own children. Every time you
						entered his house, his first concern was "Are you hungry or thirsty?" Although our daddy and
						grandpa never attached himself to any one church, we feel through his works and faithful
						attendance to church he has been laid to rest silently. His son, Gayland, would like to say, "My
						sisters and brothers, not only sisters and brothers, but every sinner. The ones who don't know
						the Lord, I beg you harder from the bottom of my heart, Repent and Jesus will do the rest. If
						Dad could speak back to you his words would be, "Put your light on the candlestick." John 3_16:

						was always a kind and loving father and husband. He sacrificed much so his family could have it
						better than he had. He worked in the coal mines for forty-five years until he became disabled in
						1975 with black lung. Everyone knew him as an honest, hard-working, humble man. He requested
						that the brothers and sisters come to his home November 1, 1986. After singing some good old
						songs of Zion and holding prayer, he offered his hand to become a member of the Little Salem Old
						Regular Baptist Church. He told the brothers he felt the Lord had forgiven him. After hearing
						his experience, a move and second was made to receive him in full love and fellowship when
						baptized. Although he never lived to be baptized in the water, we feel he received the baptism
						of the Fire and the Holy Ghost which is required for the salvation of the soul. Daddy's
						suffering is over now and we believe he has gone to reap his reward in a land where no pain or
						sorrow can ever come. If any of us ever expect to meet him again, we must put all nature aside
						and come willingly for the Lord Jesus Christ to take control of our lives. Written by the family

					<p><strong>CHRISTOPHER CORTNEY NICKLES</strong> In loving memory of our sweet grandson, I'll try to

						N. Nickles while they were serving in the army in Alaska. He departed this life December 19,
						1986. He is survived by his father, Thomas N., and his mother, Katrina Branson, his step-mother,
						Rose Marie Adams, a beloved brother, Richard Thomas Nickles, and an adopted brother, Danny
						Adams, two adopted sisters, Angel and Trasie Adams. He is survived by grandparents, Mr. and Mrs.
						Nickles and Mr. and Mrs. Staple. We all loved him so dearly. He had cancer of the brain. It was
						operated on, but it didn't do any good. The cancer stopped for a while, then took a new start.
						The doctors at McDonalds Hospital in Texas asked Chris if there was a wish he'd like to have
						before he went to the Lord. He said, "Yes, I want to go to Alaska to see where I was born." So,
						the army let all his family go with him. After he got back, he got bedfast, but when they told
						him and showed him where his little body was going to be, he would turn his little eyes toward
						heaven and say, "Oh, I'll be so happy when I can go." He was a good child and was so good
						through all his sickness. He never grumbled about anything. Every time I would call them on the
						phone, Chris would speak, I would say "How are you, Honey?" He'd say, "I'm fine." I woulds say
						"Mammaw and Pappaw Nickles loves you." He would say, "I love you and Pappaw, too, Mammaw." I
						know he is in God's flower garden just waiting to be picked, and with the help of the good Lord;
						this Mamaw will meet him, and I'm like he was, Oh, I'll be so happy when I can go. Written by

						He was married to Shirley Mae Hamilton Reynolds on October 12, 1946. He raised my younger
						sister, Vicky Lynn Hamil ton Bryant as his own daughter. He also took in my sister, Magdalene
						Hamilton DeVillez as a young girl and sent her through school. He always called them his
						daughters. All the children who knew him called him Poppy because all children loved him very
						much as he did them. He always made people he came in contact with feel welcome, no matter if
						they were young or old or somewhere in between. He was always good to people who were in need of
						any kind of help. He was always giving something of himself to anyone who was in need of
						something. He was especially good to all children. He was a merchant for twenty-eight years and
						at the time of his death he was the owner of S & J Market, Beaver, Kentucky. He was elected to
						the State House of Representatives from the 95th district of Floyd County and served in that
						office from 1970 to 1972. The day before he passed away he was so happy and was singing hymns.
						Tim had been in poor health for years, but he would try never to let this slow him down and his

						1987 at the John Randolf Hospital in Hopewell Virginia, making her stay here on earth eighty
						years, eight months and twenty-six days. Early in life she met and married Earl Caudill, and to

						Jasper and Dester Caudill. Those still living are, Lester Lee Caudill and Pal Mira Caudill, both
						of Hopewell, Virginia, and Allard Caudill of Chester, Virginia. Sister Minnie gave up her
						companion in death April 13, 1977. Brother Earl and Sister Minnie saw the need of a saviour many
						years ago and they sought the good Lord with all their heart, until they felt that sweet peace
						come into their souls that only God can give. Thank the Lord for that sweet message, "I'll Never
						Turn A Praying Heart Away." Brother Earl and Sister Minnie gave their hands to become a member
						of this old visible kingdom, the old church, many,many years ago, to wit, the Little Powell
						Church of Old Regular Baptist at Eubank, Kentucky, which is now the Rose of Sharon Church of Old
						Regular Baptist. After they had belonged to this old church for a time, the church felt a need
						for deacons, and the church felt Brother Earl and Sister Minnie filled the qualifications for
						deacons. The Bible tells us like this, `Let them first be proven." So, the old church felt they
						bore the fruits and he was ordained a deacon. The sister gets her power through her husband, to
						be a deaconess.&nbsp; In later life, Brother Earl and Sister Minnie moved to Hopewell, Virginia,
						as all their family lived there. They filled their seats at church as often as they could. They
						were faithful unto death. Sister Minnie leaves to mourn her passing, three children, seven
						grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren. I want to say this to the family, Mom and Grandma
						left a great light for you to follow. Also, to the friends, if you want to go where Sister
						Minnnie has gone you will have to make ready to go. Repentance is required at the hand of
						everyone of you nothing less than a new birth in Christ will do. You can have your name enrolled
						on every church book here on earth, and if it's not enrolled on the "Lambs Book of Life" let me
						ask you how is He going to call your name in the last day? If you become born again by the Holy
						Spirit, the Lord writes your name on the Lambs Book of Life and no man is able to erase it. Some
						sweet day He is going to call you out of this troublesome world into a world of happiness, to be
						with the Lord forever and forever. Bless the good Lord. Written by the Lord's unworthy servant,

						morning, in Jesus Christ we trust. We feel that if Loretta could talk to you she would say,
						husband, dear, repent and get forgivemess before it's everlasting too late. The same to all my
						kindred and friends and loved ones. There's one more thing I'd like to say, I'd like for you to
						hear, don't let my daughter go astray, for her, I pray, take care. Written for her husband,

					<p><strong>OMA LOU KINNEY</strong> It is with much weakness and sadness that we will try to write
						the obituary of Oma Lou Kinney, sixtyeight years of age. She was born in Virginia, October 1,
						1918, the daughter of the late John C, and Emma Bartley. She deceased this life at 7:30 p. m.
						Tuesday, June 30, 1987, at her residence. She was preceded in death by her husband, Frank
						Kinney, who died in the year of 1980. She is survived by two daughters, Susie Elswick of
						Jacksonville, Florida and Lois Ann Wooten of Lookout, Kentucky; one brother, J. C. Bartley of
						Huber Heights, Ohio; one sister, Mable Whicker of Lookout, Kentucky and one half-sister, Ola
						Boaz of Williamson, West Virginia; also five grandchildren and one great-grandchild Thank God
						for the good memories of Mother, and there is no one on earth who can ever replace her. The good
						memories will live on in our life even though we will miss Mom, but God knew what was best for
						her. God has always had a purpose for the sometimes forgotten Mothers all down through the ages
						of time. We read in the Bible of the life of some of the old sainted mothers who had a great
						bearing on the bringing to pass the plan of God. So, the word Mother has a much broader meaning
						to us because a Mother's love is one of the sweet memories death can't destroy. No doubt the
						days have been very lonely for her since Dad left. God gives us our family to enjoy our lives
						together here in this world, but God wants us to repent and be born with God's love and his
						Spirit, so we can join another family, which will last not only through this life, but will last
						through eternity when our natural life has ended here on earth. Even though we have to be parted
						from our Mother and Father in this life, when we choose the good part, that shall never be taken
						away from us, by praying to God and letting Him save our souls with an everlasting salvation,
						then we have a Father and Mother that will never leave us. God, our Father, and Mother
						Jerusalem, our Mother who will take care of us through this life and when this life is over,
						will make sure we get home safely and won't it be a joyful time when all the family of God is
						joined together to part no more in a place where we won't be saddened anymore and God will wipe
						all tears away, where Joy and Peace reigns forever and forever. God bless each one in this
						family and may the love of God draw each one close together and most of all, that love can draw
						you to the One that can save, keep and take you to a place where only love exists. As we take
						the parting hand and each one goes their separate ways, perhaps for some maybe to meet no more
						here on earth, be ready and we can meet again over in that heavenly land where we will all be
						satisfied. God bless you all. Written by the family and Elder Donald B. Little</p>

					<p><strong>MAUD FRANKLIN</strong> With God's help, I will try to write the obituary of my dear and
						old friend and Sister in the church, Maude Franklin, Sister Maud, as we called her, was born
						February 14, 1904 and died September 21, 1986. She was eighty-two years old at the time of her
						death. She was the daughter of the late Jim and Rosa Priest Hampton. She is survived by one son,
						Chester Goble, of San Antonio, Texas. She has one brother and one sister, deceased, Tom Hampton
						and Allie Hale of Williamson, West Virginia. She was a member of the Little Nancy Old Regular
						Baptist Church of Price, Kentucky. We didn't get to attend her funeral on account of sickness.
						We will miss her in this life, especially when we come over for the New Salem Association, as we
						always did and stayed with her. She was always good to us. I hope and pray to meet her again
						someday in Heaven where we won't have to part in death anymore. A friend and Sister in Christ,
						Sister Nellie Jarrell</p>
