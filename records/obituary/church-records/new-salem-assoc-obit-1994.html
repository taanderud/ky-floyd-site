					<p>WILLIE MADDEN: With a saddened heart, I will try to write the obituary of my late husband, Elder
						Willie Madden. He was born in the home of Dock and Susie (Middleton) Madden in Dizney, Ky on October
						7, 1914. He passed away at the Medical Center of Southern Indiana on December 15, 1993. He was 79
						years 2 months and 8 days old. He married Bessie Cloud in March of 1932 to this..... union were born
						three children Jacqueline, Shirley, and Don all of Otisco, Indiana. He also raised two grandchildren
						as his own. Sandra (Janey), who preceded him in death at age 15. Samantha (Michelle) James who resides
						in Otisco, Ind. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church in 1939. He was ordained June 27, 1942, in
						the Pilgrim Rest Church in the Indian Bottom Association. At the time of his death Willie \had been a
						faithful member for 54 years. Willie's whole life was surrounded with our Lord Jesus Christ. He went
						far and near across mountains to preach the gospel to the lost and dyiny world. He preached a.....
						strong doctrine throughout his years. His preaching made imprints on many people across the land. Many
						people to this day recall this man preaching years and years ago in Kentucky. Pepole can recall the
						sermons he preached. He is remembered as a strong man true to his belief of the church. Even in his
						last days in this world he made imprints on the people around him. The doctors, nurses, and especially
						his family. With the help of the Lord we... were able to keep him at home, the last year he was bed-
						ridden. The hospital had nurses and assistants who came to help with him. His children also gave help
						with him the last year. We will all remember his last words telling us "I want to go home." We know he
						is at rest with Jesus. We all miss him dearly and still shed tears, but we know he is where he wanted
						to be and in a much better place than.... this old world. We hope to be with him some day. Willie
						belonged to the Indian Bottom Association until 1970. During this time he server as moderator of
						Hurricane Gap and Mallet Kork. He served as assistant moderator ae Whitesburg. In 1952 he moved to
						Indiana. He continued to travel around the country preaching the gospel. He also served as moderator
						at Long Valley in Indiana. In 1970 he went into the New Salem Assoc- iation. At the time of his death
						he was the moderator of the Little Daniel Church in Otisco, Indiana. His health failed him the last
						few years he was with us, but he remained strong in his faith and doctrine. He continued to believe in
						a clean church. He was able to go to church until his last two years with us. The last year he was not
						even able to read his bible. He talked of the church and going home up until the day before his death.
						There were times when I believe he was reliving church meetings. On December 15, with his daughter
						Jacqueline and granddaughter Michelle, by his side, he passed away from this old world to a better
						place to be. The most peaceful look came over his tired face. You could feel the Lord's presence in
						the hospital room that day, he went on to be with Jesus. He will be remembered by all as a man of his
						faith that stood tall and erect for his Lord. He will be remem- bered by his family as "Pa" a man as
						plain as the over- alls he wore and a man as strong as the gospel he.... preached. Sleep on my beloved
						until the last day when Jesus comes in the cloud of his glory. Together in his redeemed home. Written
						by: his wife and companion of 61 years Bessie Madden</p>
