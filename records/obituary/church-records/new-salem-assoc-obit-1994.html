						sons and one daughter. Three sons died in infancy. They also adopted a grandson and reared him

						approximately 60 years and he was a coal miner for 36 years. Dad joined Pilgrim's Rest Church on
						March 9, 1957 and was baptized March 10, 1957 by Elders Troy Nichols and... Woodrow Dye. He was
						ordained as a minister March 12, 1962. He served as both moderator and assistant moderator of

						his life to provide a living for his family. He gave freely to the church and those in need. Dad
						was strict on us, but we never went cold or hungry and we knew he loved us and wanted all of us
						to prepared to meet our Lord. He built a firm foundation for us in our youth, one that any child
						of God could be proud of and I believe with all of my heart that Dad will be in that first
						resurrection. My parents were my best friendsand the best role models I've ever seen. I shall
						miss them deeply but I hope to meet them in Glory. May God Bless each and everyone of you. We
						shall all miss Dad, but I believe his troubles are all over. My love goes with you , Dad
						throughout all of Eternity. Written by: his daughter Carolyn.</p>
					<p>WILLIE MADDEN: With a saddened heart, I will try to write the obituary of my late husband, Elder
						Willie Madden. He was born in the home of Dock and Susie (Middleton) Madden in Dizney, Ky on
						October 7, 1914. He passed away at the Medical Center of Southern Indiana on December 15, 1993.
						He was 79 years 2 months and 8 days old. He married Bessie Cloud in March of 1932 to this.....
						union were born three children Jacqueline, Shirley, and Don all of Otisco, Indiana. He also
						raised two grandchildren as his own. Sandra (Janey), who preceded him in death at age 15.
						Samantha (Michelle) James who resides in Otisco, Ind. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church
						in 1939. He was ordained June 27, 1942, in the Pilgrim Rest Church in the Indian Bottom
						Association. At the time of his death Willie \had been a faithful member for 54 years. Willie's
						whole life was surrounded with our Lord Jesus Christ. He went far and near across mountains to
						preach the gospel to the lost and dyiny world. He preached a..... strong doctrine throughout his
						years. His preaching made imprints on many people across the land. Many people to this day
						recall this man preaching years and years ago in Kentucky. Pepole can recall the sermons he
						preached. He is remembered as a strong man true to his belief of the church. Even in his last
						days in this world he made imprints on the people around him. The doctors, nurses, and
						especially his family. With the help of the Lord we... were able to keep him at home, the last
						year he was bed- ridden. The hospital had nurses and assistants who came to help with him. His
						children also gave help with him the last year. We will all remember his last words telling us
						"I want to go home." We know he is at rest with Jesus. We all miss him dearly and still shed
						tears, but we know he is where he wanted to be and in a much better place than.... this old
						world. We hope to be with him some day. Willie belonged to the Indian Bottom Association until
						1970. During this time he server as moderator of Hurricane Gap and Mallet Kork. He served as
						assistant moderator ae Whitesburg. In 1952 he moved to Indiana. He continued to travel around
						the country preaching the gospel. He also served as moderator at Long Valley in Indiana. In 1970
						he went into the New Salem Assoc- iation. At the time of his death he was the moderator of the
						Little Daniel Church in Otisco, Indiana. His health failed him the last few years he was with
						us, but he remained strong in his faith and doctrine. He continued to believe in a clean church.
						He was able to go to church until his last two years with us. The last year he was not even able
						to read his bible. He talked of the church and going home up until the day before his death.
						There were times when I believe he was reliving church meetings. On December 15, with his
						daughter Jacqueline and granddaughter Michelle, by his side, he passed away from this old world
						to a better place to be. The most peaceful look came over his tired face. You could feel the
						Lord's presence in the hospital room that day, he went on to be with Jesus. He will be
						remembered by all as a man of his faith that stood tall and erect for his Lord. He will be
						remem- bered by his family as "Pa" a man as plain as the over- alls he wore and a man as strong
						as the gospel he.... preached. Sleep on my beloved until the last day when Jesus comes in the
						cloud of his glory. Together in his redeemed home. Written by: his wife and companion of 61
						years Bessie Madden</p>
