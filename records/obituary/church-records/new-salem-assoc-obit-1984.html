                    <p><strong>CARRIE DRAUGHN SLONE</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethern, concerning them which are
                        asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope." I Thess. 4:13. When we think of
                        death, we think of sorrow, as those without hope. Sleep in death, one can't be troubled, when
                        you sleep. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister Carrie, an aunt of mine, by marriage, was born to the late
                        Kell and Jane Johnson Draughn on August 26,1892, being 91 years old, when the death angel call
                        her Home on December 7, 1983. She was married to David Fair Slone November 29, 1909 of Raven,
                        Kentucky, in Knott County. She is survived by three sons, Delzie of Jeffersonville, Ind., Roy
                        Slone of LaGrange, Ohio and Ernest Slone of Dayton. Ohio. Five daughters, Lora Dobson and Mae
                        Gibson of Raven, and Ruie Sturgell of Titusville, Florida. Twin daughters, Allie Gibson of
                        Marion Ohio and Ollie Terry of LaGrange, Ohio. Two brothers, Troy and Leslie Draughn, one sister
                        Rettie Watts of Garner, Kentucky. Two children died in infancy, two sons, Merrit Slone of
                        LaGrange, Ohio and Clemon Slone of Raven, and one daughter Elsie Moore proceeded her in death.
                        She was blessed to have 32 grandchildren. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aunt Carrie joined the Caney Fork
                        Regular Baptist Church at Raven, Kentucky in Knott, County the third Sunday in May 1920. She was
                        baptized by Elders Lindsey Mosley and her father-in-law, Morgan Slone. She loved children, her
                        first concern was to offer them food, or anyone else when they visited her. I have many fond
                        memories of her, during my childhood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her delight was in the Lord, tho, she
                        wasn't able to attend church always, she was dedicated to read "what saith the Word of God". As
                        the years passed on, she lost her hearing to a great degree, but you never had to worry about
                        it, when you visited her. She had so much to tell you, about the goodness of the Lord, and how
                        she loved Him, you would never be lost for words, all you needed to do was just listen. You
                        would leave with your Faith re-newed, you wouldn't be with her very long until her conversation
                        was about the Lord. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How precious to know that the God who is with us in this
                        life, is with us in death, how precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His Saints.
                        Psm. 116:15. A hope in Christ is something real, for He is our hope. Paul speaks of this hope as
                        something real and confident. A confident expectation that to be absent from the body, is to
                        present with the Lord. He has claimed victory over death for us. The person, who has no hope in
                        death, has no hope in life either. Death brings immediate sorrow, but that gives way to Eternal
                        Joy in the very presence of God! James describes death as the body without the Spirit, What a
                        blessing for the Chrisitan who dies with the expectation of being present with the Lord!
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those who do not know Jesus Christ, as your personal Savior, in Aunt
                        Carrie's family, my prayers are that you will be washed by His precious-eternal blood, being
                        born again, that Heven will be your home, when this life is over. May God bless Lora, who worked
                        and labored, careing so faithfully for her mother. The family wishes to thank all members and
                        friends of the Caney Fork Church, where she was a member. Also, her name is on the list at the
                        Pleasant View Church at Litchfield, Ohio where her daughter Ollie is a member. That is held each
                        year in June. God Bless you all. A niece, by marriage, A sister in Christ, Marjorie Slone

                    <p><strong>HATTIE BRADLEY</strong> By the help of the good Lord, I will try to write the obituary of
                        my dear wife, Hattie Bradley, who passed away and left me on June 12, 1984. Hattie Bradley was

                        faithful member until she passed away. We have labored and journeyed together for 58 years while
                        she was on this earth and have seen many sorrows and heart aches, but God blessed us on earth
                        with a long life. I believe that while her passing away brought me sorrow, it brought her joy.
                        Some sweet day we will meet again, not as of man and wife but as the angels around the throne of
                        God, where peace and joy abounds forever. I want to say to our children and grandchildren that
                        when they say good-bye, if they die in their sins that I feel it will be forever. Written by her

                    <p><strong>BELLE MOORE</strong> It is with sadness and sorrow that I will try to write the obituary
                        of our dear beloved mother, Belle Moore. She was the daughter of the late Von and Nancy Moore of
                        McDowell, Kentucky. She was born December 15, 1905, at Dema, in Knott County and passed away
                        September 9, 1983 at her home in Willowick, Ohio. She married Hawk Moore, son of Albert and Emma
                        Stumbo Moore on May 3, 1928. To this union was born six children. A daughter, Lois Jean,
                        preceded her in death on July 2, 1937; also her husband, Hawk, preceded her in death on October
                        12, 1952. Left to mourn her loss are one son, Paul Dean Moore, of Mentor on-the lake, Ohio; four
                        daughters: Loraine Robinson of Newton Falls, Ohio; Anita Robinson of Willowick, Ohio; Lola
                        Velotta of Willowick, Ohio and Rexene Caudill of Wayland, Kentucky. Two brothers: Alvin Moore of
                        McDowell, Kentucky; Arthur Moore of Louisa, Kentucky; one brother, Orbin Moore, of McDowell,
                        Kentucky, passed away on May 8, 1984. Mom had fifteen grandchildren and ten great grandchildren
                        who loved her dearly. Mom became a member of the Steel's Creek Regular Baptist Church on April
                        4, 1954, where she was a faithful member for 29 years. Although Mom had been a resident of Ohio
                        since 1957, she looked forward to coming back home to go to church as long as she was able. The
                        last few years of her life, she didn't get to come very often because of ill health, but her
                        heart was here. Mom would listen to the tapes that I had taped for her in church and she would
                        get such joy listening to the singing and preaching. Mom was loved by everyone that knew her,
                        friends, neighbors, relation and her brothers and sisters in the Lord. One of the happiest days
                        of my life was when I got down on my knees to wash my mother's feet and she washed mine. It will
                        soon be a year since our Mom passed away but it seems like only yesterday. She was our guiding
                        light and she always taught us right from wrong. We thank God for the precious memories we have
                        of her. She is happy now in her new home, where there is no more pain or death, just peace and
                        joy forever more, in that beautiful land called Heaven. I hope and pray we will all see our Mom
                        again. Written by her daughter, Rexene Caudill</p>

                    <p><strong>MOLLIE HAMILTON MOORE</strong> With the help of my Lord, I will write an obituary of my
                        loving motherin-law, Mollie Hamilton Moore. She was the daughter of Joe and Nannie Akers
                        Hamilton. She was born January 8th, 1894 and passed away on July 22, 1984, making her stay here
                        on earth 90 years, 6 months and 14 days. She was married to Grover C. Moore and to this union
                        were 12 children born of which 8 preceded her in death, Astor, Ezra, Azzie Moore, Nannie Burke,
                        Sophia Akers, Isabell Reynolds, Zella Ricker and Betty Jean Moore. Four daughters left to mourn
                        her passing are Emma Pack, Esta Blanton, Kathryn Tennant and Darlene Landrum. Mollie joined the
                        Little Rosa Regular Baptist Church in 1948 and loved to fill her seat when she was able. Mollie
                        had 31 grandchildren who loved little granny, as Mollie was called this by them. She will be
                        missed very much but our loss is Heaven's gain. So to those of us who remain, we must get ready
                        to meet Mollie in the beautiful land where she is now resting. Written by her daughter-in-law,

                    <p><strong>MARY VINA MAE TACKETT</strong> By request of the family and by the help of the Lord, I
                        will try in my weakness to write an obituary of Mary Vina Mae Tackett. Mary was born September
                        26, 1964. The daughter of Brother Denver and Sister Lula Tackett of Halo, Kentucky and died
                        November 22, 1983 making her stay on earth 19 years, 1 month and 26 days. Leaving to mourn her
                        passing are her father and mother, 3 brothers, Scott, Amos and David all of Halo, Kentucky, 2
                        sisters, Lucille Gayheart of Halo and Betty Cook of Buckingham, Kentucky. She also leaves many
                        relatives and friends. So I say to all that read this obituary, the young are dying as well as
                        the old. We have no promise of tomorrow. My advice to the young people is this, as the Lord
                        said, "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God and their is none
                        else." The Lord also said, "I even I, am the Lord, and besides me, there is no Savior." So
                        Brother Denver and Sister Lula I know your heart has been made sad again in this world. I'm glad
                        the Lord said, " In this world you shall have trouble but in me you may find peace." But God is
                        so good. He gave His only begotten Son that who so ever believeth in Him should not perish, but
                        have everlasting life. On the night of her accident, she appeared to me in a dream. The most
                        beautiful robe I ever saw, she asked me to go with her. I told her I couldn't at that time but
                        she said she would be back again. I say to her brothers and sisters, I believe by God's great
                        mercy, that God heard her cries and I believe someday I will meet her. So may God bless, Elder
                        Jerry Hall</p>

                        Virgie Tackett Hamilton quietly slipped away. Making her stay here on earth 94 years, 10 months,
                        and 19 days. She was born in Pike County Kentucky on February 16, 1889, the daughter of the late
                        James and Mary Ann Martin Tackett. She was married on December 1, 1904 to D. Emit Hamilton of
                        Floyd County Kentucky. Unto this union were born eleven children, five of which preceded her in
                        death. Her husband also preceded her in death on March 11, 1947, leaving six children, thirty
                        grand children, forty-six great grandchildren, sixteen great great grandchildren and one sister,
                        Gracie Little of Pikeville, Kentucky, to mourn her loss. ' Surviving children include three sons
                        Noah Hamilton, Michigan City, Indiana, Foster Hamilton, Alexandria, Ohio, Elmer Hamilton,
                        Kettering, Ohio; and three daughters, Stella Howell, New Carlisle, Ohio, Draxie H. Newsome,
                        Ligon, Kentucky and Margie Parsons, McDowell, Kentucky with whom she made her home. Children
                        preceding her in death include one daughter Maxie Hamilton, April 1, 1926, and four sons Arvil

                        Charlie Hamilton, February 28, 1980. She had been a member of the Regular Baptist Church for 77
                        years actively attending for as long as she was physically able. Although she had been bedfast
                        for most of the past 10 years, she never stopped begging the Lord to let her live just a little
                        longer. Many, many nights she woke me singing, praying, or shouting. So many times she said she
                        had no earthly treasures to leave but she a mansion when she died that gold and silver could
                        never buy. Mom's suffering and lonely hours are over now. She is at rest forever with the Lord.
                        We feel our loss here is Heaven's gain. Her body was laid to rest January 6, 1984, on the Lucy

                    <p><strong>BILL BRANHAM</strong> With the help of the good Lord, I will try to write the obituary of
                        my most precious Dad. Dad was born to Jack and Sarah Branham, August 10, 1897, making his stay
                        on earth 87 years, 1 month and 1 day. Dad first married Malvy Pack who preceded him in death. To
                        this union was born 2 sons. He later married Dolly Case Branham and to this union was born 10
                        children - 3 baby daughters preceded Dad in death. Left to mourn his loss is Mom, who Dad cared
                        and treasured for 57 years, six sons and three daughters - Elzie Branham of Largo, Indiana;
                        Johnny Branham of Dinwiddy, Virginia; Carlos Branham of Williard, Ohio; Malcom and Donald of
                        Plymouth, Ohio; Ronnie Branham of Mansfield, Ohio; Arcolas Goble and Hazel Chaffins of Willard,
                        Ohio; and Addie Langley of Henderson, Kentucky. Dad has 6 brothers who all preceded him in death
                        except for 1 - Ross Branham of Paintsville, Kentucky. Dad was blessed to have 29 grandchildren
                        and 22 great grandchildren. Dad joined the Old Regular Baptist Church about 55 years ago. He was
                        ordained as a deacon at the Little Dove Church in Honaker, Kentucky the 4th Saturday in June,
                        1935. He brought his letter to the Little Rebecca Church when he came to this part of the
                        country to live 25 years ago. Dad was a faithful member and filled his seat as long as he could
                        and even sometimes when he was not able. I feel the church will miss him greatly. Dad loved the
                        old time way - he loved order in the church and he stood firm on what he felt and believed was
                        the old time way and would keep order in the church. He hated to see new things come in that
                        would change that. I was blessed for the past 3 months to have Dad in my home with the help of
                        my sister Arcolas and a daughter-in-law to Dad, Gracie, who was so precious to him - he loved
                        her like his own daughter.&nbsp; I have many precious memories of Dad - I will miss Dad calling
                        for me, but there is going to be a call in that morning when the trumpet sounds that Dad and I
                        will answer together. 1 feel and believe that we'll board that cloud and go home together. To
                        the children, the grandchildren, the great grandchildren and friends - you can see Dad again if
                        you want to but first you must lay down the sinful things of this world, repent and be born
                        again - then you will be made a fit subject for Heaven. I feel our loss is Heaven's gain.

                        my loving father, Johnie Bryant. He was born at Feds, Kentucky on July 27, 1905 to the late
                        Sidney and Mary Bryant. He departed this life on May 1, 1983, making his stay here on earth 77
                        years, 9 months, and 1 day. On July 26, 1924 he was married to Lissie Bryant to whom he was
                        married for 59 years. To this union was born fourteen children, eight preceding him in death.
                        Left to mourn his loss is his wife, four sons, two daughters, eighteen grandchildren, and seven
                        great grandchildren. Dad was sick most of the time in the last couple of years, but he never
                        complained. He had a strong will to live for he loved life. As long as I can remember Dad had
                        went to church. He loved to go to church even when he wasn't able. Dad never joined the church,
                        but I feel with all my heart that Dad is in Heaven. While he was in the hospital the last time,
                        he told a minister that he had a better home to go to. I and many others miss him greatly, but I
                        feel he is not suffering any more and is in a land of happiness. Written by his loving daughter,

                    <p><strong>FRANCES BRYANT HONAKER ISSACS</strong> In loving memory and heart felt thanks, I will try
                        to write this obituary to pay tribute to my darling mother. Frances Bryant was born June 9th,
                        1909 to Sidney Bryant and Mary Akers Bryant who both preceeded her in death. Mom went home to
                        her heavenly Father January 11th, 1983 making her visit here on earth 73 years, 7 months and two
                        days. Mom was married to John P. Honaker in June of 1942, and to this union was born her only
                        child, Mary E. Honaker Bryant of Norwalk, Ohio with whom she had lived for the past few years.
                        After Dad died in February of 1951, Mom married the Elder Jonah Issacs who also proceeded her in
                        death. Mom gave her life over to the Lord when she was only 19 years of age. Mom was a charter
                        member of the Little Nancy church at Hi Hat, Kentucky. Mom lived a true and faithful life to the
                        very end. Mom loved going to church and seeing her brothers and sisters and had gone to church
                        the week-end before she died. I will regret as long as I live that I was not with her at church
                        that last time. I was told by my cousins how happy she was that Sunday, and how she shouted all
                        over the church house. Mom was as happy and faithful serving God seven days a week as she was on
                        Sunday. I well remember when I was a very small child how she would wake Dad and me with her
                        shouting and praising God. The Sunday evening before Mom died she told me as she had so many
                        times before, Mary I am ready to die and I am not afraid, so please don't worry about me just
                        get yourself ready to meet me in Heaven some day. When I found her dead in bed on that Tuesday
                        morning, she was so peaceful looking that everyone including the nurse and policeman that came
                        when we called the ambulance, said "They had never seen anyone die so peaceful in all their
                        years on duty". I knew that she had just gone home to be with her Heavenly Father, whom she had
                        served so many years. My mother never had a lot of money to leave me, but she left me the
                        greatest gift a mother could leave her child. That is the gift of teaching me they way to
                        eternal life through Jesus Christ, whom she served every day of her life. I only wish I had
                        taken this gift and used it wisely before she died. I know that would have made her happier then
                        any gift that I bought her. I can never live the spotless life my mother lived, but I pray that
                        someday by the grace and forgiveness of God that I may be able to see her again. Mom leaves to
                        mourn her loss, one daughter, Mary Bryant of Norwalk, Ohio. Two grandsons Carl Hamilton, of
                        Ipswich, England, and Stephen Hamilton of California, one granddaughter Rosemary Cooper of Green
                        Springs, Ohio. Three great granddaughters, two great grandsons and was preceeded in death by one
                        grandson. She also leaves one sister Pearlie Adams of Frankfort, Kentucky and one brother H. L.
                        Bryant of Martin, Kentucky. Mom told me so many times, "Mary, please don't worry about me when I
                        am gone, I will be walking those streets of purest gold, just repent and join me there so our
                        family can be together again. I will never get over the loss of my mother, but I thank God for
                        sharing her with me for 39 years. Written by her grateful daughter, Mary Ellen Bryant</p>

                        write an obituary of my husband, Andy Gibson, better known as "Son". He was the first born son
                        of Ben and Peggy Caudill Gibson, and was born May 8, 1918 and died June 1, 1984 after a long
                        illness. He has four sisters living, Nancy Hall, Josie Slone, Nebraska Mullins, and Neola Meade,
                        seven sisters deceased, Alice, Susanna, Florency, Clercia, Virsie and twin infant sisters,
                        Virdee and Virnie. He has two brothers living, Leonard and Daniel, and four brothers deceased,
                        Bill, Miles, Maynard and Sylvester. Son was a good husband, son, son-in-law, brother, uncle and
                        a true friend to so many. He was always a hard worker, and could be depended on to lend a
                        helping hand whenever he was needed. He wasn't able to attend Church like he wanted because of
                        severe caugh- ing spasms. Like his father before him he believed in the Old Regular Baptist. In
                        the summer of 1981 he was seriously ill at the V.A. Hospital in Lexington. The doctors did not
                        think he would live. He told me then that, however, God wanted it, he would be satisfied. He
                        came home and it was God's will that he live three more years for which I'll always be thankful
                        for. We were blessed to have thrity seven years together. Precious memories mean so much, and my
                        hope is that my husband is at peace with our blessed Lord. I pray we will meet again some sweet
                        day. I, his brothers, sisters, neices, nephews, in-laws and friends will always love and miss

                        But I didn't give up, I yelled for my neighbor who came in to see what was wrong. My neighbor
                        Mr. Fields said, "Mrs. Langley he is gone". Raymond doesn't have any sisters, brothers, mother
                        or father living. He was the last member of his family. He has several nieces, nephews and
                        cousins. We raised our children by digging for support, but we raised 3 good, children. They are
                        nice and kind to everyone old and young. So pray for them and me. We need all your prayers. We
                        also have 8 grandchildren. They are Cindy, Matthew, and Scott Langley. Bobbie, Renee, and Mark
                        Caudill. Anetta and Jimmy Langley. We have 1 great granddaughter, Lee D. McDaniels. Written by,

                        heart that I try to write the obituary of my loving and beloved mother. She was born August 4,
                        1925; in Floyd County Kentucky. She was the daughter of the last J. S. Bryant and Nancy Davis
                        Bryant, Mother passed away Friday, July 6, 1984, in Kings Daughters Hospital at Ashland,
                        Kentucky of a sudden illness. Her stay here on this earth was 58 years, 11 months, and 6 days.
                        Mother met and married Homer Bentley Sr. on July 26, 1940, who preceded her in death on July 26,
                        1982. Into this union was born 3 sons Enoch Bentley of Ashland, Kentucky, Billy Bentley of South
                        Point, Ohio and Homer Bentley Jr. of South Shore, Kentucky and 12 grandchildren. She leaves her
                        3 sons, 1 sister Mrs. Rilda Sipps of Ashland, Kentucky and 1 brother, Milford Bryant of Maytown,
                        Kentucky to mourn her death. Mom joined the Little Nancy Church and was baptized on Sunday,
                        August 28, 1983 by Elder Woodrow Dye and Elder Vernon Rose. Because of the distance to travel
                        she brought her letter to the Little Mary Church on Rt. 5 in Ashland, Kentucky. But she loved
                        and talked to me about going back to be with her brothers and sisters of the Little Nancy
                        Church. Mother you have and left us here so sad and alone. You and Dad are now together waiting
                        there for us to come. Dear Mother, I will meet you where no sorrow shades my brow. Oh how sad
                        when I remember that I have no Mother now. Written by, Her son, Billy R. Bentley</p>

                    <p><strong>SUSIE SLONE</strong> Susie Slone, the daughter of John Wesley and Mary McKinney Slone,
                        born September 7, 1889. She passed on to live with Jesus on January 30, 1984. She married Reuben
                        Slone on April 24, 1917 and to this union was born five children: two girls, Martha of Newport
                        News, Va., Mary Layne of Dema, Kentucky and three boys, Arvil who proceded her in death in 1970,
                        Ellis of Radford, Virginia and Calvin of Newport News, Virginia. Dad passed away in 1929 leaving
                        Mother with five small children to raise by herself. Mother joined the Old Regular Baptist
                        Church at Caney Fork in 1930 and was baptized by J. D. Mosley and Ellis Hopkins. She clung to
                        the Old Regular Baptist Faith, always reading the Minutes of the association and her Bible as
                        long as she lived . She always wanted to see that everybody had something to eat who came to see
                        her. I can say from my heart that Mother was sure a good Christian and a wonderful Mother to her
                        children. Surely a person as good as Mother was is with the angels around the throne of God.
                        Mother lived with me for 22 years but she is gone where there will be no more strokes or
                        heartaches for her anymore.&nbsp;</p>

                        It was such a shock. Aggie Reynolds Isaacs was born November 11, 1923 to Dock and Hattie
                        Reynolds. She was married to Earmel Isaacs and to this union was born ten children. Two preceded

                        neighbors who knew and loved her. Mom was a hard worker all her life. She worked so hard to
                        raise her children. And we always knew Mom loved us, and she was always there when we needed
                        her, but Jesus needed her more. I believe He has another Flower to his beautiful garden. Mom
                        never joined the church but she was a strong believer in the Regular Baptist. I believe she made
                        peace with our Lord before she left this earth. She spent a few days with me at Christmas, she
                        got up one morning so sad and unhappy, I asked her what was wrong. She had dreamed of climbing a
                        ladder, the higher she got the prettier it was, she awoke before she got to the top she wanted
                        to get higher. I told her, Mom someday you will make it to the top of the ladder. I believe with
                        all my heart she made the top, how beautiful it must have been. Someday when my Lord calls me
                        home, I will see my mother again. So sleep on Mom until that beautiful blessed day. Written by a

                        experience she had of being with Jesus and walking with him and holding hands on streets of pure
                        gold. That is why she is no longer with us here on earth, he needed a special angel for his home

                        August 27, 1958, at the age of 53 years, 6 months, and 14 days. He was the son of Alamander and
                        Elvina Tackitt, who preceded him in death several years ago. He leaves to mourn his passing his
                        loyal and devoted wife, Flossie Elswick Tackitt, who shared with him life's joy's and sorrows
                        for over 28 years; one son Ruben Lee Tackitt; and five daughters: Mrs. Opal Millman, and Orbenia

                        the railroad and in the mines. He was a devoted husband and father. Pike County has been made a
                        better place because he lived and labored there. The poet must have had in mind such a person as
                        Scott when he wrote the following lines which fit this wonderful father and husband so well:
                        Since this obituary was written 26 years ago, we will try to up date it. Since Daddy's death, he

                        Adams and Miss Rachel Tackitt to leave us and join him in Heaven. There have also been 8
                        grandchildren and six great grandchildren added to the family. Daddy, it has been a long time
                        since you left us, but you are still greatly missed. You are always in our minds and in our

                        memories we will attempt to write an obituary of our dear mother. To wit: Healtha (Hudson)
                        Holbrook. Mommy was born November 14, 1911 in Pike County, Kentucky and expired July 23, 1984 in
                        the Methodist Hospital at Pikeville, Kentucky after an extended illness. Mommy walked this life
                        on earth for 72 years, 8 months and 9 days. Mom was the daughter of Andy and Dillie (Tackett)
                        Hudson. She was united in marriage on June 12, 1929 to Noah Holbrook. To this truly happy couple
                        was born 5 children. 3 sons: Clifford Holbrook of Varney, Kentucky, George Holbrook of Bypro,
                        Kentucky and Sidney Lee Holbrook of Granger, Indiana, 2 daughters: Billie Joyce Williamson of
                        Varney, Kentucky and Jennifer Lynn Guenin of Nanjemey, Md. Daddy preceded Mommy in death on May
                        29, 1959 at his home on Long Fork. After that Mommy was never really happy. She is also survived
                        by 2 brothers: Sollie Hudson of Virgie, Kentucky and Sidney Hudson of Allen Park, Michigan, 2
                        sisters: Edna Burke of Virgie, Kentucky and Nora Dotson of Lincoln Park, Michigan. Mom has 16
                        grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren. Late in her life she married Jasper Belcher of Dorton,
                        Kentucky. In 1975 Mommy had a severe stroke. After rehabilitation and a lot of hard work, she
                        returned to her home on Long Fork. Only to fall and break her hip. She was unable to keep house
                        after that. She was confined to a wheelchair in her children's homes for the last 9 years of her
                        life. Mom joined the Old Regular Baptist Church in 1930 and was a faithful member until her
                        death. Her home was always open her table always set for Gods people. She was always ready to go
                        wherever Gods people met to worship. She would sing in that voice and shout "Glory Hallelujah"
                        when the Lord would open the window and pour in the blessing. It was truly a blessing to sit
                        with her in love and fellowship in the Enterprise Church where she had her membership. Her walks
                        and her talks have been a light to many people as she traveled on the Kings Highway. Her family
                        gives thanks to God for giving us such a fine Christian Mother. She fought a good fight, she
                        kept the faith and now she is waiting with Daddy for her crown. Mommy and Daddy's memorial will
                        be the 5th weekend in August 1985 at the Amil Little Cemetery on Long Fork of Virgie. Everyone

                        firm believer in the Regular Baptist faith and although he did not attach himself to the church,
                        there is no doubt in our mind or heart based on the testimony he gave several days prior to his
                        death indicating he had made peace with the Lord that his soul is resting under the alter of
                        God. His loving wife will always miss his presence and companionship and the children will miss
                        a loving and kind father. With his passing, we are left clinging to these words of the Psalmist
                        David, "He is gone from us and can no more come to us, but by the grace of God we can go to

                        years, 2 months and 20 days. She was married to Tilton Johnson on January 4, 1940. To this union
                        was born fourteen children. Seven which preceded her in death. Surviving children are; Othella

                        death are sixteen grandchildren. Also surviving her are two sisters; Gladys McKinney of

                        listen to The Old Regular Baptist preach and sing. She was good and kind to everyone and went
                        out of her way to keep down any trouble. A few days before she died she had a dream or vision,
                        she thought it was so real. She dreamed of playing with seven baby white doves and she and those
                        little doves all had a little puddle of clear water and played all day. I believe, that day will
                        be the Eternal Day for her and her seven babies. Ministers were: Ellis Holbrook, Monroe Jones,

                        himself to any church, but he told the family and friends that there was nothing in his way. God
                        adds to the Church daily, such as shall be saved. Therefore, we believe from his testimony that
                        his soul is at rest in the Paradise of God. To the family and friends, if you want to see Buster
                        again, (if you haven't already) make it right with God. May God bless all of you. Written by,

                        Knott County and died October 26, 1982, at the age of 64. He was the son of Joe Ward and Martha

                        neighbors. He didn't belong to any church; but from my many conversations with him, I know he
                        loved the Old Regular Baptist and the good old time preaching of the gospel. He loved to read
                        and discuss the Bible. Andy told the family he was a changed man and he told Grace he wanted to
                        join the Little Nancy Church and be baptized. We all loved him and miss him so much; but I
                        believe Andy is at rest with God. Written by, His son-in-law, David Chaff ins And his wife,

                        McPeek of Virgie, Kentucky; two grandchildren, one great grandchild, eight foster-grandchildren,

                        (Susie) Jennings both of Pennsylvania, and Mrs. Rhondina Hamilton of Robinson, Kentucky. An
                        ardent worker, Cordon had devoted his work life to the coal mines, first as an employee and then
                        as an employer undoubtedly enduring many hard-ships that go with this type of work. Cordon was
                        not a member of any church, however, he professed a hope in Christ and often attended the Old
                        Regular Baptist, the denomination he enjoyed most. Occasionally he and I would discuss the
                        scriptures and church affairs. A well content man, Cordon possessed characteristics which added
                        to his life's satisfaction. He was very strong mentally and physically, very calm, able to
                        ignore past errors and move forward, and had a thorough understanding and acceptance of life's
                        trials and expectations. I believe individuals lives are exemplified in their children and this
                        is one family I have observed for the past twenty-one years who have always corresponded much
                        better than the average family. They are not ashamed, bashful or backward when it come to
                        expressing their love and appreciation for each other. A man blessed with the ability to make
                        sound judgments, the ability to communicate well, Gordon would capture the admiration of people
                        with the enjoyable conversations one could have with him. Again, the ability to be wholly at
                        ease made him better able to get peoples attention and made him an enjoyable person to be
                        around. Gordon and Mollie left their home in Kentucky in 1966 to be with their children in
                        Michigan but I believe that perhaps God granted his request by taking him during his last visit
                        to Kentucky. We don't want to lose our loved ones and it takes time to recover, but, the
                        greatest feeling is believing they are resting in Paradise with Jesus and we the family don't
                        have any doubt about Gordon. Written by, His son-in-law and brother in hope, Elder Palmer R.

                    <p><strong>LULA RICHARDSON SHORT</strong> Our blessed mother was born June 27, 1908 and she left us
                        November 27, 1983, being 75 years old and a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church more than
                        40 years. Mom left behind four sons and one daughter who miss her very much: Paul and Pearlie,
                        Jr., of Pippa Passes; Charlie of Garner; Dewey, of Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Gertie Watson of
                        Martin. She had 14 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. Also, two brothers and four sisters
                        along with a host of friends and relatives remain who miss her very much. Although Mom was only
                        38 when our Dad, Pearlie Short, died, she never remarried. She had six children of her own and a
                        niece of Dad's, Grethel (Tootsie) to raise. Times were hard, but Mom did all she could and there
                        was always plenty of love. - Our Mother had been sick for some time, but was able to go until
                        about a month before she died. Mom told me and the boys many times that she was ready to go. The
                        last time she went into the hospital, she told us that she was going "Home" for she had dreamed
                        that our Daddy had come to the hospital, stood by her bed and told her that he had come to take
                        her back to Heaven. Many times she told us about this dream as she lay in the hospital. Then, on
                        Thanksgiving Day, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Lexington, she told us that she would not be here
                        much longer. The next day, my brother, Charlie and I were by her bedside, and she was holding
                        onto both of my hands praying for the Lord to take her "Home". As if in answer to her prayer,
                        the machinery suddenly stopped and her spirit was gone from us. Each time when Mom was sick, I
                        would pray, "Lord, let us keep her a little longer if it will be your blessed will." I knew that
                        I was being selfish; but I loved her so. He loved her even more. I know our loss is Heaven's
                        gain. One of Mom's favorite songs was "Just One Rose Will Do," and I feel that when God chose
                        our mother, He chose the biggest, most beautiful rose of all. We had you for 75 years and we
                        made enough memories for a lifetime. Memories of you are everyplace. Our hearts are sad because
                        we can no longer see your face, but we rejoice -in knowing that you are with Jesus and those
                        gone on before. Everyone who knew her loved our Mother, especially little children; some would
                        even call her "Mama Lula." She will be remembered for the love and kindness she shared with her
                        friends and family. There was always a quick, sweet smile on her face, a sparkle in her eye, a
                        crackle in her laughter, and love in her heart. No wonder we miss you so. Written by her

                    <p><strong>TROY SPARKMAN</strong> Brother Troy Sparkman was born March 1, 1900, and departed this
                        life February 27, 1984. He was the son of Billy Sparkman and Kathryn Jacobs Sparkman. Early in
                        life he was married to Ellie Slone and they had two sons and two daughters: Ishmal Sparkman,
                        Andy Sparkman, Francis Sparkman and Inis Jacobs. Brother Troy's companion passed away at a
                        fairly young age, and he was then married to Nannie Slone, and they had five sons and three
                        daughters: Billy B. Sparkman, George Sparkman, Harliss Sparkman, Sampie Sparkman, Vansel
                        Sparkman, Allie Jacobs, Vina Tuttle and Allyene Slone. Two sons, Andy and Billy B. and one
                        daughter, Francis had preceded Brother Troy in death. Other survivors include one brother, John
                        and one sister, Allie Bentley, 38 grandchildren and 21 great grandchildren with many other
                        relatives and friends. While still a young man, Bro. Troy felt the need for a saviour in his
                        life, and began to seek for a better home. In the year of 1933, he was baptized into the
                        fellowship of the Mount Olive church, and shortly after he professed a call to preach the gospel
                        of Christ. For more than forty years he was faithful to his calling. He traveled far and near,
                        walking over mountains and up the creeks and hollows. Wherever there was sickness or death, you
                        would find Brother Troy trying to help and comfort in any way he could. God had blessed Brother
                        Troy to live along and a full life in this world but the time finally came for him to depart,
                        but I trust his family will comfort themselves with the lifetime of good memories which he left
                        them. I believe that as the last breath left his body, there was a door opened in another world,
                        and he heard the singing of the angels. I believe that when the trumpet sounds he will get up
                        and go shouting down the golden streets of Heaven with all the redeemed of the King. Written by

                        Before Daddy died we would go to the hospital to see him and he would td l us what all the Lord

                        to his children and grandchildren, "Strive to meet him (Joe) on that bright sunny shore where

                        1916, the daughter of Sallie Akers Frasure and the late FL-die Frasure. She departed this life
                        on December 21, 1983. She was married to Freel Tackett on March 18, 1937. Unto this union was
                        born two daughters, Elma McKinney and Dora Lou Roberts, and one son, Donald Ray Tackett, all of
                        Grethel, Kentucky. She had seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren whom she loved very
                        much. Also remaining to mourn her loss are five brothers, Robert, Aderos, Noah, Eskil and Walter
                        Frasure; and three sisters, Rosa Ellis, Nellie Bush and Zella Minnehan, and a host of relatives
                        and friends. She was a member of the Pilgrim Home Church of the Old Regular Baptist for 28 years
                        and 8 months and was a faithful member until death. She attended church and visited the
                        hospitals, nursing homes and the homes of the sick many times when she wasn't able to go
                        herself, but she seemed to feel much better after having gone. Even when she was in the hospital
                        during her last days, she would ask for some of the minsters to come in and see her. She would
                        tell us that she felt so good after they visited her. The doctors had said she wasn't strong
                        enough to have visitors and had told us to keep everyone out except the immediate family, but we
                        knew how much she loved to be with her friends and brothers and sisters in the Lord, so we tried
                        with all our hearts to keep her comfortable, but still let her friends and loved-ones visit her.
                        She is missed so much around the home, church and neighborhood. Our place will never be the
                        same. It is very lonely without her but we feel our loss is Heaven's gain. Written by her

                        which died October 26 and Della Case, which died November 4, 1983. Sister America leaves her
                        husband, Mack Kidd, Jr., 1 daughter, Margrene Kidd Newsome, 1 son, Calip Lee Kidd, 3 sisters,
                        Mrs. Mae Case, Mrs. Masil Collins, Miss Alpha Damron, 6 grandchildren and a host of friends and
                        relatives to mourn her passing. Sister America joined the Little Dove Church of Jesus Christ of
                        Regular Baptist on July 25, 1952, and was baptized by Elder J. P. Hall. She was a christian over
                        31 years. I, Mack Kidd, Jr., being the clerk of that church now for 18 years and knowing my
                        companion's life, she was humble and obedient to christian virtues and would ask me to read the
                        Bible to her so she could be more able to teach her children and the young women how to live a
                        Christian life. She enjoyed going to church as long as she was able. She did not hesitate to
                        call the attention of others when she thought they were doing wrong. She would talk about Job
                        where he wrote man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. Also 19 chapter
                        and 25 verse, "For I know that my Redeemer liveth and that He shall stand at the latter day upon
                        the Earth, and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God,
                        whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another." Sister America said,
                        "I can say as the Apostle Paul said, I have finished my course, I have fought a good fight, I
                        have kept the Faith. There is a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
                        shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but to all them that love his appearing." If my
                        companion could speak back to us, I know what she would say. She would say, "Children my worries
                        are over and if you want to see your mother again you have to forsake all sin and repent and
                        live for Jesus Christ and meet me in Heaven on that Ressurection Day." While my companion was in
                        the hospital she was on a life support respirator with a tube in her throat so that made it
                        impossible for her to talk, but we would ask her something and she would nod her head. She knew
                        up until she was taken from us. Why I can say this is the day she died we went in and Calip
                        said," Mama, we are all here," and she noded yes. Then I asked for a kiss and she kissed me so I
                        know she knew us. When her friends and loved one would come to see her she would smile and reach
                        her hand. This obituary is getting long but I haven't said half of the good things about my
                        companion that could be said. This is from a song she always wanted to help me sing; Dear
                        friends, farewell, I do you tell since you and I must part, I go away and here you stay but
                        still we're joined in heart. Your love to me has been most free, your conversation sweet; how
                        can I bear to journey where with you I cannot meet. Oh, how much we all did love her, and did
                        all we could do, to try to keep her with us, for she we did not want to lose. But at the silent
                        hour, 4:22 p.m., December 16, 1983, with hearts so full of pain I saw my dear love one leave us.
                        While I was holding to her hand but with her we'll live again. God sent down a Holy Angel on
                        wings to bear her across the river home, we stood by so helpless while she left us here alone.
                        We followed her to the graveyard, with heads bent down so low, while in Heaven she's with Jesus
                        walking on the streets of Gold. Written by her broken-hearted husband and children, Mack Kidd,

                    <p><strong>JAMES MAYNARD</strong> By the request of Didema Maynard, I will try to wrte an obituary
                        of her beloved husband, James Maynard. He was born on September 22, 1901 and passed away
                        December 3, 1983 making his stay on earth 82 years two months and eleven days. He was the son of
                        the late Albert and Sarah Maynard. He first married Trexie Scott on May 29, 1923, unto this
                        union was born three children, one son and two daughters, his son and wife preceded him in
                        death. He later married Didema Harris Chaney on March 9, 1979. James and Didema lived three
                        years, nine months of happiness together. James was so good to her, he was so humble and good to
                        everyone, and was always ready to help anyone any way he could. He leaves to mourn his loss, two
                        daughters, Gracie Fields, Maxie Conley, his wife Didema, eight step-children, Matilda Chaney,
                        Belle Damron, Ima Elswick, Henry Chaney, Harvey Chaney, Clarence Chaney, Raymond Chaney and
                        eight grandchildren. James didn't belong to any church but he told his wife that he was alright
                        and I believe he was a good man the three years I knew him. If his children and step-children
                        ever want to see him again they will have to fall out with sin and make peace with their Lord. I
                        feel our loss is Heaven's gain. Written by, A friend of Goldie Newsome and His wife, Didema

                    <p><strong>GRACIE HARMON</strong> With much loneliness and aching heart I'll try with my Lord to
                        help steady my trembling hand to write the obituary of my dear Mother who departed this life,
                        March 1, 1984. She was born May 28, 1895. God blessed us children to keep her 88 years, 9 months
                        and 2 days. She was the daughter of the late Alfred Damron and Mary Kinney Damron. She was first
                        married the late Moody Elswick, they were blessed with two children Ada Trivette who survives
                        and Lean Elswick, deceased. On September 29, 1921 she married Thomas Jefferson Harmon deceased
                        this life August 6, 1972 and Verlin Jr. Harmon deceased March 30, 1931. The surviving children
                        are: Alma E. Tackett, Mae H. Wright, Eula Wright, Ruby H. Wright and Clifford Harmon. She had
                        five brothers, Belve Damron, Elisha Damron, Bona Damron, Wayne Damron and Fletcher Damron Three
                        sisters: Essie Elswick, Janie Damron and Dollie Adams all deceased. Mother was blessed with
                        twenty-four grandchildren and twenty-nine great grandchildren. She joined the Old Regular
                        Baptist Church August 1940, at Enterprise on Indian Creek where she was a faithful member 44
                        years. Mother become a wheelchair patient the last few years of her life. She spent the last 6
                        months with her daughters Mae & Ruby Wright, I would often go in where she was sitting and she
                        would be talking and no one would be in the room. She was talking to her Savior about her
                        children, she wanted them to be ready to go home. She knew her time was nearing, the morning God
                        called her when I went into her room she said honey the dawn is breaking. I feel with all my
                        heart she saw her future home. When the death angel took her from us I feel God was waiting on
                        the banks of Jordan to carry Mother across. Children Mother lift a bright light in the window
                        for us to follow her home. If we want to live with Mother forever we must follow Jesus, obey his
                        commandments all the way and be faithful until the end as Mother did. Yes, I miss Mother the
                        burden seems heavy to bear but when I remember how good God was to give me such a wonderful
                        Mother for all those many years and made it possible that I can go be with her forever I can't
                        help but shout and thank Him for saving such a little creature like me. Let me know the
                        sweetness of His son Jesus that Mother knew. She would often tell me about him coming and
                        staying with her when us children was smaller. She told me she had ate at the table with the
                        diciples after she got disabled to go to church. Clyde and I would go to church come back, stop
                        and I would cook dinner and visit, sometimes Mother would say when we come in I know you all had
                        a good meeting because I felt it, I had a good one at home. I will close by saying if you want
                        to see Mother again paick up the cross and follow Jesus so you won't have to cross Jordan alone.

                        months and 11 days. She was the daughter of the late Spurlock and Evaline Kidd Damron. Mom, was
                        married to Jack Case, who preceded her in death. Unto this union was born 14 children. Eight of
                        them precede her in death. Six of them is still living, 4 boys, Noah Case, of Esco, Freeman Case
                        of Dorton, Earl and Albert Case of Caney Creek. Two daughters, Goldie Bentley of Caney Creek and
                        Christine Belcher of Robinson Creek. She also leaves 29 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren.
                        She leaves 3 sisters, Masil Collins and Alpha Damron of Honaker, Kentucky and Stell Mae Case of
                        Caney Creek. 3 sisters and 1 brother precede her in death. Mom, belonged to the Caney Creek Old
                        Regular Baptist Church. She loved her church and filled her seat as long as she was able. After
                        she was bed fast, she always wanted her brothers and sisters to come out to her house and have
                        church for her. No one knows how Mom suffered unless they were around her. It hurt us children
                        so bad when she was in pain and we couldn't do anything else for her. We tried everything we
                        could and knew how to try to make the pain a little easier for her. The pain go so bad that she
                        begged the Good Lord to take her on home. We believed Mom is resting with Jesus today. She won't
                        have any more pain there. If there ever was a good woman on this earth, Mom was one of them. We
                        loved our Mom so much. Home isn't the same since she has gone. Mom, begged us children to get
                        right with the Lord, so we could meet her in Heaven. If she could speak back to us, she would
                        tell us, she wouldn't want to come back to this troubled world. To you Bood Brothers and
                        Sisters, she loved you all. We all miss her so much. Written by all her children</p>

                        obituary of a good neighbor and a humble Brother in the Lord, Grover Clinton McCown. He was born
                        February 19, 1928 to the late Sam and Stella McCown, being one of 10 children. G. C. had six
                        brothers, three preceeding him in death those remaining are: Earnest McCown of Caney Creek,
                        Billy Allan McCown of Hellier, Kentucky, R. E. McCown of Powells Creek and Virgil McCown of
                        Little Rock Arkansas. He had 2 sisters, one preceding him in death the remaining one is Ellene
                        Hunt, Phyllis, Kentucky. G. C. was married to Thelma Mercer July 31, 1948 and to this union was
                        born 8 children. Two sons, Terry McCown of Caney Creek and Grover Clinton Jr. of the home. Six
                        daughters, Ethel Mae Kiser, Caney Creek, Sharon Grace Chaffine, and Glema Louise Cox both of
                        Florida, Melinda Blair and Melissa Ann McCown both of the home and Pamela Little of Virgie,
                        Kentucky. G. C. and Thelma were blessed to see and enjoy 9 grandchildren. G. C. was struck ill
                        with cancer. He bore his sickness with patience and hope. He became concerned about his future
                        home and gave his hand to become a member of the Caney Creek Old Regular Baptist Church. He was
                        faithful to attend as long as his health permitted. Sister Thelma said about an hour before his
                        soul took its final flight, he began to smile so sweetly. We believe he saw that convoy of
                        angels coming to take him home. The Community and Church will feel the loss of a friend and
                        brother. His companion and children will feel the loss and loneliness in their heart for many
                        days. So as a church and community, lets pray that God will help them bear their burdens and
                        lighten the load. Trust in the Lord and repent and you too can go to a better Home where we feel
                        our brother is at rest. Written by the family and a brother in Hope, Bro. Logan Kiser</p>

                        mother, Lovina Newsome Hamilton was born March 1, 1898 and died May 2, 1984. God blessed her to
                        live on darth 86 years, 2 months and 2 days. She was the daughter of the late William and Mae
                        Tilda Newsome. She married the late Sol Hamilton in May of 1917. To this union was born ten
                        children, four sons, John L. Hamilton, William Hamilton, Sam Hamilton all of Caney Creek and Jay
                        Hamilton of Marshall, Michigan; six daughters, Mae Tackett, Opal Trout, Madeline Tackett all of
                        Caney Creek and Beulah Quinn of Ashcamp. Two daughters precede her in death, Melvina Newsom and
                        a baby Mae Tilda Hamilton. She has 23 grandchildren and 20 great grandchildren and two brothers
                        Osper Newsome of Dayton, Ohio and Christopher Newsome of Caney Creek; one sister, Goldie
                        Robinson of Caney Creek. We feel our loss of mother is Heavens gain. Mother joined the Old
                        Regular Baptist Church about 15 years ago and was baptized by Elder Sollie Kiser and Elder
                        Hatler Kiser. She was always a good humble woman. I remember in my childhood she would get up
                        during the night when the house would get cold and put cover over her children. She worried and
                        prayed for her children; she worried so much about her sons when they were in the army. Mother
                        was sick so many years. She bore her sickness with patience. Her children were all good to her.
                        We will miss her so much. We loved her so much. Now let me say to the ones that haven't fell out
                        with sin to repent and live for Jesus and meet mother in heaven some day and we will all live
                        together forever and forever. Written by her daughter and sister in hope Mae Tackett</p>

                    <p><strong>JONA KAY KISER</strong> I will try to write the obituary of our little girl, Jona Kay
                        Kiser, better known to all who knew her as Sissy. Sissy was born May 3, 1968 to Blake and
                        Margaret Kiser. Left to mourn her loss her parents, one brother, John Blake, her maternal
                        grandparents John B. and Ella Compton. Her paternal grandparents were the late Sollie and Lizzie
                        Jane Kiser. She leaves many aunts and uncles and cousins, she also leaves more friends than I
                        can count. Sissy attended school at Virgie and Dorton schools, where she was involved in many
                        school activities. She was so full of life and happiness, and a willingness to help and be
                        friends to everyone. God blessed us to keep Sissy 15 years; years that were joyous and happy.
                        She was, as all children are, a gift from God. I guess when God views his flower garden it is
                        more beautiful with buds as well as flowers. We feel that Sissy is a beautiful bud in that
                        bouquet. Our goal is to meet Sissy someday. Our children are the most precious joys in this life
                        and Sissy was like a ray of sunshine in our home. Somedays it feels like she should walk in the
                        door with her beautiful expression looking for us and there are days that feels like Sissy has
                        been gone for so long. Sissy lived more life and touched more peoples' hearts in her short life
                        than most people do who live to be old. The song "Precious Memories" has more meaning now than
                        ever before, because now every memory of Sissy is more precious than ever. All we have left of
                        Sissy is memories and I thank God for every memory we have. I pray that someday we canmeet Sissy
                        on that beautiful shore and see that happy face once again. Written by her broken hearted

                    <p><strong>KATE JOHNSON</strong> It is with much sadness that we attempt to write an obituary of our
                        beloved mother and grandmother who has gone home to glory to be with Jesus. Mother was born July
                        25, 1894, the daughter of W. D. Collier and Minerva Johnson Collier Little. She was married to
                        John B. Johnson on September 12, 1914 and to this union was born nine children. Six girls and
                        three boys. Five of whom precede her in death. Dad also precede her in death December 2, 1948.
                        She leaves to mourn her passing four daughters, Hazel Johnson and Lou Anderson of Southgate,
                        Michigan; Jessie M. Johnson who resided with her, and Helen Sue Burke of Melvin Kentucky, one

                        and in September 1948 she joined the Long Fork Church and was baptized by Elder Joe Jones. She
                        lived a true Christian life thereafter. She loved to go to church and went as long as she was
                        able to go, about the last five months of her life she was unable to go. She would have us call
                        the Elders to come and sing a song and hold prayer for her. Her favorite song was Amazing Grace.
                        She told us that she didn't want to be taken back to the hospital, and that she wanted her
                        family to take care of her, at home. We did everything in our power to make her last days on
                        earth as comfortable as we possibly could. Mom was blessed to live 89 years, 11 months, and 27
                        days here on earth. On July 22, 1984 about 3:40 a.m. she fell peacefully asleep in the arms of
                        Jesus. Our hopes now are of sharing that Eternal Home with her. Sadly missed by her Family that
                        loves and misses her very much.</p>

                    <p><strong>HARVEY TACKETT</strong> Harvey Tackett was born on October 22, 1908, on the Long Fork of
                        Shelby Creek in Pike County, Kentucky. He was the son of the late Willie and Mindy Tackett. He
                        departed this life June 1, 1984 at the home that he loved so much at the age of 75 years, 7
                        months and 9 days. He was married to Naomi Hudson, November 26, 1925. To this union was born 15
                        children. Six children precede him in death. The first two sons to die was Eugene, which he
                        always called "little Gene", and Martin Van Buren, whom he affectionately called "Brother Boy."
                        Bro. Harvey was like the old servant Jacob when he thought his son Joseph was dead. Jacob said,
                        "I'll go to my grave mourning the death of my son." These precious little boys was on Bro.
                        Harvey's mind in the last days and hours of his life. The Lord let him get a view of these
                        little boys as death drew near. What a comfort this must have been to him! His other babies died
                        as infants. In addition to his wife, Naomi, he is survived by three sons: Emzy Tackett of
                        Virgie, Kentucky, J.C. Tackett of Inkster, Michigan, Douglas Tackett of Virgie, Kentucky and 6
                        daughters: Lillie Hager of West Liberty, Kentucky, Ilma Miller of Xenia, Ohio, Betty Little of
                        Inkster, Michigan, Flora Brickey of Xenia, Ohio, Jackie Johnson of Myra, Kentucky, and Wilma
                        Hail of Virgie, Kentucky He is also survived by 29 grandchildren and 17 great grandchildren whom
                        he loved very much. He is survived by two brothers: Estil Tackett of Ohio and Orlando Tackett of
                        Michigan, and three sisters: Marie Carter of Pikeville, Kentucky, Lola Elswick of Michigan, and
                        Bertha Tackett of Virgie, Kentucky. He is also survived by many nieces, nephews and other
                        relatives and friends. He had such a winning manner about him. Bro. Harvey joined the Long Fork
                        Baptist Church the fourth Saturday in May, 1958, and after telling a wonderful experience of
                        grace he was baptized by Elder Mark Burke and Elder Jonah Tackett. From that day forward to up
                        build the Old Regular Baptist Church was uppermost in his mind. On the fourth Saturday in
                        December 1960 he was found qualified and worthy to be ordained as a deacon. He fulfilled his
                        charge as a deacon faithfully, courageously, everly striving for a clean church and the Old time
                        ways as it once was delivered to the saints. He came in the aim to establish The Pilgrim Hope
                        Church and devoted many, many hours of prayer and labor for its up build. One of the great joys
                        of his life was having his wife, 2 sons, 5 daughters and 4 son-in-laws to join with him in
                        serving the Lord. For the family that has not an experience of grace with the Lord, Daddy left
                        very plain footprints on the sands of time and his life as a light to show you the way. From the
                        day, Bro. Harvey felt that the Lord came into his heart he never once looked back or longed for
                        the things of the world but pressed forward in the service of the most high God, sometimes
                        through tears, pain, labor and heavy burdens. He was everly pressing toward that great meeting
                        with the Lord that he had last Friday morning at daybreak. As death drew near last week and he
                        was finishing up his earthly life, he seemed to try to tell Naomi and each child just once more
                        that he loved them. As he looked back over his life in those last hours the song Precious
                        Memories seemed to sum it all up. He asked Bro. Junior Damron to sing it for him. Bro. Harvey
                        said it sounded so pretty and good to him. Children, you know how Daddy wanted all you children
                        to be at home with him. Daddy said many times he was going home. Are you all going to strive to
                        meet Daddy there? Written by Elder Dewey Roberts</p>

                        write an obituary of our precious mother, Mae Newsom. Mom was born on November 27, 1911,
                        departed this life on August 27, 1984, making her stay on earth 72 years and 9 months. Mom was
                        the daughter of the late Farrow and Betty Tackett Bryant. Mom married Estile Ted Newsom on
                        January 28, 1933, unto this union was born seven (7) children, one preceded her in death, James
                        Estile, died as an infant. Mom was preceded in death by her husband, Estile Ted, who died on May
                        7, 1982; two sisters, also preceded her in death, Martha Younce and Arizona Tackett. Mom leaves
                        to mourn her loss four (4) sons: Tivis, Bobby Gene, and Paul Dean, all of Little Robinson Creek,
                        Kentucky, Clifford of Elkhorn City, Kentucky, two (2) daughters: Glenda Faye Akers, of Little

                        Flanary of Beaver, Kentucky and a host of friends and relatives. Mom spent her last days here on
                        earth at the St. Joseph Hospital at Lexington, Kentucky, where she had a short battle with
                        cancer. Mom went to church regularly, but was not actually baptized; but we truly believe, as
                        does Bro. Dewey Roberts, that Mom had accepted the Lord as her Saviour. Mom had a conversation
                        with Dewey Roberts on Friday, a week before her death; she told Dewey that her name was in the
                        Lamb's Book of Life. We truly believe that our beloved Mother has joined Dad in Heaven, where
                        they will never be separated again. By the grace of God, we can one day be with Mom and Dad, not
                        on earth but in Heaven. Our great loss is Heaven's great gain. Written by broken hearted Son -

                        heart trouble, he was so humble and bore his affliction with the patience of Old Job. He never
                        complained and was so pleased with any little thing you would do for him. He loved mom and his
                        children so very much. Dad told Mom and I that he had to die because he had lived out his time.
                        I asked him how did he know? "He said the Lord showed him, Mom asked him if he had a dream and
                        he said no I had a vision," "I was going thru a dark canyon searching for the rock and the Lord
                        showed me that I had found the rock and I was standing on it." His grandson Lacy and his wife
                        Edith was trying to get Dad to eat and he said that he didn't want that food because I will be
                        filled soon with that spiritual food. Dad told me that he wanted to be baptized and so he joined
                        The Old Regular Baptist Church and was baptized by the Brethern that he requested and his
                        membership is a the Old Long Fork Regular Baptist Church. We believe that dad is in Heaven
                        walking on the streets of pure gold. As time goes by we miss him so much and we hope to meet him

                        Elder Frank Hopkins. He was ordained as a deacon in 1928. He was a deacon of the Robinson Creek
                        Regular Baptist Church at his death. As a deacon he firmly believed in and supported the
                        doctrine and practice of the Old Regular Baptist. From the dawn of that August in 1923 when he
                        professed his hope in Christ and for over 60 years until December 13, 1983 when life's lamp went
                        out he never once looked back or longed for the things he had given up. Brother Lee moved
                        forward with the faith of a martyr and the fortitude of a soldier. He perservided until he
                        entered the haven of rest, won the crown for which he had labored, and met the God whom he
                        adored. Though he has passed over 90 milestones in the journey of life when he entered the
                        undiscovered country from whose bounds no traveler returns, Brother Lee entered it fearlessly,
                        knowing he had left all the thorns and tears behind. When the death angel came for him he just
                        went out to meet it. When the life boat departed loaded with the immortal soul of Brother Lee,
                        it launched out upon the sea of glory. All was then peace and quiet. The soft blowing wind
                        perfumed with the breath of flowers from the land of promise greeted the happy sailer. When the
                        old ship of Zion anchored within the Port of Peace she landed another soul on the pearly shore
                        of that beautiful vision of eternal repose. Written at the request of Bro. Lee by Elder Dewey

                    <p><strong>DIAMOND WADDLES</strong> It is with a grieving heart and much sadness and also with the
                        help of the Lord, I will try to write the obituary of my beloved husband. He was born on July
                        1st, 1902, departed from us on May 25th, 1984 at the St. Joseph Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky,
                        following a short illness. He was born to the fate Squint and Frankie Jane Hall Waddles. He is
                        survived by his wife Millie Hall Waddles, and two girls he reared, Doris Waddles of Kite,
                        Kentucky, and Juanitia King also of Kite. He had three sisters, Clara Johnson, Nancy Caudill,
                        and Lula Hall, all of whom precede him in death. I feel that the way he conducted his life and
                        his regular reading of the Bible, has lead me to believe that he is at rest. He came to visit me
                        in the hospital the same day he became ill, he told me he had prayed three times for me and
                        himself the night before. I feel that he is alright. I was shown in a dream, that he climbed a
                        high ladder and when he got to the top, he looked down and smiled. The time and space wouldn't
                        permit all the things I could say about him. I feel however, it's our loss and heavens gain.

                    <p><strong>GUIDA MAE KINGREA</strong> It is with much sadness that we try to write the obituary of
                        our dear little one, Guida Mae Kingrea. Guida Mae was born January 1, 1967, in Pike County,
                        Kentucky, to Ronnie and Bessie Kingrea. God blessed us to have her with us for 17 years and 4
                        months, but they were the sweetest and most loving years a family could ever wish for. Left to
                        mourn for her are her wonderful family, a very loving Dad and Mom, Ronnie and Bessie Kingrea;
                        three very understanding brothers, David B., Kenny Ray, and Ronnie Allen; one sister-in-law,
                        Judy E. (wife to David B.); a grandfather, Sid Tackett, of Beaver, Ohio; a multitude of Aunts,
                        Uncles, and cousins, all of whom we are grateful. Also left to mourn for Guida Mae are all of
                        the wonderful friends and neighbors who came and spent time with her. We express our deepest
                        appreciation of the Little Creek Old Regular Baptist Church and its members for the support and
                        concern they have bestowed upon us in this time of sorrow. With special thanks to the Meager
                        Community Club and the women of the community for the many services they have rendered. Although
                        Guida Mae was with us only a short time, there will remain an emptiness in the hearts of all who
                        knew her as they remember her from day to day because she was such a special person. On the 24th
                        day of May, the angels called for her much sooner than we planned, but now she lives with Jesus
                        until we can be with her some sweet and joyous day.</p>

                    <p><strong>JULIA ANN BREEDING</strong> With the help of God, I will write the obituary of my dear
                        companion; to wit, Julia Burke Breeding. She was the daughter of the late K. D. Burke and Sophia
                        Isaac Burke, born May 13, 1918 and deceased March 28, 1984. Julia was married to Irvin Breeding
                        on April 20, 1935. To this union was born eight children; seven sons and one daughter. Three
                        sons died in infancy, leaving four sons and one daughter. She also raised one grandson as her
                        own. The surviving children are Estes Breeding of Westwood, Kentucky; Wesley Breeding of
                        Greenup, Kentucky; Donald Ray Breeding of Charlotte North Carolina; Carl Edward Breeding of
                        Munich, Germany; Carolyn Jewell Pennington of Lima, Ohio and Kyle Chad Breeding at home. Julia
                        was the fourth of nine children born to Sophia and Dave Burke. Surviving is her mother, Sophia
                        Burke now of Greenup and six brothers and sisters. They are: Dwella May Hall of Greenup,
                        Kentucky; Liza Jane Johnson of Halo, Kentucky; Garfield Burke of Halo, Kentucky; Walter Burke of
                        Halo, Kentucky; Russell Burke of Bevinsville, Kentucky; and Daniel Burke of Worthington,
                        Kentucky. Two sisters died in early childhood; Annie Burke and Maggie D. Burke. Julia was a
                        wonderful woman. There are many things I could say about Julia, but most church people knew her.
                        Julia was sick a lot in the late fourties and early fifties. I heard her tell Brother Lloyd
                        Mullins how she prayed to God to let her live long enough to see her youngest son raised to an
                        age where he would remember her. She said that now that her son is 34 years old she should be
                        willing to go. Julia gave her hand to Elder Ellis Hopkins to become a member of the Old Regular
                        Baptist Church, April, 14, 1957, on the second Sunday. She was baptized on Apri120 by Elder Joe
                        Burke and Elder Hobert Bates. Julia tried to tell her children of the danger of dying and going
                        down to that place called Hell. Now that your mommy is gone, don't you all want to go to that
                        city where the streets are pure gold and the walls are made of jasper and trouble can't come?
                        Your mom tried her best to tell you all of the danger of dying and going down to tthat awful
                        place where the worm dies not, and fire is not quenched. Children, don't you think you ought to
                        be seeking God. He is one the forgiving hand. I want to say, be good to one another. I don't
                        know how to close, so put your trust in God. He is great and greatly to be loved. Her broken
                        hearted husband, Elder Irvin Breeding</p>

                    <p><strong>NANCY THOMAS</strong> Sister Nancy Thomas, the daughter of Jake Adams, was born in
                        Whitesburg, Kentucky, August 10, 1901 and, after months of failing health, died December 30,
                        1979, leaving her good husband, Culbert Thomas, alone at home, who did not live long after her
                        death. Sister Nancy was married to Culbert Thomas April 5th, 1924. Unto this union was born six
                        children: Mrs. Nina Mozingo, Mrs. Shelby Bockover; sons Richard Thomas, all of Greensburg, and
                        Gerald Gay of Ocoee, Florida and Gobel of Lancester, California. Lawrence C. died in infancy.
                        Sister Nancy, later followed in death by her good husband, leaves to mourn their passing five
                        children, fourteen grandchildren, one great-grandchild, two sisters, (we think at this time) and
                        numerous friends among the church. Sister Nancy joined the Thornton Old Regular Baptist Church
                        in Letcher County, Kentucky. She and good husband moved to Greensburg and bought a farm. Brother
                        Silas Frazier heard about these good people and told my wife to write them of The Little
                        Pilgrims' Home Church located temporarily on Road 46 near Harrison, Ohio as at that time there
                        were no other Old Regular Baptist Churches in this country. Sister Thomas came to our church by
                        application, and remained a good and loyal member of this church until God took her from the
                        earth. The children's Home Cemetery is the resting place of Sister Thomas' body until the
                        Glorious Resurrection, when we believe, by the witness of her life among us, that she will arise
                        with the children of God to go home to be with our Saviour. Sister Thomas and husband, at first,
                        rode the bus to get to the church. We have been to church many times in her home because there
                        were no other Old Regular Baptist but ours in Indiana at this time. I was in the establishment
                        of most of the churches in Indiana, but not until the Little Memory was established and an arm
                        given for the establishment of the Children's Home, in later years, was there churches in
                        Indiana to visit. We, therefore, met in our homes. Sister Thomas and her wonderful husband
                        always managed to be with us, both people of great faith, although he never joined the visable
                        body of true believers. I surely trust, this obituary, of this dear mother and sister in Christ,
                        will cause the children to follow the footsteps of this good,faithful mother, and press into the
                        Kingdom of Christ by true repentance, for "Except a man be regenerated and born again, he cannot
                        see the Kingdom of God." Written by, Alonzo Allen</p>

                    <p><strong>LILA MAY COMBS</strong> Sister Lila May Combs, the daughter of Elizabeth and Charles
                        Cornett, was born February 22, 1919 in Letcher County, Kentucky and died at Christ Hospital in
                        Cincinnati after suffering a stroke at her home at Rural Route, Batesville, Indiana. Sister
                        Combs was married to Clayton Combs October 13, 1934 at Hotspot, Kentucky. Her husband proceeded
                        her in death. She leaves to mourn her loss 11 children: Glyndora Combs, Norma Jean Goodpaster,
                        Billy Jack, Pauline Haney, Don Combs, Eunice Derringer, Charles, Larry, Darrell, Tommy, and
                        Sharon Uribe. A son, Robert proceeded her in death. She left one sister, Elizabeth Well of North
                        Vernon, Indiana, all her other brothers and sisters, three of each, proceeding her in death. She
                        also leaves 29 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren, and so many friends, her church brothers
                        and sisters, her vacant seat no one can fill; and a great loss to all of us. We cannot put into
                        words the terrible shock and grief to her lovely family. She was such a good mother and was
                        always trying to get her children to seek the Lord, and come to church. She loved to have the
                        preachers visit her home to talk to her children, and she was always so kind and good to them.
                        She loved to attend church, and was a loyal and faithful member of the Little Pilgrim Home
                        Church for up in twenty years. I wish to advise her children to keep close contact with each
                        other because your mother and Dad would want this. Also, your parents left you an example and
                        they have taught you the way. If you want to find the way that they sought and found, "Repent
                        and you must be regenerated and born again." This is a MUST! No other way to get into that Glory
                        World without the operation of God's Spirit. Only God can make a creature all over new to love
                        the things he hated and to hate the things he loved. If you climb up by man's way, it will lead
                        you astray. So ask of God, and permit him to lead you to "the house of his master's brethren."
                        Two daughters belonged to her church. Humbly by request, Alonzo Allen</p>

                        obituary of my beloved daughter, Jewel or Judy as she was better known. She was born January 1,
                        1930 and died November 24, 1983. Judy was afflicted from birth, having been born with a heart
                        condition and later diabetes, loss of hearing but she bore her sickness with patience and never
                        complained and tho she seldom left the house she enjoyed her life and was so much joy and
                        comfort to me. She was so fond of her neices and nephews and always remembered their birthdays.
                        She was like her name a precious jewel to all of us. Her father Eite Gibson, her brother Carl
                        and a nephew Stephen Gregory, preceded her in death. She leaves behind to mourn her loss her
                        mother Lula, four sisters, Phyllis, Mildred, Mary Lou and Nancy. Three brothers, Marvin, Richard
                        and Ronnie. Judy will always be in our hearts but we feel she fell asleep in the arms of Jesus

                        Lord, try to write an obituary of Brother Grover Moore, who was the son of Mart and Mandy Moore.
                        Brother Grover was born September 20, 1901 and passed away on August 29, 1984. He was married to
                        Elsie Slone who proceded him in death in December 1980. To this union was born two children who
                        are left to mourn his loss, Effie Salem of Raven, Kentucky and Arnold Moore of Legrange, Ohio.
                        Surviving are four sisters - Mrs. Rosie Horton of New Port News, Va., Mrs. Ethel Robinson of W.
                        Va., Mrs. Margaret Sparton of Mousie, Kentucky, and Mrs. Millie Reynolds, of Marion Ohio, and
                        two brothers - Troy Moore of Wayland, Kentucky and Tom Moore of Marion, Ohio. Eight
                        grandchildren and two great-grandchildren will greatly miss him. Brother Grover joined the Old
                        Regular Baptist Church 32 years ago and placed his membership at Caney Fork Church. Brother
                        Grover would call me from the rest home at Prestonsburg to pick him up and bring him to church.
                        He enjoyed going to church as long as he was able. I want to say to the family that I deeply
                        feel in my heart, Brother Grover is at rest and if you want to see him again make ready while
                        here on earth to meet him again. May God bless you all. Written by a brother in hope, Elder

                        whom we all loved and will miss so much. His most sincere thought was to always be ready when
                        the Lord calls us home. Virgil Smith, age 74 of Allen, Kentucky, passed away Sunday, December
                        11, 1983 at Highlands Regional Medical Center, Prestonsburg, Kentucky following a heart

                        his obituary with love in our hearts and all the good and sweet memories he left with us. There
                        is no way to put in words the hurt, pain, and loss we feel. There is no way to write or tell all
                        the hopes and dreams we had for our children, of the sweet and beautiful things he did for his
                        wife, children, and motherin-law, Nell. It is impossible to think of Clawson being gone from us.
                        At first the shock was to much to bear. But thank God he lives in our hearts, our home, and
                        souls and in every thought and things we do. But most of all, he lives in the loving arms of
                        God, just resting for awhile. Clawson Smith was the oldest son of Chester and Opal Church Smith.
                        He was born March 21, 1930 and left us December 4, 1983. His memory is shared by many in

                        his children and give them the help and love and better chance in life. To teach his children to
                        help each other and to love each other. This has been the only way we have been able to bear the
                        pain and hurt is by loving and helping each other. He gave his children the courage, strength
                        and morals to live by. To trust in God in all things. We will love him always. Clawson was the
                        happiest at home, in his garden, and taking care of his trees, with his family helping him. We
                        find great peace in knowing his love is still with us in our hearts, home and memories. We do
                        not question God's will, God knows best in all things. We ask his strength and help in bearing
                        the cross of our loss. We thank God for the love of Clawson, the husband, the father, the
                        grandfather, and the man he was. The Clawson Smith Family Betty Flo, Elizabeth Nell, Rick and

                    <p><strong>MARVIN EARNEST HUNTER</strong> It is with a broken heart I will try to write an obituary
                        of my beloved brother, Marvin Earnest Hunter. Marvin was born 1940 to Craig and Mary Jane
                        Hunter; Craig passed away in 1969 leaving his mother, Mary to mourn his loss. Marvin met and
                        married Rosetta May Hamilton in 1960. They were blessed with one son, Marvin Jr., and five
                        daughters, Sherry Lynn Palmer, Angie Hunter, Donna Sue Hunter, Jennifer, Myrtie Ann Hunter.
                        Marvin loved his children very much and worked hard for them. He was a meat cutter at Krogers
                        Meat Plant in Columbus, Ohio for about 16 years. Marvin belonged to the Little Ruth Church. He
                        loved the church with all his heart. He wanted peace with all his brothers and sisters and
                        wanted the church to prosper in love and peace. Marvin worked up until the day before he went
                        into the hospital. He got very sick and thought he had the flu. He went to the hospital the next
                        day and they told him he had less than three months to live; that was an awful time for all of
                        us to accept. Marvin said he saw Jesus and John the Baptist they came into his room walking so
                        softly. He was not afraid so he told mother not to worry, let Gods will be done. We stood by him
                        in sorrow all week before he died. He talked to us up to an hour before he died. He looked up at
                        Pearl and asked her to go with him. She said yes Marvin. He said I see a bunch of old time
                        Brothers coming and Almighty God and Myrtie, then closed his eyes and went to rest. So children
                        and Zete if you ever want to see Marvin again you must prepare yourself and get ready to go.
                        Heaven is real and is worth everything to your soul. The last time I looked at Marvin at the
                        church house, I said Brother I'll see you again. I feel that some sweet day it will be all over
                        and Jesus will welcome His people home, no more cancer, no more troubles there will be peace,
                        joy and love. May God hardest thing that I have ever tried to do. I loved him so much, but God
                        loved him more. I want the kids and Marvin's wife to remember the many prayers he prayed for
                        them and what he saw on his dying bed. He said I see Old Time Brothers and children. It is the
                        old time way. There is nothing new or modern going to Heaven. Let be clean and common and join
                        together and remember The Old Regular Baptist. It is a great light and comfort to me. With great
                        love for all of you. Written by Sister, Sue Kidd Brother Freddy Kidd</p>

                    <p><strong>MYRTIE HALL GALLIHEIR</strong> It is with a very sad heart that I'll try to write an
                        obituary of my sweet sister, Myrtie Hall Galliheir. Myrtie was born in 1920 to Craig and Mary
                        Jane Hunter. Myrtie met and married Azzie Hall. They were blessed with one daughter, Shirley Ann
                        Leisure of Columbus, Ohio and five sons: Elmer Hall of Ohio, Stevie Hall of New London, Ohio,
                        Gary Hall of Sunbury, Ohio, Lowell Gene Hall of Sunbury, Ohio. Edgel Hall and Myrtie's husband,
                        Azzie Hall were killed in an awful train wreck in 1958 in New London, Ohio. Later in life Myrtie
                        met Harlow Galliheir and then married. They had one son, Billy Galliheir. Myrtie belonged to the
                        church of Old Regular Baptist for around thrity years and lived a good faithful life. She was
                        one of the humblest people you will ever meet. She loved her children and always wanted the best
                        for them. Myrtie had that awful disease, cancer. She lived about three months after they found
                        it. Myrtie told all of us not to worry about her, because she knew she could not live always and
                        she was ready to go. She said she was going to be happy for what time she had left and she
                        laughted and talked as much as she could. Two nights before she died she said she was going to
                        ride the Glory Bound Train. My sister ask her who told her she could go, she said my Lord told
                        me so, she said yes I want to go. I feel Myrtie got on board and Jesus took her to rest. I know
                        she would want me to tell her children to remember what she told you and pray to God for
                        forgiveness and He will hear you. Someday you too can get on board that Glory Bound Train and
                        see mother again. It is very hard for all of us to accept. We have lost a very sweeet sister and
                        mother. But God knows best, so prepare to meet her again children and her sweet grandchildren,
                        she loved them so much and wanted the best for them. So be good to one another and serve the
                        Lord. He is worth it all in the end. It would be very hard to come down to your dying bed and
                        not be ready to meet Jesus, so children think and pray, God bless you all. Written by, Myrtie's

                        for bravery many times which was considered above and beyond the call of duty. To express

                    <p><strong>IMA LEE (WICKER) HALL</strong> By request of the family and the help of the Lord, I will
                        attempt in my weakness to write an obituary of Sister Ima Lee Hall. Sister I ma Lee was born May
                        10, 1926, being 57 years, 11 months and 18 days of age at the time of her passing away on April
                        28, 1984. She was a daughter of the late Cleophus and Maggie Patrick Wicker, and was reared in
                        the Lower Jones' Fork area of Knott County, Kentucky. She is survived` by her husband, Merdie
                        Hall of Puncheon, Kentucky; four sons: Wade, Tommy Wayne, Lowie and Michael Paul, all of
                        Puncheon, Kentucky; two daughters: Janet Sturgill of Puncheon, Kentucky and Bonnie Lou Slone of
                        Raven, Kentucky; one step-son: Hubert Hall of Connersville, Indiana; one step daughter: Trula
                        Crawley of Wisconsin; six brothers: Dan Wicker of Larkslane, Kentucky, Virgil Wicker of Dama,
                        Kentucky, Joe Wendell Wicker of Mousie, Kentucky, Ed Wicker, Bobby Wicker and Rondall Wicker all
                        of Connersville, Indiana; four sisters: Gladys Hurt of Urbana, Indiana, Marie Davis of
                        Connersville, Indiana, Opal Moore of Brazil, Indiana and Hazel Hicks of Lima, Ohio. Also
                        surviving are eight grandchildren, two step grandchildren, and many friends to mourn her
                        passing. Early in life she met Brother Merdie Hall, and on August 13, 1949, they were married in
                        Prestonsburg, Kentucky. Together they had many happy days. Although they worked very hard
                        rearing their children, the time came when she started thing of the day that she would leave
                        this world and face eternity before the Great Judge of all the earth. She realized a need for a
                        Saviour and the only way she could find a Saviour was by looking to Jesus. Jesus said that He
                        was the Savoiur of the world and a special Saviour to the believer. No doubt in my mind while
                        Brother Merdie and the children were sleeping or out of the house, she would be praying to the
                        Great God of Heaven to remove the burden of sin she was carrying. I believe that when she became
                        willing to give up her life that Jesus came to her rescue, and saved her soul and made it alive,
                        and alive forever. On July 31, 1977, Sister Ima Lee and Brother Merdie joined the Old Regular
                        Baptist and on August 13, 1977, (their 28th wedding anniversary), she and her husband were
                        baptized into the fellowship of the Rebecca Church, at Kite, Kentucky, where she remained a
                        faithful member until her passing. Now the soul has moved out of her body and to a place called
                        Paradise, resting until the morning when Jesus will leave Heaven with a shout and the voice of
                        the arch angel and the trump of God and Jesus will call her name. She will answer that call and
                        meet the Lord in the air and then forever be with the Lord. On the day she was laid to rest, we
                        returened home with our Daddy, and shortly thereafter we saw a rainbow colored light, which
                        glowed briefly as bright as the sun, in the skies, which then slowly moved toward the east and
                        out of our view, which leads us to believe that Mommy is at rest under the alter of God,
                        awaiting the resurrection. In closing, let me say that Mommy can't come back to us as she was,
                        but by the grace of God, we can go where she is, by falling out with sin and calling on the same
                        Saviour that Mommy called on. May God bless you all. Among Mommy's papers we found after her
                        death, the following: Written by, Elder Ellis Holbrook (Assisted by Brother Merdie and Children)

                    <p><strong>JOHNNIE H. HALL</strong> It is with great sadness that I try to write an obituary of my
                        dear father, Johnnie H. Hall. Dad was the son of the late Thomas Hall and Martha Fouts Hall. Dad
                        was born November 3, 1898 and died October 27, 1983. Making his stay here on earth 84 years, 11
                        months and 24 days. Early in his life dad met and married our mother, Mattie E. Craft, and unto
                        this union was born 8 children. Two infants sons and Mom preceded dad in death. Leaving 6
                        children, 17 grandchildren, 16 great grandchildren and 1 step grandchild, and a host of friends
                        and neighbors to mourn his loss. His children are Inez Criteser, Wakeman, Ohio, Phinehas Hall,
                        Lexington, Kentucky, Carl D. Hall, Jacksonville, Flordia. Lola Mullins, Archie Hall and Gladys
                        Hall of Kite, Kentucky. Dad was so lonely after Mom died. I think he was just counting the days
                        until he could go to be with her. Dad was a God fearing man. He loved to go to church, and did
                        as long as he was able. He seemed to get so much joy from the good singing and preaching. Dad
                        worked hard all his life. He wanted a better life for his children.. He worked for Inland Steel
                        Coal Co. for many years. Dad was sick for many years, but he never complained. He always said it
                        was God's will. Dad loved his children, granchildren and great grandchildren so much. He loved
                        to have them come visit him. He would say to them, I'm not able to come to see you, but you can
                        come see me. Then on October 12, Dad struck very ill. We took him to the hospital. He was never
                        well enough to come home. One evening Dad was so bad, he wanted Ellis Holbrook and Abel Johnson
                        to come to see him. Dad told them that he was ready to go and live with Jesus. We children knew
                        our daddy was all right with the Lord. It made us so happy when he told the preachers that there
                        was nothing between him and his Lord, and that he was going to live with Jesus. On October 27,
                        1983, the death angel came and took our Daddy home to live with Jesus, where all is peace and
                        love. So children if we want to see Mom and Dad again we have to make ourselves ready to go meet
                        them in that glorious land where there is no sickness or pain, just peace and love. Written by,

                        Adath Morris, Hippo, Kentucky, Jeannette Mullins, Southpoint, Ohio, Mamia Sturgill, Wayland,
                        Kentucky, and Gracie Johnson, Paintsville, Ky. Brother Elbert is also survived by his wife,
                        Maewood Meade Little, and four children by an earlier marriage, one son Lavonis Little of
                        Trenton, Ohio, and three daughters - Madge Edgely, Florence, Kentucky, Georgene Turner,
                        Hamilton, Ohio and Glenda Fields, Frankfort, Kentucky. Also surviving are 3 stepsons - Fred
                        Baker, Louisville, Kentucky, Wayne Baker, Valley Station, Kentucky, and Roger Baker, Ermine,
                        Kentucky. One stepdaughter survives, Rose Bentley, Millstone, Kentucky. Brother Elbert will also
                        be missed by many friends and neighbors and his brothers and sisters in the church. We believe
                        our loss here on earth is heavens gain. Brother Elbert saw his lost condition and the need of a
                        Saviour more than thirty years ago. In the year 1954, after many tearful prayers he told the
                        church he felt the Lord had saved his soul and he wanted a home in the Old Regular Baptist
                        Church. The brethren gladly received him and he lived a faithful servant until the Lord called
                        him home. A few years after Brother Elbert joined the church he felt another calling and began
                        to preach. In 1962 he was ordained to the ministry. Early in Brother Elberts ministry he had a
                        strong voice to sing and to declare the goodness of Jesus to a people that stood in need of a
                        saviour. Time and disease took Brother Elbert's health and he suffered much the last few years
                        but in all his afflictions Brother Elbert never lost sight of heaven and that beautiful home the
                        Lord had prepared for him. On Sunday, August 5th, 1984, I feel the Lord saw Brother Elberts
                        suffering was more than he could bear and God sent a band of angels to receive his soul into a
                        place of rest. We lay the body to mold back to the dust from whence it came, but God has a day
                        set in which he will call to the sleeping dust and both soul and body will go home to ever be
                        with the Lord. Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory. Sleep on Brother Elbert till we meet
                        again on that great and noble resurrection day. To you who loved Brother Elbert, I will say no
                        more can you bring him back to be with you, but by the grace of God, you can go to where he is.

                    <p><strong>BERNARD LITTLE</strong> On August 23, 1927 in the home of Dennis and Dona Little a son
                        was born. This son was named Bernard Little. Bernard was the tenth of thirteen children the Lord
                        blessed Dennis and Dona to love and to cherish. One boy and 2 girls along with Dennis and Dona
                        preceded Bernard in death. Three boys and 5 girls remain in this world of trouble to mourn for
                        Bernard. They are Lora Layne, Dema, Kentucky, Gracie Johnson, Paintsville, Kentucky, Adith
                        Morris, Hippo, Kentucky, Elbert Little, Wayland, Kentucky, Mamie Sturgill, Wayland, Kentucky,
                        Malcolm Little, Price, Kentucky, Jeanette Mullins, South Point, Ohio, Thomas Crit Little,
                        Lebanon, Ohio. Bernard also leaves to mourn 2 step children, Leah & Ricky of McDowell, Kentucky.
                        Early in life Bernard met and married Hazel Newman. They were not blessed to have children, but
                        they opened their hearts and their home to a child, Johnny, whom they raised and loved as their
                        own flesh and blood. Hazel was called away by death in the year of 1978. A few years later
                        Bernard met and fell in love with Doris Tackett. They were married in October, 1981. The Good
                        Lord blessed this couple to bring forth a little daughter into. this world, Rachel Suzanne.
                        Bernard loved his family as only a husband and a father could love. You could see love in his
                        face as he would speak of this little child. I will say to Doris, you are left to raise this
                        little daughter without the aid of your husband. I wish to God you would take Jesus in your
                        heart, he can help you through life's rough journey. As one who loved Bernard very much I can
                        tell the world Bernard loved the Baptist church and God's people. I TRULY believe he had a good
                        heart and a tender heart. I have seen him shed tears as he would sit under the influence of the
                        Spirit as the Gospel was being preached. One of Bernard's sister's told me one of the nurse's
                        said she heard Bernard praying to the God in Heaven as he lay on his bed of affliction. I thank
                        God Bernard was in his right mind right up to the end. And to you who loved him, although you
                        couldn't be by his side, the Lord was there ready to receive him when he gave his whole heart to
                        the Lord God. I hope and pray his soul is at rest today. I will close this obituary by saying
                        sleep on Bernard till that great day when the Lord will raise the sleeping dust with a shout and
                        the trump of God. Written by the family and one who loved Bernard, Elder 0. Vernon Rose</p>

                    <p><strong>KATHERINE McKNIGHT</strong> With the help of the good Lord, I will try to write an
                        obituary of my good friend and sister, Katie McKnight. Sister Katie was born December 22, 1922
                        and departed this life on December 31, 1983, making her stay on earth 61 years and 9 days. She
                        was born in Waynesburg, Kentucky, the daughter of the late Melvin and Sarah Muncie Caldwell. Her
                        brothers and sisters also precede her in death. On May 11, 1944, she was united in marriage to
                        Arnold McKnight. They were blessed with almost 40 wonderful years together. Although they didn't
                        have any children of their own, she loved and mothered all she came in contact with. Her special
                        daughter was Monica Atwood, which she has often told us Was the daughter she never had. Katie is
                        survived by her husband, Arnold of Pippa Passes, Kentucky, her foster daughter, Monica Atwood of
                        Elizabeth, Indiana, a host of nieces and nephews and many, many friends. 11 In the year 1969
                        Sister Katie saw the need for a Saviour and after feeling she had repented and was a child of
                        God, she attached herself to the Old Regular Baptist Church. In the year 1975, she came by
                        letter to the Hollybush Church and served the Lord and Church faithfully and helped her husband
                        in his duties in the leading of the church as our beloved Moderator, until the Lord called her
                        home. I'm sure she will be missed by the church and the whole neighborhood for she was a good
                        christian, a good neighbor and a mother to everyone. Sister Katie and her good companion has
                        traveled many, many miles to serve the Lord and to help people in need. They have gone out of
                        their way to get people who couldn't drive or had no way to get to church. Sister Katie was gone
                        a lot of times from her home, taking people to the doctor and visiting the sick. They not only
                        helped the churches of the New Salem Association but were helping churches in other
                        Associations. I'll say again that she will be missed greatly by all that knew her. But she will
                        be missed the most by her dear companion who walked by her side all these years and stayed by
                        her side in the hospital until she was called Home. I'll say to the Hollybush Church that we
                        have lost a good member and a faithful worker in the upbuild of the Church. So let's all get
                        behind Brother Arnold and help him in this time of sorrow. We're all his family and he has a
                        place in any of our homes. Although Brother Arnold has a lonesome life ahead of him here on
                        Earth, think what joyful reunion he has to look forward to, when he and Sister Katie can walk
                        down streets of gold together and sing praises to the Lord forevermore. Written by her good
                        friend & brother in the Lord, C. B. Smith</p>

                        have not made peace with the Good Lord. Fall out with sin and meet Poppy in heaven. He told me
                        he dreamed about going to a big green meadow on a hill and there he saw two little white lambs.
                        He said one of the little lambs was Mildred. He said to me, Pearlie I believe you will meet me
                        in heaven. When he got so bad off we had to turn him in a sheet, and he turned his head over to
                        me and said you look so pretty and that he loved me. I told him that I loved him too. He told
                        Mommy that he hated to leave her, but that he had to go on. Oh how wonderful it will be to meet
                        in that Bright City where we will never cry or have heart aches any more, or sickness any more.

                    <p><strong>MARY SPEARS</strong> In my most kind and weaknesses, I'll try to write an obituary of my
                        beloved mother-in-law, Mary Dutton Spears. She was born to Alan and Amma Dutton and married
                        Isaac Spears at the age of 16, and unto this union was born 12 children. Her husband preceded
                        her in death in 1967. Her son Freddy was killed in the coal mines on November 18, 1959. To me,
                        which left the family broken hearted for the rest of their lives. She had 4 little babies which
                        preceded her in death. I do believe Mama Spears; as me and my childrren called her, is resting
                        in the arms of sweet Jesus, where I hope to meet her soon. She was so sweet and kind to me and
                        the rest of her daughter-in-laws and son-in-laws and everyone who knew her. Oh how we miss her
                        in this cruel world, but Jesus needed one more rose in Heaven, so he took our beautiful rose
                        home, where she won't be afflicted anymore. She didn't seem happy after Papaw passed away. I
                        want to say to all her children if you ever want to see Mommy and Poppy as you all called them,
                        you better be down on your knees, time is running out, as we can see all the things come to pass
                        God spoke of. Oh, how I loved to visit her and Papaw's home and listen to them sing and pray. If
                        we only had more homes like that, there are many good things I could say about Mamaw but time
                        won't permit it. I'll close this obituary by saying children be looking up Jesus is coming to
                        get his little elect. So choose Heaven before it's too late. Written by her, daughter-in-law,

                        Keens. She was married to Will Johnson. There wasn't any children born unto this union. She had

                        Johnson. Lottie was a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church. I truly believe that she is at
                        rest. Two days before she died, she told me that she had a better place to go to. By the help of
                        the LORD, I feel that I will meet her there. Written by her broken-hearted daughter-in-law,

                        beloved husband, Dewey Martin. He was born at Drift, Kentucky, July 3, 1908. He was the son of
                        Alamander "Squint" and Nancy OsbornE Martin. He passed away March 30, 1984. Making his stay on

                        relatives and friends. Dewey was a hard working man and an honest good-hearted man. He was loved
                        by all who knew him. He was a miner most of his life and belonged to Local 5899. Dewey never
                        attached himself to any church, but he believed in the Regular Baptist. He has told me many
                        times that he wasn't afraid to die. I have dreamed, since he has been gone that something said
                        to me in such plain words, "Dewey has on along white robe." I believe I will see him when the
                        Lord comes to gather his jewels and I believe he will be one in that number. Written by his

                        write an obituary of my dear beloved father and mother, Charlie and Linda (Brown) Jones. Mother
                        was the first to answer the call of God. She was the daughter of Katherine (Turner) Brown. She
                        was born March 16, 1893, deceased this life March 13, 1967. Mother was buried on her
                        seventy-fourth birthday. She died a few months more than sixteen years before Dad. Mother was a
                        good and kind natured woman, who believed in high moral standards. Dad was the son of Markus
                        Leon Kingdom (King) and Mary (Howell) Jones. He was born May 26, 1892, deceased this life
                        September 26, 1983, making his stay here on earth 91 years and 4 months. Dad left one brother,
                        Kelly Jones, Betsy Layne, Kentucky, to mourn his loss. Dad and mother were united in marriage
                        December 28, 1911. To this union 11 children was born, one boy died as an infant. Eight girls
                        and two boys are left to mourn their loss. They are: Jessie Jones Teaberry, Kentucky, Octavia
                        Branham Craynor, Kentucky, Stella Stumbo Harold, Kentucky, Elizabeth Tackett Ivel, Kentucky,
                        Verlie Hall Clyde, Ohio, Mary Alice Newsome, Virgie, Kentucky, Foster Jones, Golda Mae De
                        Rossett, Cosetta Newsome, and Phinettie Evans, Grethel, Kentucky. Dad and mother had 57
                        grandchildren, 100 great grandchildren, and 14 great great grandchildren. Dad was a member of
                        the Zion Regular Baptist Church, joining on January 26, 1978. Mother never joined any church,
                        but she was a firm believer in God and the Old Regular Baptist Faith. My beloved parents really
                        loved the Old Regular Baptist Church. They let the members of the church build a building, on
                        their land, which was used as a House of Worship for more than forty years. Dad and mother were
                        well liked in the community in which they lived and made many friends through their business
                        associates. They had a grocery store for over forty years. Mother worked hard taking care of the
                        store and her children at the same time. Mother was very talented doing handcrafts. She gave her
                        ten children, a total of fifty quilts, ten featherbeds, and twenty pillows. Most of the gifts
                        were made by her untiring hands. Each child was to receive his/her gift when he/she married. Dad
                        was also gifted and talented. He was skilled in many trades. He was a carpenter, not only
                        building houses, but made many, many coffins for his friends and neighbors. He was also a
                        blacksmith for many years. He worked as a miner and timberman. He was commissioned a Kentucky
                        Colonel in 1978. Dad and mother believed in being honest, working hard, being good to their
                        neighbors and friends, and loving God to the fulliest. Their home was always open to their
                        friends and loved ones. Motherwas happiest when she was cooking for her church friends. Mother
                        told me a few days before she died, to kill the last chicken on the place to feed the people
                        that came to her funeral. Dad lived an extremely lonely life without her. They promised each
                        other, when they were wed, that if one of them should die, the other one would not marry
                        anymore. Dad told me, "When one makes a promise, I say, stick to it." Dad stayed with me for
                        more than four years. OH! what precious memories they both left me. Dad and I would sit for
                        hours talking about the hardships of his early life. He said, "I love staying here with you." I
                        tried to provide for his needs in every way possible. He was always telling his friends how good
                        my husband, Fred and I were to him. Mother has been dead longer than Dad, but I still miss her
                        as much as I do him. People who still have their parents should truly honor them, because they
                        have no idea how lonely one is without them. Judging from the life they lived, I feel that Dad
                        and mother are sleeping, just waiting for the great resurrection morning to claim their reward
                        in Heaven. Written by their daughter who loved them dearly, Cosetta Jones Newsome</p>

                        was always a good boy and stayed at home while he was single with his grandmother who was in a
                        wheelchair for about 8 years and he would always wait on her anything he could do for her. We

                        this life, April 19, 1984, making his stay upon earth 57 years, 3 months and 19 days. He was the
                        son of Milford and Minnie Johnson of Teaberry, Kentucky. He served in the armed forces for his
                        country for two years. Kendrick met and married Lakie Velma Hamilton on July 27, 1946. He left
                        to mourn his loss 4 sons and 4 daughters. Carl Douglas, Jimmy Darrell, Billy Joe and Roy Gene.

                        later called to the ministry. He preached God's word for almost 6 years. Kendrick's heart went
                        out to a world of poor lost sinners, he stood for the truth and he wanted everybody to go to
                        Heaven. He tried to convince everyone to show them the way through Christ Jesus. He was a sick
                        man, while he was upon earth, but now he is in heaven. Where there will be no pain, no sorrow,
                        but all peace and joy forever to be with the Lord. So, goodbye for now my beloved husband.

                    <p><strong>JERRY RAY JOHNSON</strong> It is with a sad and broken heart that I will try to write an
                        obituary of my beloved sort, Jerry Ray Johnson. Jerry was born March 12, 1957 and he departed
                        this life on April 16, 1984, in a coal mining accident on Branham's Creek, when the roof
                        collapsed. Jerry was the son of Kendrick and Lakie Johnson. He leaves to mourn his loss, his
                        wife Freda Howell Johnson and his two children, Jerry Christopher and Christy Nicole Johnson.
                        Jerry's father died three days after his death. He also leaves to mourn his loss, his mother
                        Lakie Johnson, and eight brothers and sisters. Carl Douglas Johnson, Judy Carol Hamilton,
                        Myredia Howell, Jimmy Darrell Johnson, Billy Joe Johnson and Roy Gene Johnson all of Teaberry,

                        Jerry was a good boy all of his life, and everybody who knew him liked him. He treated people
                        with respect. I believe Jerry's soul has gone to live with the Lord, because one evening after
                        work Jerry came home and told his father and I that he had seen a vision. He said "Mom and Dad I
                        saw that I was on top of the mountain preaching, and ten thousands of people were coming from
                        all directions to listen to me preach". He told us that he prayed to the Lord everyday to watch
                        over him while he was in the mines. He thanked the Lord every time he came back outside safe
                        once again. So goodbye for now my son, someday Mother will join you and your Dad up in heaven,
                        and we will all be so happy over there. Written by his broken-hearted mother, Lakie Velma

                        Kentucky. Mommie was a good wife and mother she never did join the church but I believe with all
                        my heart she was a christian woman and is at rest to day with Jesus for she would tell us so
                        many good dreams she had. Not long before she died she told of 3 dreams about tending to a
                        little baby I believe that baby was Jesus. She would tell us to put our trust in the Lord and be
                        good to one another. She would tell us what we had to do to get to heaven and if we died in our
                        sins we would go down to the world of loss. Just a few days before she died she said if she knew
                        she would meet all her children in heaven she would be satisfied. Mommie enjoyed going to church
                        as long as she was able to go and she enjoyed the good brethren coming and having church here at
                        home she said all that kept her from joining the church she couldn't get down to the water I
                        could go on and on telling the good things she had said and done but space will not permit.

                        obituary of my beloved husband and loving father, Emmitt Hamilton. He was born February 11, 1912
                        at Teaberry, Kentucky. He suffered and was being doctored for about a year for hardening of the
                        arteries. He hated so bad to go in the hospitals. He passed away January 10, 1983 after a short
                        illness in the Pikeville Hospital. Making his life here on earth 70 years and 11 months. We were
                        married 51 years and had celebrated our Golden Wedding Anniversary. We got so close together the
                        last couple of years. I told Emmitt that we had spent 50 years together here on earth and I
                        wanted us to be together in heaven. He replied, "I'll be right there, don't worry," He was
                        sincere. I knew he had been praying for quite a while before he died. He wasn't a member of the
                        church, but he deeply believed in God. He wanted me to go to church and he always wanted me to
                        pray for him. He was very happy when the members came to visit and eat with us. Everyone who
                        knew Emmitt liked him and Emmitt was kind to everyone he knew. Emmitt worked hard all of his
                        life. He was a retired coal miner. He also was a merchant and a farmer. He always talked about
                        his old mining friends. We miss him so much around our home. But I do sincerely believe he is
                        with the angels. I want to say to all of my children "Get right, and meet your Dad in heaven."

                    <p><strong>EDNA HOPKINS STUMBO</strong> Edna Hopkins Stumbo was born February 21, 1915 at McDowell
                        and passed from this life on August 18, 1984, at the McDowell Hospital at the age of 69 years.
                        She was the daughter of the late Fayette Hopkins and Virgie Hall Hopkins. Early in life she met
                        and was married to Foster Stumbo on December 24, 1935. To this happy union one child was born.
                        She is not only survived by her husband but her son Larry Foster and daughter-in-law Crissy, and
                        their children Larry Foster Jr. and Kelli Ann and Amanda Ruth Stumbo all of McDowell. Also
                        surviving are one brother Blaine Hopkins of Price and four sisters; Thelma Hall of McDowell;
                        Ethel Stumbo of Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Wilma Jones of Ashtabula, Ohio and Ruth Akers of
                        Ravenswood, West Virginia. Her parents preceded her in death, also two brothers, Ross Hopkins
                        and Guy Hopkins. Edna was at one time a school teacher but about 40 years of her adult life was
                        spent as a merchant and business woman. Her life centered on Larry Foster and Crissy and the
                        grandchildren. Edna often spoke of her great love for her immediate family and also for her
                        natural brothers and sisters as well. She loved all of them and they in return loved and
                        respected her very much. Edna also loved the children of God and was very helpful and
                        accommodating to them. During her sickness she often asked the ministers who visited with her to
                        hold prayer. Toward the end of her life she told some of them that she too was praying.&nbsp;
                        When we face the dreaded enemy death it brings to our hearts much sorrow. But we must not think
                        of physical death as parting forever. This is not the Christian concept, for the Bible teaches
                        that there shall be a glad reunion some day for all those that love the Lord. Our bodies are not
                        made to withstand forever the ravages of this life. A time comes when we must leave this mortal
                        body, "for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality"
                        and we have the assurance that when this earthly house falls we have a building of God, an house
                        not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Edna has gone home to be with our God who hears and
                        answers prayer. She prayed to be relieved of this body with its pain and to be given a new body
                        that knows no disease nor death-but joy and peace forever! Written by Adrian Hall</p>

                        to write an obituary of our sweet, loving and kind mother and sister in Christ, Eunia Newsome.
                        Born March 4, 1915 and passed away June 22, 1984. God granting her stay here on his footstool 69
                        years, 4 months and 18 days before taking her home to heaven. She was the daughter of the late
                        Henry Newsome and Matilda Newsome. She was married to Lonnie Lee Newsome on August 19, 1931 who
                        preceded her in death on June 11, 1959. To this union was born ten children, three which precede
                        her in death. Seven children living. Edward & Charles Newsome of Burton, Michigan. Josephine
                        Kendrick of Albion, Michigan, Eunia Marie, Ella Faye and Virgie Newsome of Columbus, Ohio,
                        Mattie Gallivan of Bountiful, Utah. She has one brother John B. Newsome which preceded her in
                        death and one sister Melvina Lusk of Virgie, Kentucky. Mom joined the Old Regular Baptist Church
                        on February 16, 1952 at Caney Creek. She took her membership to Caney Creek. She was a faithful
                        member before leaving Kentucky. She then took her membership to the Little White Stone Church in
                        Monroe, Michigan. Then to Mt. Judah Church in Columbus, Ohio, where she still had her
                        membership. Mom loved to go to church. She went when she was not able hardly to sit up very long
                        at a time but she would still go. Two songs Mom loved to hear and requested sung at her funeral.
                        They were "One Rose Will Do" and "I'm going to die on the battle field". We want to thank the
                        family and friends for all they did in our time of sorrow and grief. Mom had her sorrow and
                        sickness here but now it is over. So children get right with God so you can meet mother in
                        heaven some day. Written by her son & brother in christ, Elder Charles Newsome</p>

                        always reach down and pluck up the most precious and beautiful. Thats the way it was when the
                        Lord took Nannie. A wonderful wife, mother and grandmother to us all. Nannie Francis (Hamilton)
                        Howell was born January 19, 1904 in Floyd County to the late Betty (Akers) and Lee Hamilton. The
                        Lord took her home October 16, 1983 after a long illness. Nannie was united in marriage on July
                        17, 1919 to Green Howell, also from Floyd County. Unto this union were born ten children. Six
                        girls and four boys. Georgie and Lou Verdie who preceded her in death. Levi Howell of Rising

                        Howell of Pikeville Kentucky Roseanna Hamilton of Pikeville, Kentucky, Cornella Adams of
                        Pikeville, Kentucky, Alice Miller of Pikeville, Kentucky and Jean Deskins of Columbus, Ohio. She
                        also leaves behind to mourn her death twenty-eight grandchildren and forty-five great
                        grandchildren and two great greats, and a host of friends and relatives. Nannie loved the Lord
                        so much and she joined the Old Regular Baptist Church of Island Creek the first Saturday in
                        December 1940 and remained a good and faithful member until her death. Many times she would tell
                        us all of a true experience that happened to her after she had joined the church. We would like
                        very much to share this with you. Although she had joined church and had tried to be a faithful
                        member, she still felt as if she hadn't been forgiven of her sins and no matter what she did,
                        she couldn't shake this feeling. So while in church one morning, she asked the Lord to show her
                        in some way if he had truly forgiven her of her sins. She said "Lord, if you have forgiven me,
                        let the first song that the preacher sings this morning be 'I wonder what they are doing up in
                        heaven today?' As the congregation finished praying, a song rang out so loud and true. The first
                        song that was sung was 'I wonder what they are doing up in heaven today?' Nannie never doubted
                        the Lord again for no one else in that room knew what she had prayed. We miss you Mammaw! Its
                        just not the same here without you. Written by: Husband, Green Howell Daughter, Roseanna

                        were born three sons and one daughter. They are Donald, Wayne, and Rush Dye all of Pikeville,
                        Kentucky and Helen Dye also of Pikeville, Kentucky. Also left to mourn his passing are four
                        grandchildren, who loved him very much. Ella preceded Tommy in death on June 25, 1977. Tommy was
                        a loving father and a good friend to everyone that knew him. He was a good neighbor in his
                        community on Island Creek. In September of 1983, Daddy asked for Brother Wendell Hamilton and
                        some brothers to come to his home for a small meeting. That evening he gave his hand to become a
                        member of the Island Creek Old Regular Baptist Church. Daddy was baptized at Fishtrap Dam on
                        September 19, 1983 by Elders Grover Adkins, Hirman Adkins, and Wendell Hamilton; Daddy was

                    <p><strong>JAMES M. COMPTON</strong> I will try with a sadness of heart to write an obituary of my
                        grandpa, James M. Compton. He was known to his many friends as "Jim Blacksmith" : He was born
                        June 16, 1877 to John and Phoebe Griffith Compton. He was married to Stella Compton who preceded
                        him in death in 1953. Unto this union were born (131 thirteen children, eleven girls and two
                        boys. They had one child that died in infancy. The two boys are Homer Compton of Alexander,
                        Indiana and Euvette of Arizona. Dixie Daniels died in 1983, Myrtle Lindamae, Larine, Betty and
                        Francis all reside in New Port News, Virginia. Also Opal Ramsey resides on Island Creek,
                        Pikeville, Kentucky. Poppie joined the Old Regular Baptist Church at Island Creek and was a
                        faithful member as long as he could get there due to being blind. He was a sweet person and bare
                        his afflications so well. I feel he is waiting in the Paradise of Rest for the great day of the
                        Lord. Although Poppie could not see when he died, I believe when Christ comes back to get his
                        children he is going to gaze upon Him with two good eyes and see His glory to behold. I believe
                        my Aunt Betty will be rewarded for her many years she cared for Poppie without even complaining.
                        All I can say now is children if you want to see your daddy again "Repent and be born again and
                        give your hearts to Jesus". He says "Come unto me, all you that are heavy ladden and I will give
                        you rest". Well I believe Poppie did just that, and he gave him rest. I am hoping to see him
                        some sweet day, where there will be no more death or pain. Children and grandchildren prepare to
                        meet Him some sweet day. Written by his daughter and granddaughter, Sister Opal Ramsey and

                    <p><strong>CURTIS HUFF</strong> Curtis was the son of the late Lewis Huff and Dovie Nickles Huff. He
                        was born August 26, 1909 and departed this life February 16, 1982. He was married to Nana
                        Campbell November 23, 1930 and unto this union was born three children, one boy and two girls.
                        He leaves to mourn his loss: his wife, Nana Huff, three children, Garlan Huff of Mousie, Allie
                        Smith of Leburn, Kentucky, Alma Smith of Mousie, 14 grandchildren, nine great grandchildren,

                        death. Curtis was a retired coal miner. He worked hard to raise his family. He was a good
                        neighbor and liked by everyone. He never turned anyone away if he could help them. His door was
                        always open to his friends. On February 11, 1982, he was struck down by a heart attack. God was
                        good enough to let him live five days. I went to see him in the hospital. He was in the
                        intensive care unit. We had a good talk about the Lord. Curt said his case was in God's hands.
                        He said God can keep us or take us away. When it was time for me to leave he asked me to come
                        back soon and see him. He said I have some good things to talk about. God chose to take him
                        before I could go back. I feel from all he told me that day, he only went to sleep in the arms
                        of Jesus. I feel He only added another rose to His garden because I feel he believed in God.
                        Show your love for your parents while they are still with you. Sew your flowers while they can
                        see them. When death takes one of them, it's too late. I miss my Dad. We shared so many things.
                        We has so many talks in his old barn where he had his little work shop. I know my Dad is at rest

                        to direct my mind and guide my hand, I will try to write the obituary of a close friend. Essie
                        Sexton was born September 17, 1913 in Letcher County, Kentucky, and departed this life November
                        19, 1983 making his stay here on earth 70 years, two months and two days. In 1941 he married
                        Geneva Cody of Knott County, Kentucky. They moved to Indianapolis, Indiana 38 years ago, and
                        later moved to Greenfield, Indiana. On October 30, 1980 his loving companion, Geneva Sexton
                        departed from this life. Survivors include three children. Two daughters and one son, all of
                        Greenfield Indiana. Teddy Sue Sexton, Deborah Kay Earlywine and Donald Ray Sexton also one
                        grandchild, Tommy J. Earlywine. He had three brothers Archie Sexton of Letcher County, Kentucky,
                        Bill Sexton of Wi., who precede him in death, one living brother Henry Sexton of Jackson, Ohio,
                        also four sisters Monie Word who precede him in death. Kanas Aldaws and Audra Douglas of Taylor,
                        Michigan, also Ida Franklin of Jackson Ohio. In March 1982 he married and left behind his wife,
                        Carrie Phillips Sexton and five stepson's all of Indiana polis, Indiana. He left behind many
                        relatives and friends who will miss him. Other than the times of his sickness he was a jolly
                        person, who enjoyed life, and we had many good visits with one another. His daughter Sue found
                        her Daddy a very warm and loving person, who was always willing to lend a helping hand to anyone
                        that he could. (Sue) Daddy will be missed very much, it is very lonesome here without him and
                        Mother. We have a lot of wonderful memories of Daddy and Mother. They will always be loved and
                        never forgotten. Like Mother, Daddy never attached his name to any church record, but we believe
                        Daddy and Mother's Souls are at rest, around the throne of God. Daddy always stood up for, and
                        respected the Church. We believed our loss will be Heaven's gain and by the hope in my heart,
                        and the Grace of God I hope to see Mother and Daddy once more. Written by Elder Clay Willson and

                    <p><strong>PAULINE SHORT</strong> Sister Pauline Henson Short was the daughter of Emily and the late
                        Jesse Henson of Jackson, Ohio. She was married to Brother Lloyd Short of Jackson, Ohio, March
                        28, 1953 and to this union was born three sons, Lionel Short and Dallas Short of Jackson, Ohio
                        along with one son, David, still at home. Sister Pauline started her journey through life
                        September 23, 1935 in Elliott County, Kentucky and departed February 15, 1984, making her stay
                        here on earth 48 years, 4 months and 12 days. Though her life was relatively short, its' quality
                        was truly 100 fold. I have never seen a person bare her afflictions more patiently, always
                        seeking to please the Lord even in the valley and shadow of death. God blessed her to seek Him
                        and she surely found a friend in Jesus. She joined the Little Ettie Church of Old Regular
                        Baptist and was baptized the 2nd Sunday in August, 1972. She was truly a Christian who bore the
                        fruits and her life was a inspiration to all of us. So often, even as she grew weak and feeble
                        would she lift her hands and shout, glorifing her Heavenly Father. A more faithful sister to
                        labor and feed so many brothers, sisters and friends I have never known. After several
                        operations and hard journeys to Columbus to have her blood dialysis after her kidneys failed.
                        Anytime you entered her home or hospital room you always left feeling good because the
                        conversation was Godly. Finally, after a long battle with cancer the Lord said My child you have
                        suffered enough come home. She peacefully and gently fell asleep in the arms of a blessed
                        redeemer. Her voice is silent now though often in our minds we can still hear her shout. Our
                        sister is resting under His throne and her earthly tabernacle returns to dust on the hill back
                        of the place she loved so well, the Little Ettie Church. Always keep this in mind, there is a
                        great trumpet yet to sound and that tabernacle shall never fade away for it is eternal in
                        Heaven. To her faithful and loving husband and brother in Christ, Brother Lloyd, she has left
                        the hope of meeting you again. To her sons she has left a bright shining light for each of you
                        to follow always admonishing you that you must be born again. May God bless you boys to seek
                        after the Lord for you know how she always taught you. Written by Elder Paris C. Tackett Husband

                        Many students went through her classes in the seventh and eighth grades where they were well
                        grounded in the basics and went on through high school and completed college and who owe much of
                        their success to this fine, dedicated teacher who believed in a good fundamental education for
                        her pupils. In her later teaching career she taught remedial reading and continued to add her
                        special touch in helping children. The true measure of this good, hard working teacher will
                        never be fully known. She belonged to many professional organizations such as the Kentucky
                        Education Association, the Nattional Teachers Association, the Jenny Wiley Reading Council and
                        the Kentucky Retired Teachers Association. She was also a charter member of the Drift Woman's
                        Club. The greatest thing Marie did in life was receiving Jesus Christ as her Saviour and Lord
                        and devoting her life to HIS cause. She professed a Hope in Christ and was baptized upon her
                        profession of Faith by Elders Mitchell Chaffins and Woodrow Pack in 1975 and took her membership
                        at the Old Beaver Church. She was a devoted and a faithful member until death. Just as she was
                        such a good teacher so was she a good Christian. Many times when the good Spirit overshadowed
                        her she could be heard shouting the praises to her King. She has suffered much, but now she has
                        found blessed relief and God has taken her to Himself. While it is a time of sorrow for those
                        who loved her, it is a wonderful day for her. So let us today rejoice with her, for she is a
                        thousand times better off than any of us who must stay a little longer in this old world. With
                        Christ's peace in our hearts and Christ's hope in our souls, we say good-by for now and we shall
                        continue to hope to meet her again one day in the sunshine of His love where we will have
                        perfect peace, happiness and joy forever. Marie has gone on to her Eternal Home but the
                        influence of her earthly life will live on and on and on The following is a poem of her own

                    <p><strong>ORBIN MOORE</strong> With the help of the good Lord, I will try and write an obituary of
                        my beloved husband, Orbin Moore. He was born June 4, 1901 and passed away May 8, 1984. He leaves
                        behind to mourn his lost, three children, four step-children, fifteen grandchildren, seven
                        great-grandchildren and so many friends that knew him. Three children preceded him in death.
                        Orbin and I were married for nineteen years. I had almost given up hope of ever hearing him
                        praying, but the last time I talked to him at the hospital I could see a big change in him for
                        the day he had to go to surgery he told Brother Jimmy Hall that he had to go to surgery but the
                        Lord was going in there with him and I heard him pray to the Lord to save his soul and with them
                        sweet words there is no doubt in my mind that he's gone to rest where there will be no more
                        pain. He always believed in the Baptist Church and he loved pretty singing. He had a smile for
                        all that knew him and his door was always open to everyone and he always wanted them to stay and
                        eat with him. He will be missed by all but none will miss him like I will. I could go on and on
                        and say many good things about Orbin but the best part of all is that I say just sleep on, for
                        with the help of the Lord I believe I will meet him in Heaven when this life is over. Why do I
                        say this? Because of what he told me when he was in the hospital at McDowell. He said if he
                        lived to get back home that he would go to church with me but he said if he didn't get back home
                        just go on in the good old hearted way. . Written by his broken hearted wife, Dorothy</p>

                    <p><strong>ETTIE OSBORNE</strong> It is a sad attempt that I will try to write this short sketch of
                        our dear mother, Etta Osborne. She was the daughter of the late William and Allafair Moore. Mom
                        was born July 10, 1900 and passed away January 25, 1981. She was married to Elder Jesse Osborne
                        September 18, 1917. He preceded her in death in 1961. To this union was born ten children, 6
                        girls and 4 boys, 2 girls died as infants. She has eight children living: Stella Robinson, June
                        DeBord, Pearl LeBrun, Charles Osborne and Joe Osborne of Beaver, Ohio and Dewey Osborne of
                        California. She also leaves 43 grandchildren to mourn her loss, 45 great-grandchildren and 6
                        great-great grandchildren. She also leaves one sister and one brother living, Lucille Wampler
                        and Frank Moore both of Columbus. She joined the Old Regular Baptist Beaver Church in 1931 and
                        lived a true and faithful life. Everyone who knew her loved her because she was so humble in
                        life. She loved to go to church as long as she was able to go, and when she couldn't go they
                        would come and have church for her at home. I would like for all her children to try and meet
                        Mom and Dad in heaven someday. She was a member of the Little Ettie Old Regular Baptist of
                        Stockdale, Ohio ever since it was established in 1945. She loved to hear the Old Regular Baptist
                        sing and preach. Sadly missed by all who knew her, Written by her children Stella, June and Joe

                    <p><strong>WOODROW WILSON TUTTLE</strong> With love and much sadness, we will undertake to write an
                        obituary of Woodrow Wilson Tuttle. Born September 18, 1918 he was the son of the late George and
                        Rachel Tuttle at Dema in Knott County, Kentucky. He had six sisters and two brothers to preceed
                        him in death. He has one brother Fisher Tuttle, who lives at Minnie, Kentucky. Woodrow and I
                        rene McCown met October 9, 1937 and were married February 12, 1938. This union was blessed with
                        two children, Theodore (Teddy) deceased and Janie (Tuttle) McGuire who lives at Price, Kentucky.
                        He has two beautiful grandchildren Ricky and Kayla and a son-in-law whom he loved and treated
                        like a son. Woodrow loved his family, nephews, neices, brother and friends, who were many,
                        dearly. He worried so much about Fisher because he was sick and he loved him so. Our family
                        reunions will never be quite the same without him. Woodrow went to funerals for miles around his
                        home taking food and sitting up for two nights straight as long as he was able. Crowds of young
                        people attended his funeral and mourned his passing because he had befriended them many times.
                        He loved children and young people and couldn't stand seeing a child mistreated. We want Irene
                        and Janie to know that we loved him very much and that we miss him too. I know Woodrow knew we
                        loved him. Woodrow, we pray that you reached the top of the mountain as you dreamed about and
                        are waiting on the other side to greet us. We know you fell into the hands of a merciful and
                        just God who will do right by us all. Sadly missed by his family and friends, Written by his

                    <p><strong>ARNELL KIDD</strong> By the request of his wife and family I will try to write an
                        obituary of Arnell Kidd. He was born January 11, 1951. He departed this life February 14, 1984
                        making his stay here on earth 33 years and 13 days. He is survived by his wife Cathy Jean
                        Collins Kidd and two daughters: Rosechelia Artina Kidd and Sorondona Jeannell Kidd at home. He
                        also leaves his father and mother Carmel and Drakie Elliott Kidd, four brothers: Vincent Kidd,
                        Ricky and Patrick of Printer, Kentucky and Granville Kidd of Honaker, Kentucky. There are also
                        three sisters: Diana and Voralene Howell of Lake Stratton, Ind., and Christy Stewart of Honaker,
                        Kentucky. I would like to say to Cathy that I know you have spent many long hours and days since
                        God called him from you, but I feel from my heart that his soul is resting under the Alter of
                        God. I feel like God sent an Angel down in that dark coal mines and got his soul and took it to
                        rest under the Alter of God to rest till that morning when he will say Son go down there and get
                        my children and bring them home. Arnell was so sweet to everybody he met and so good to me and
                        my family. Cathy think of the time you and Arnell spent together and how happy you were. I
                        believe his time on earth was well spent. I want to say to his daughters, you had a good daddy.
                        He loves you and your mom so much. Cathy I know there is a vacant place in your life that can't
                        be filled. I believe you have spent many lonely days and nights and will spend many more. I want
                        to say to brother Curt and sister Masil I know you loved him very much. It is so hard to give
                        one up that we love so much, but God pronounced death upon the whole Adam's generations. The
                        Bible says dust thy art and dust thy shall return. I would like to say to the little daughter
                        thats never seen her daddy in this world you had a good daddy. I know when you get big enough
                        people will tell you what a good daddy he was. This daughter I'm talking about is Sarondona
                        Jeannell Kidd. She was born August 16, 1984. I could go on and on about Arnell, but we all know
                        what a good person he was. So I must close this obituary. We all loved you so much. May God
                        Bless his wife and two daughters. Written by a very close friend of Arnell and his family, Tommy

                    <p><strong>MINNIE JARRELL AKERS</strong> I will try to write a short obituary of my mother, Minnie
                        Jarrell Akers. She was the daughter of Jack and Mink Watson Jarrell and was born July 23, 1896,
                        on Prater Creek. She lived her whole life on Prater Creek except for 6 years that she spent at
                        Betsy Layne and Little Mud. She deceased this life April 11, 1984, making her stay here 87
                        years, 7 months and 18 days. She was united in marriage to Willie Layne Akers in the year of
                        1916 by Issac Stratton, a United Baptist minister, in the presence of Cola Conn and John
                        Jarrell. Unto this union was born 9 children, 5 boys and 4 girls. They are as follows: Paul B.
                        Akers, Deceased, Walter L. Akers, Honaker, Kentucky, Clark F., Vermilion, Ohio, Bradley S.
                        Akers, Martin, Kentucky, Vance Lee, Deceased, Alkie Burton, Albion, Michigan, Alpha Kidd, Ruby
                        Conn, Ruth Boyd, all of Dana, Kentucky. Since Dad passed away in 1971, Mother has made her home
                        with her children and has been very lonely without him. Her health has deteriorated for the last
                        few years. She fell and broke her hip in 1974, but improved and was able to go to church and do
                        things for herself, but 15 months ago she fell and broke the other hip making her bedfast and
                        unable to care for herself. Her children and grandchildren waited on her day and night, giving
                        her the best of care. We want to thank all of those who came in and helped us in so many ways.
                        We shall never forget your kindness. Us children have lost a most kind and loving mother. She
                        was so good to us and was so good and kind to everyone. Now God has saw fit to call her home to
                        be at rest with Dad and her two sons. Mother leaves to mourn her passing, her 7 children, 41
                        grandchildren, 81 great grandchildren, 80 great great grandchildren. One brother, Epp Jarrell,
                        and one sister Stella Conn, both of Dana. A great many friends and neighbors also mourn her
                        passing. Mother and Dad both joined the Little Salem Church, in July, 1950, and were baptised by
                        Elder J. P. Hall. The church has lost a good member and Prater Creek has lost a good neighbor.
                        On behalf of all the family and mother, we want to give our love and appreciation to Jane
                        Jarrell, a very special granddaughter. For many, many weeks, Jane and her children, spent hours
                        at mother's bedside. They have given her the best of loving care. Without Jane we don't know
                        what we would have done. Donita and Phillip became Mother's children and were a great source of
                        comfort to her. There's no doubt in my mind these children loved her. We also appreciate the
                        help and care that all the grandchildren gave her, and we want to thank all who helped, for
                        their love, kindness, and for the food that they prepared for us. May I say to Mother's family
                        let us all try to love each other. Do as Dad and Mother would want us to. We have had wonderful
                        parents and may we never forget the life they lived. Written by her son, Elder Walter Akers</p>

                    <p><strong>RUSSELL SPENCER</strong> By the help of the Lord we'll try to write an obituary of our
                        Brother in the Lord, Brother Russell Spencer. He was married to Daisy Moore in 1933. To this
                        union was born 12 children. One daughter precede him in death. He is survived by 8 girls,
                        Colletta Bolen, Ann Thurston, Linda Jones, all of McGuffey, Ohio, Muriel Johnson of Shelby,
                        Ohio, Ruth Howard of Mansfield, Ohio and 3 sons, J.C. of Morehead, Kentucky, Ova of Hueysville,
                        Kentucky and Darvin of Prestonsburg, Kentucky. There are 28 grandchildren and 16 great
                        grandchildren. Daisy passed away October 26, 1961. He belonged to the church around 37 years.
                        His membership was at the Stone Coal Church. He later moved his membership to the Little Rebecca
                        Church. He was married to Ettie Cook Wireman September 4, 1962. To this union were no children
                        born but she loves Brother Russell's children as her own. He passed away Wednesday morning,
                        February 1 in the Willard Hospital. The Little Rebecca church has lost a wonderful brother. It's
                        not only sad for his natural family, but it's sad for the church, who loved him so much. Even
                        though we hated to lose him, there's one thing for sure, God does all things well. He never
                        makes a mistake. Brother Russell would tell you God was good to him in all things. No doubt God
                        extended his life for 5 years from his first heart attack, he got well enough to come back to
                        church, we thank God for that. Oh what joy and peace it must have been when he feel asleep in
                        the arms of our Lord! I feel he has made a wonderful exchange., So many good things could be
                        said about Brother Russell. He always had an humble voice, he set a good example for the young
                        brothers to follow, he left his footprints in the sand as many Pilgrims that walked this way.
                        All the pain and suffering that he did, I never once heard him complain but stated plainly he
                        was seeking a better country. Now he has laid his cross down, he will suffer no more, but will
                        receive a glorious crown. So sleep on Brother Russell, take your rest, I don't think you will
                        sleep long. I feel Jesus is coming soon. We will meet again in that great reunion. My prayer is
                        that God will help us to keep the Faith and order and live in peace with one another. May God
                        bless you children and Sister Ettie to accept this great loss. Written by Brother Buddy and
                        Sister Carlene Carty Dad, words cannot express how much we love you. You were such a loving
                        caring Dad. You knew we loved you but somehow it seemed we couldn't tell you enough. There will
                        be a great void in our lives without you but we know our loss is Heaven's gain. Dad we know what
                        we have to do to meet you in your new home for you taught us the very best way a father could so
                        Dad sleep on until we meet you again. Sadly missed by all your children, and loving wife</p>

                        great grandchildren and one great great grandchild -In 1948, Granny joined the Old Regular
                        Baptist Church where she was a faithful member for 35 years, although she didn't get to fill her
                        seat as others did, she always loved the Lord and put her faith and trust in him. The Lord
                        reached down his hand on Sunday, October 23, 1983, and picked a beautiful flower, that he needed
                        for his garden. I feel that Granny is resting with Jesus and she is not suffering anymore.
                        Granny's home is so sad and lonely since God called her away. Her children miss her so much. We
                        all miss her sweet little smile, her loving eye's and those tiny little hands that touched our
                        face's so very gently. God blessed us with a wonderful mother, grandmother and great
                        grandmother. She always wanted her children close beside her. Thanks be to God he granted us the
                        one blessing of being able to be by her side when she passed from this world. We'll always love
                        you Granny and we miss you so much, but by the Grace of God, we'll all meet you again some sweet
                        day. You were my rose Granny. A wonderful rose of my life and I miss you so. But Granny you left
                        us with such beautiful memories, such precious memories that we'll always treasure. Written by

                    <p><strong>BALLARD OUSLEY</strong> By the help of the Lord and his great mercy I will try in my sad
                        and lonely heart to write the obituary of my loving husband, father, grandfather, and great
                        grandfather who we all loved so very, very much. He was so good to his family and all who knew
                        him. Ballard was born July 30, 1907 into the family of the late Obe and Mary Jones Ousley. He
                        passed away June 20, 1983 as the result of a car wreck. He was 75 years, 10 months and 21 days
                        old. He belonged to Local No. 6282. He had been a miner all his life until he was old enough to
                        retire. Ballard was married to Bessie Allen Ousley on August 21, 1928. Into this happy union
                        were born three sons. One died an infant. The two living sons are Ester Ousley of Manton,
                        Kentucky and Melvin C. (Bud) Ousley of Martin, Kentucky. There are three grandchildren and three
                        great grandchildren two brothers, Leonard Ousley of Indiana, and Chester Ousley of Ohio, three
                        sisters: Virgie Hicks of Hippo, Kentucky, Nora Lawson of Betsy Layne, Kentucky and Ethel Sparks
                        of Indiana and a host of relatives and friends who mourn his passing. He did not belong to
                        church but he loved to go to church every Sunday if we were both able to go. Oh, how I miss him.
                        Home is not home without him anymore. But I hope by God's great mercies I'll see him again some
                        day. Written by his loving wife, Bessie Ousley</p>

                        heart, I will try to write an obituary of Sage Frasure. Sage was the son of the late Phillip
                        Frasure and Emma Patton Reffett of Langley, Kentucky. He was born April 9, 1920; and he died
                        suddenly of a heart attack September 4, 1984 at the age of 64. He married Flossie Mae Tussey on
                        September 2, 1938. To this union three children were born: Delores Frasure, who precede him in
                        death; Ronald Frasure, and Della Ree Hitchcock. He is survived by wife, Flossie Frasure, two
                        children Ronald Frasure and Della Ree Hitchcock; four brothers: Dewey Frasure, Homer Frasure,
                        Martin Frasure, and Phillip Frasure; three sisters: Dora Allen, Ellen Reffett, and Ora Potter;
                        and ten grandchildren and two great grandchildren. He was a hardworking man all his life and a
                        devoted husband and father. He was loved by everyone who knew him. He was a retired coal miner
                        and member of the U.M.W.A. He never joined a church, but was a firm believer in the Old Regular
                        Baptist. I hope and pray that he had time to pray and call upon the Lord before he died. Written

                    <p><strong>SARAH JANE HALL</strong> With much sadness and a broken heart, I will try to write an
                        obituary of my dear departed mother, Sarah Jane Hall. Mom was born January 5, 1909 to Cleve and
                        Mary Adams Holbrook and passed away July 24, 1984 making her stay here on earth 75 years, 6
                        months and 19 days. In the year of 1925 she met and married Bill Hall and to this union were
                        born 12 children, five sons and seven daughters, two sons preceded her in death, Estill and
                        Cleveland, leaving to mourn her loss her husband Bill, seven daughters, Estie Williams, Ruth
                        Belford, Jean Seiter, and Ethel Kincaid all of Marion, Ohio, Mona Lisa Knight of Alexandria,
                        Virginia, Joan Welch of Murray, Utah, Mary Ann Rames of Ashland, Kentucky, three sons of Marion,
                        Ohio, Lloyd, Bill Jr. and Evin. She also leaves 30 grandchildren, 20 great grandchildren and 2
                        great-great grandchildren. She also leaves three brothers: Curtis Holbrook of Jonancy, Kentucky,
                        Bill Holbrook of Pikeville Kentucky, Grover Holbrook of Lincoln Park, Michigan, three sisters:
                        Cora Pobane of Florida, Bertha Holbrook of Virginia and Elcie Taylor of Waynesburg, Kentucky.
                        Her mother and father, one brother Carol and three sisters Cindy Caudill, Lear Hall and Virgie
                        Osborne all preceded her in death. Mom joined the Old Regular Baptist Rebecca Church on August
                        12th, 1952 at Hall, Kentucky and was baptized by Elder Eppie Holbrook. Mom was a faithful member
                        to fill her seat in church until she moved to Marion, Ohio and then wasn't able to go back as
                        often as she wanted to, but went to church here in Ohio as long as she was able to go. She loved
                        the old time ways and would shout all over the church house. The last few years of her life Mom
                        became very sick but she bore her pain and suffered well, for she had hopes of a better home
                        when she left this old troubled world. While she was in the hospital a few days before she
                        passed away, we had a real conversation together and she said in case she slipped away from us
                        children she wanted us not worry over her for she had a better home to go to. I told her we
                        wouldn't worry over where she was going to for we believe she was going home where she would
                        live forever, but we would miss her so much. She also told all of her children at the hospital
                        on a day when she was feeling real bad that those ones that weren't ready to go home with Jesus
                        for them to get ready and come Home to Heaven where she was going to. So we all believe with all
                        our hearts that Mom has gone home to heaven where she will never suffer anymore, I thank God
                        that Mom had such a good talk with us telling where she was going. We love and miss her very
                        much but we know that God loved her more. Written by a broken-hearted daughter and son Ethel

                    <p><strong>ARTHUR ISAAC</strong> It is with a sad and broken heart that we will try to write an
                        obituary of our dear departed husband and father, Arthur Isaac. Dad was born January 24, 1931
                        and departed this life January 23, 1984 making his stay here on earth 52 years, 11 months and 30
                        days. He was born in Halo, Kentucky to Perry and Lina Johnson Isaac. In the year of 1951, he met
                        and married Alberta Hall and to this union were born three children, one son: James Arthur
                        serving in the U.S. Navy two daughters: Ann Griffith and Bonnie Wilson of Springfield, Ohio. He
                        also leaves six grandchildren. Besides his dad Perry of McDermott, Ohio he leaves ten brothers
                        and sisters, they are: Sylvester of Wakeman, Ohio, Hearlie of Peebles, Ohio, Allen and Nannie
                        Ewing of McDermott, Ohio, Hiram of Xenia, Ohio, Franklin of Springfield, Ohio, Anna Howard of
                        Hebron, Ohio, Gloria Korns of Newark, Ohio, and Virginia Horsley of Otway, Ohio. He also leaves
                        a great host of brothers and sisters in the church. He was preceded in death by his mother,
                        Lina, a brother Albert and two infant sisters. Dad joined the Old Regular Baptist Church at
                        Little Children's Home in Laurel, Indiana. He was baptized the 3rd Sunday of September in 1974
                        by Elders Zee Holbrook, Bufford Brock and Roy Caudill. They baptized him in a chair and all
                        three of them held him. Dad had gotten hurt on the job July 29 of that year and we almost lost
                        him three times. With God's mercy he got another chance to change his ways and save his soul and
                        that he did. He told God if he would let him live a little longer he would change. Dad always
                        went to church every weekend. Even at his worse times he would find someone to drive him. In the
                        last few years he had gotten to the point that he couldn't drive at all. He had such a friend in
                        Elder Zee Holbrook and would go to church with him alot. I think Dad felt that his time was
                        coming because the night before he died he wanted to go visiting everyone even after he had been
                        sick all day. Dad tried to hide his illness from most people and a lot of people just didn't
                        believe the way he acted. He tried to laugh and keep a smile on his face all the time. Later
                        after he was baptized he moved his letter the Little Bethel Church in Sligo, Ohio. He loved that
                        church and always felt at home there. He was always talking of ways to help the church. I know
                        that along with his family that his family in the church miss him too. Sleep on Daddy, we hope
                        to see you someday. Written by a broken hearted family</p>

                    <p><strong>CLIVAN CAUDILL, JR.</strong> With the help of the Lord we will try to write the obituary
                        of our son and brother, Clivan Caudill, Jr. June Bug was born September 2, 1952 and departed
                        this life January 4, 1984 making his stay here on earth 31 years, 4 months and 3 days. He was
                        the son of Clivan and Jane Slone Caudill of Hollybush. Left to mourn his passing is his wife
                        Kathy, one daughter, Stephanie, two sons, Stacy Brent and Clivan Caudill, III, known as Little
                        Dooper. His father, Clivan, mother, Jane, three brothers, Denzil, Don Ray and Asa, six sisters,
                        Betty, Vonda, Geraldine, Maxine, Thelma and Kathy; six nephews, six nieces, many cousins, aunts
                        and uncles and a great host of friends and neighbors. June Bug joined the Hollybush Old Regular
                        Baptist Church and was baptized February 15, 1981 by Brother Burton Ratliff and Brother Willie
                        Vernon Slone. He was a faithful member for almost three years. The Church found him worthy to
                        have hands laid on and to ordain him as a minister of God. He always enjoyed helping in the up
                        build of the church. June Bug was employed by National Mines for 9 years and 7 months, always
                        willing to work and provide for his family. He also worked as an auto mechanic for anyone who
                        needed his help, never wanting to charge for his work. We feel that he knew his time was near.
                        On his way back from Sister Katie McKnight's funeral the day before he died, he talked about how
                        he wanted his funeral preached at the Hollybush Church. He wanted everyone to be able to get in
                        where they could hear the word of God. He said he hoped something would be said that would
                        change his family and friends that he loved. In his last sermon he was blessed to preach, two
                        days before his death, he said how much he loved everyone and how he wished he could take them
                        all in his arms and show them how much he loved them. Although, June Bug is gone, he left us for
                        a better and happier home in Heaven. Our hearts are broken but we hope to meet our son and
                        brother again in Heaven. Written by his broken hearted family</p>

                    <p><strong>CARLOS JACOBS</strong> Dad was born August 2, 1907 and left us to live with God March 10,
                        1984 making his stay on earth 76 years 7 months and 6 days. He married Edith Smith and to this
                        union was born eleven children. Two sons preceded him in death. He also had 34 grandchildren and
                        12 great grandchildren. Dad worked hard to raise us children and taught us all to work hard and
                        have something in life. He worked in a grocery store for 24 years and he missed it so much when
                        he retired because he loved people so much; and missed talking to them. For the last ten years
                        of dad's life he was very sick. He overcame two heart attacks and a stroke. He never complained
                        no matter how sick he was. Dad never attached himself to any church but before he died he talked
                        to me and mom of going to a better home. Dad we miss you so much but I know you are now in no
                        more pain. I know our loss is now Heaven's gain. If dad could speak back, I think he would tell
                        his children, take care of your mom and live a better life and you will see daddy again. Written

                    <p><strong>CLIVAN CAUDILL, JR.</strong> With the help of the good Lord, I will try to write this
                        obituary of Brother Clivan Caudill, Jr. Junior was the son of Clivan and Jane Slone Caudill. He
                        was born September 2, 1952 and departed this life January 4, 1984, making his stay here on earth
                        31 years, 4 months and 3 days. In early life Junior met and married Kathy Lynn Gibson and unto
                        this union was born three children. Junior and Kathy was blessed with almost 13 years of a
                        wonderful life. The last three years was the happiest of all, after they felt they had taken the
                        Lord in their home and their lives. Left to mourn his passing are his wife Kathy, one daughter,
                        Stephanie, two sons, Stacy and Clivan III, known as little Dooper. Also his father, Clivan, his
                        mother, Jane, six sisters: Betty, Vonda Lee, Geraldine, Maxine, Thelma and Kathy; three
                        brothers: Denzil, Don Ray and Asa; many uncles, aunts and cousins and a great host of friends
                        and neighbors. Brother Junior had proved himself to be anointed of God and the church found him
                        worthy to have hands laid on and to ordain him as a minister of God. He was such a good and
                        faithful member and worked so hard for the up build of the church. The church has lost another
                        good member and pillar that we will greatly miss. Brother Junior worked hard in the coal mines
                        and as an auto mechanic to provide for his family. He was on the go all the time, working and
                        helping his friends and never wanting to charge them for his work. He loved everyone so much and
                        always wanted to help in anyway he could. We feel that Brother Junior knew his time was close.
                        On his way back from Sister Katie McKnight's funeral the day before he died, he talked about how
                        he wanted his funeral preached at the Hollybush Church that he so dearly loved. He wanted
                        everyone to be able to get in where they could hear the word of God. He said he hoped that
                        something would be said that would change his family and friends that he so dearly loved. In his
                        last sermon that he was blessed to preach, he said how much he loved everybody and that he
                        wished he could take them all in his arms and show them how much he loved them. The last few
                        years of his life have been a light to everyone who knew him. So many times, I have heard him
                        pray for his brothers and sisters and all his friends, hoping they would turn to the Lord. We
                        feel that our loss is Heaven's gain and believe that Brother Junior is now enjoying the
                        realities of Heaven with the Lord and his Angels. I know that Kathy's home is broken and that
                        Brother Clivan and Jane are heart-broken, however, the Lord said he would not put more on us
                        than we could bear. Just trust in the good Lord and He will see you through the bad times ahead.
                        I want to say to his family, Brother Junior would not want you to weep for him, but to cry unto
                        the Lord for yourselves, if you want to meet Brother Junior again for that great family reunion,
                        you must do what Brother Junior did a few years ago. Put your life in the Lord's hands and He
                        will take you home to meet Brother Junior again. Written by a dear friend and brother, C. B.

                        January 29, 1923 and died September 27, 1983, making his stay on earth 60 years, 7 months and 28
                        days. He was a world war II veteran, serving 1 year 8 months and 25 days overseas, during which
                        time he was wounded in Italy on November 6, 1945. After hospitalization for his wounds, he was
                        captured and transferred to a prison camp in Germany, where he was held captive for 16 months
                        until the U.S. forces liberated the prisoners. During his military service, he received the
                        European African Middle Eastern Campian Medal, The Purple Heart, and a Good Conduct Medal. He
                        was married to Sandra Arnett on December 25, 1954, a marriage lasting over 28 years and
                        separated only be death. Unto this union there was one son born, Keith Brent Shepherd. Other
                        survivors include one granddaughter, Katherine Jane Shepherd. Three sisters: Lola Shepherd,
                        Gunlock, Kentucky, Frankie Fugate, Maybee, Michigan, Olivia Alton, Ypsilanti, Michigan. Two
                        brothers: Elmer Shepherd, Tucson, Arizona, Farley Shepherd, Gunlock, Kentucky. Van Shepherd,
                        James Shepherd and 2 infant brothers preceded him in death. He was a member of the Little Martha
                        Old Regular Baptist Church, joining and being baptized on June 24, 1975 at 9:00 p.m. He loved
                        nothing better than going to church to hear the word of God, going faithfully until hindered by
                        illness. Emit was a pillar of strength, suffering from terminal cancer and heart disease for
                        more than 8 years. He would often counsel his family and friends to attend church and serve the
                        Lord. He touched many lives during his stay here on earth and served as a teacher and friend but
                        above all he was a faithful and devoted husband and a loving dad. The funeral was held at Little
                        Martha Old Regular Baptist Church, Friday, September 30, 1983 at 10:00 Burial followed at the
                        Dan Shepherd Family Cemetery at Fredville, Kentucky. He was so special to us, I know his
                        suffering is over. My mind goes back to the many hospital stays, surgeries, his confinements to
                        bed, the intensive care units and all the times he was on the critical lists. I wish I could
                        have taken his pain. We are lonely, sad and discouraged. We feel the loss of a strong bond of
                        love. He was our life here on earth. Lord, let me not forget Katherine Jane, Emit's
                        granddaughter. He never got to see her, but somehow Lord, I am sure his prayers live on. Now,
                        Lord, Emit fulfilled the role you sent him here to do, the job ofa son, husband, father,
                        grandfather, brother and your child. Now Lord, bind our hearts together with your love. Let us
                        live in the shadow of Emit's love and meet him. Lord, help us through this separation until we
                        meet all our loved ones. We thank you Lord for Emit to love. We give you the thanks for sharing
                        Emit with us and knowing we shall meet him if we have learned from him what he learned from
                        you-You are the life, the way. Amos 4:13 says: For, Lo, He that formeth the mountains, and
                        createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness
                        and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, the Lord, the God of Host, is his name. May we
                        be ready to meet you as Emit said he was ready to go when you were ready to take him home. Your
                        word tells us, "Wait on the Lord: Be of good courage, and he will strengthen thine heart: Wait,
                        I say, on the Lord." Psalms 27:14. Forgive us Lord, for weeping, but unite our hearts so that we
                        can live in Emit's memory. Now he is with you, may we not lose sight of that, but be ready as
                        Emit was ready. His many expressions of love and kindnesses will be with us until we meet again.
                        Dear Lord, may his separation from us make us strong in the things he stood for, and just keep
                        in mind that where he now is we too will be someday, by the same path he had chosen. We are
                        grieving, and the pain is so real. Written by Keith Brent Shepherd, Son and Olivia Alton, Sister

                    <p><strong>GEORGE PRESTON CASTLE</strong> With a sadness in my heart and the help of God. I'll try
                        to write an obituary of dear old Dad. He left this world September 29, 1983. George Preston
                        Castle was born April 25, 1897 at Prestonsburg, Kentucky. The son of Henry Castle and Jahazel
                        Castle. He left behind to mourn his death, his faithful companion of 64 years, Lou Sinda Castle.
                        Eight children: Hillard M. Castle, Henry H. Castle, Ruby Jean Castle, Mary Ann Smith, William
                        Castle, Ballard Castle, all of Stockbridge, Michigan. One daughter, Febie Shephard of
                        Hueysville, Kentucky who preceded him in death. Elbert L. Castle of Mason, Michigan, Franklin D.
                        Castle of Leslie, Michigan. Thirty seven grandchildren and fifty great grandchildren. Dad joined
                        the Old Regular Baptist Church in 1949 at The Old Stonecoal Church. He was in this race along
                        time, just to have two children join him in the old church. Dad didn't have much in life,
                        according to some standards. But the race is over now, he has won the grand prize, a heavenly
                        home. Dear love ones, please turn to God, and we can share Dad's prize, at the end. Written by

                    <p><strong>JAMES D. TACKETT</strong> I pray that God will help me write this obituary. The past six
                        years has been especially hard on the family mentally and physically. But the good Lord has
                        promised, he will not put no more on usthan we can bear. Brother Jimmy was born November 2,
                        1926. And deceased April 10, 1984. He was the son of Sol and Annie (Osborne) Tackett. He had one
                        daughter, his father, mother and four brothers proceeded in death. He leaves his wife Leona and
                        two daughters Carol and Donna, seven sons James, Ronald, Billy, Gary, Jerry, Larry and Terry,
                        all of Westland, Michigan. Sixteen grandchildren, four step grandchildren. One brother Clarence,
                        five sisters Kathryn, Bertha, Margie, Mae and Mary to mourn our loss. But I believe Brother
                        Jimmy is resting around the Alter of God. With all his pains and sorrow behind him. He was a
                        very sick man for many years. Now his suffering is over. We all miss him so much. I am sure his
                        wife and children will spend many lonely hours. I pray that God will be with them and comfort
                        them. He loved his church and his family. If he could talk to us, he would say Repent and live
                        for Jesus. For He is the only way from earth to Glory. The Good Shepherd watches over us all.

                    <p><strong>HIBBARD LITTLE</strong> It is with a sad and very broken heart that we attempt to write
                        this obituary of a very dear loved one, Hibbard Little. He was the son of Creed and Sarah
                        Elswick Little. He was born in Pike County on January 15, 1910. He left this troublesome world
                        to be with Jesus November 28, 1983. He was married to Viola Tackett Little March 28, 1929. He
                        was a faithful hard working husband, striving to give his family the comforts of life. To this
                        union were born six children, five preceded him in death, Justine, Edith, Randall, .end Namon
                        all died in infancy, Hobert Eugene died of a heart attack in 'P979. One lonely daughter, Flo
                        Varney of Virgie survives. He also leaves a grieving widow, 14 grandchildren, 14 great
                        grandchildren. Brother Hibbard joined the Regular Baptist Church May 30, 1947. He loved God and
                        God's people. When you talked with him, his conversa tion always turned to Jesus and the church.
                        He was a man that loved his family and his grandchildren and great grandchildren all loved their
                        Papaw. He was a retired miner and suffered much with his lungs, going to church many times when
                        he wasn't able. But he's gone to a country where he has a new set of lungs filled with God's
                        spirit and will never suffer any more. He was a Deacon in the Enterprise Church, where he served
                        his duties well. His family all loved him dearly and grieves daily over this terrible loss of
                        such a loved one. We miss you Papaw and we hope to see you again some day. We believe he is in
                        heaven where he always talked about going some day. God be with you. Written by his broken
                        hearted wife, Viola Little and his bereaved family, and by his sister in the church, Sister

                    <p><strong>HETTIE LAYNE TACKETT RAY</strong> Gone home at last. For the past five years this has
                        been her plea"Take me home". Hettie Layne Tackett Ray, the daughter of Abbey and Corrilla
                        Anderson Tackett, was born February 15, 1906. She was married to Noah Ray. To this union was
                        born two children: Margaret Hope Ray Green and Noah D., Jr. Junior preceded his mother in death
                        February 8, 1977. She also had two grandchildren: Nancy Lea Green Bias and Tony Ray, three
                        great-grandchildren: Caroline Hope Bias, Tony, Jr. and Michael Ray. Hettie came from a large
                        family that is swiftly going back to mother earth. She leaves three sisters: Bessie Osborne,
                        Lakeland, Florida, Edith Tackett, Virgie, Kentucky, Opal Allen, Proctorville, Ohio-two brothers:
                        Wick Tackett, Lexington, Kentucky, Stanford Tackett, Virgie, Kentucky. Hettie had spent the last
                        few years in the Mountain Manor Nursing Home where she loved all the staff working there and
                        kept them entertained with her lovely singing. No matter how bad she felt, she was always
                        willing to sing for anyone who asked and her lovely voice always stayed strong and melodious.
                        She joined the Enterprise Church about 50 years ago and remained a faithful member until her
                        death. Hettie had a hard life in this world, but when Jesus gives her the keys to the mansion
                        prepared for her and her long white robe, her lovely voice will be tuned to sing in the heavenly
                        choir and all her toils and sorrows will be over. Her sister in the flesh and in the Lord, Edith

                    <p><strong>TONEY SPARKMAN</strong> With many sweet memories and a lonely and sad heart, I'll try to
                        write the obituary of our dad and loving husband. Dad was born on September 29, 1912 to Roach
                        and Anna Sparkman of Hueysville, Kentucky, making his stay here on earth 71 years. Dad was
                        married to mom, Julia Bentley on March 28, 1931. Born unto them were three children. They were
                        Gladys Compton of Shiloh, Ruby Tackett of Shiloh and Dalphene Spencer of Morehead, Kentucky.
                        Surviving are three brothers. They are Willie and Johnny Sparkman of Hueysville, Kentucky and
                        Homer Sparkman of Willard, Ohio. There are eleven grandchildren and fourteen great grandchildren
                        who miss him very much. Dad gave his heart to God 51 years ago and was baptized into the Old
                        Regular Baptist Church. Dad has been a light to his children in the world. He went to church as
                        long as he was able. After he could no longer walk and go to church, he loved for the brothers
                        and sisters to come to his house have meetings. I know it helped on his journey. The death angel
                        came the 14th of October in 1983, leaving our home so lonely and sad. I believe Dad fell asleep
                        in the arms of Jesus. Dad couldn't speak to us before he left us. There was much sadness and
                        sometimes joy in his loving face. We know Dad hated to leave us in this sinful world. We love
                        and miss Dad very much, but, God loved him more. God needed another rose for his Garden. I
                        believe Dad could see into Glory Land just before he went to sleep. As my sister, Ruby, stood
                        beside his bed, he pointed his finger out the window. He was trying to show her something that
                        natural eyes cannot see. She said his eyes sparkled and were so bright, no doubt what he saw was
                        beautiful. Oh, how I longed to see what Dad had seen. I know Mom misses Dad very much. She's
                        like the little dove mourning because she has lost her mate. I hope and pray, if it's the Lord's
                        Will, that he'll leave Mom with us awhile to fill in the sadness and the emptiness since Dad has
                        gone. Dad labored hard in the coal mines to raise his children. But, now his laboring and
                        suffering is over. When he became sick and unable, he didn't complain. He took it like a
                        soldier. He's much more than a dad or grandfather. He was a friend who was always there when we
                        needed him. He left us so many good memories to keep us all going on. He had the patience of Job
                        and wisdom of the Bible that God had given him throughout the years. His place at the table is
                        empty now, but I'm sure he's feasting on God's Glory. All the atomic bombs cannot wake Dad. But
                        when Gabriel blows his trumpet, Dad will awaken and go home with that blood washed band. I have
                        hopes of seeing Daddy again and I believe, I'll know him on that bright and heavenly shore.
                        Sleep on Dad, take your peaceful sleep. I know It's what you were longing for. Oh my children
                        and loving sisters, if you want to see Daddy again, get your ticket while there is still time,
                        for time is running out. The entire family would like to express thanks and appreciation to all
                        the friends and brothers and sisters of the church who helped ease the pain. Written by his

                    <p><strong>SUSIE HUGHES ADKINS</strong> With great sorrow, I try to write this obituary of my
                        mother, Susie Hughes Adkins. You were a great mother and the best of friend to everyone who knew
                        you. You never let anyone leave your home hungry. Mom was born August 2, 1896 to Daniel Hughes
                        and Martha Prater Hughes. She was married to Jack Adkins, who preceded her in death February 14,
                        1953. She often talked of Dad and how lonely it was without him; but I feel they are both
                        together now. Mom joined the Old Regular Baptist Church 38 years ago. She left four children to
                        mourn her death-Mildred Bellamy, Orville, Tramble, and Ezra Adkins and one foster daughter,
                        Christine Hughes Vanderpool. Two brothers-Billie Hughes and Jake Hughes, and one sister Sara
                        Collins. 15 grandchildren, 29 great grandchildren, 4 foster grandchildren and 4 foster foster
                        great grandchildren. Mom, we all miss you, but our loss is Heaven's gain. We hope we can all

                    <p><strong>JAMES MONROE VANDERPOOL</strong> It is with deep grief that I attempt to write this
                        obituary of our precious son and husband of Jackie, James Monroe Vanderpool, who was born May
                        26, 1951 and deceased this life March 5, 1984, who was the son of Monroe Vanderpool and Mary
                        Smith Vanderpool of Hippo, Kentucky, both parents and his companion survive. In all my dozens of
                        years in writing, this is the most difficult task that I have faced. January 1, 1982 James was
                        united in marriage to Jacqueline Wireman of Waldo, Magoffin County, Kentucky, the daughter of
                        Arnold and Fairley Wireman. No children were born unto this union. Elder Jimmie Hall performed
                        the marriage ceremony. James was born at Hippo, Kentucky and lived in this community all of his
                        32 years of life. It seemed that everyone that he came in contact was a friend as his cheerful
                        personality seemed to reach their heart. Before his marriage he built his home with the help of
                        his companion, Jackie. He was a boy that wanted to work and make his own way in this life. He
                        did not want to put a hardship on any person. His death came as an accident while working at a
                        Coal Tipple on Caney Fork of Middle Creek, he being a Foreman of the Company of Nerco Hiller
                        Coal Company. Surviving brothers are: Fred, Clyde, and Carl Ray of Hippo, Kentucky and Lowell of
                        Willard, Ohio. One sister survives: Jewell Vanderpool Cook of East Bernstadt, Kentucky. One
                        grandmother survives: I lant Smith of Gunlock, Kentucky. Surviving relatives and friends are so
                        numerous that I could not begin to estimate the number. Probably everyone that he came in
                        contact with was a friend to him, as he always had a smile and something to say seemed like to
                        cheer them along their way. As I look at all of the wall of the church house covered with
                        beautiful flowers, then I know how he was loved. James did not belong to any church. He did
                        notice the walks of Christian people and respected them. Oftimes in my council to him he would
                        say "Dad you do not have to tell me that because I know about the Life which you have lived
                        before me." His mother-in-law said that he had made remarks that he would like to be like his
                        Daddy. James had been carrying a tiny Bible in his billfold for years, which was faded and worn
                        with date 1975 dated in the back. This brought back memories of a little testament which I
                        carried through the Battlefields of Europe during World War II. James companion requested that
                        this bible which he was carrying be buried with him. Now a precious loved one is gone. An
                        emptiness is in my soul that only God can help. We do hope that James, before his soul left this
                        earth that he touched the garment of Jesus. His companion said that he had asked her in the
                        mornings if she ever thanked God that he had let her live through the nights. He told her that
                        he did. God only knows the Destination of a person when they leave this earth. The judgment
                        which God will give to all persons will be right. As the song we sing "Oh, if I had some secret
                        place that I might hide from sorrow", I do feel and believe with all my heart that I have that
                        with my God. My companion and myself have been serving God for many years. I know not who
                        belongs to God, but if James' brothers and sister, companion, relatives and friends have not
                        made peace with God, I do hope they will consider their ways while life and opportunity affords
                        them the privilege. We know death is coming to us, but know not when. In my farewell words, I
                        pray that the good Lord will look down upon my afflicted companion and little Jackie (James
                        loved her so dearly) and strengthen them. I hope our family can grow closer, and I hope I can
                        dedicate my life more fully in serving my God. I am not an old man, but I know that I am nearing
                        my Life's end, and oh how I wish all my relatives and natural friends would meet with all of
                        God's people in Heaven where pain, grief and sorrow will be no more. Great consollation has been
                        given me since I have written the foregoing, Charlotte, the bookkeeper of the Company where
                        James worked said he had told her in talking to her that if he was killed that the Lord's arms
                        were open for him. Written by his father Brother Monroe Vanderpool </p>

                    <p><strong>ARTIE DAMRON</strong> Artie Tackett Damron was born May 30, 1885 at Robinson Creek,
                        Kentucky. She was the daughter of the late Hiram and Nancy Damron Tackett. She grew up a few
                        hundred feet from the Robinson Creek Old Regular Baptist Church. In later life as she would help
                        work at the Robinson Creek Church she would often tell of her childhood days working and playing
                        on the little knoll where the church house now stands. She departed this life April 6, 1984 at
                        the age of 98 years, 10 months and 6 days. On September 10, 1903 she was married to Elisha
                        Damron, the son of the late Alfred and Mary Kinney Damron. To this union was born 9 children.
                        Four sons preceded them in death. Elisha preceded Artie in death April 2, 1949. For over 46
                        years they had shared the joys and sorrows of life. Artie remained a widow for the 35 years of
                        her life that remained. She is survived by 2 sons: Martin Damron and Thomas J. Damron both of
                        Santa Barbara, California, and 3 daughters; Virginia Adkins, Virgie, Kentucky, Nannie Mae Combs,
                        of Redding, California and Oma Elizabeth Walters of Ashland, Kentucky. She is also survived by
                        18 grandchildren and 34 great grandchildren. She loved her children very much and they loved her
                        too. She enjoyed her visits with them and often talked about how she enjoyed flying in a jet
                        plane to visit some of them. Artie and Elisha joined the Old Regular Baptist Church in August,
                        1947. After telling an experience of grace they were baptized by Elder Frank Hopkins and Elder
                        Baxter Osborne. They requested their membership be at the Robinson Creek Church. She loved the
                        Lord and she loved the Robinson Creek Church. Sister Artie was gone this spring but the
                        beautiful flowers that she planted around the church still bloomed. When she was able she would
                        walk to the church and spend hours and hours caring for these flowers. Many of the Robinson
                        Creek members affectionately called her "Ole Faithful". The weather would not get too bad for
                        Sister Artie to come to church. When she got disable to walk Gratho and Virginia would bring
                        her. She had a special love for people. She was always making little gifts for them and she
                        tried to make the lives of others more cheerful. She loved the song "Just One Rose Will Do". She
                        knew it was the intent from the heart that was important. As the white lily tree she planted in
                        the church yard never forgets to bloom so will the life she lived be remembered and greatly
                        missed. Written by Virginia Adkins and Elder Dewey Roberts</p>

                    <p><strong>HOOVER CURTIS AKERS</strong> How do you say good-bye to a precious father? Hoover Curtis
                        Akers left this life to go home with Jesus on Tuesday, October 4, 1983. Let it be known that Dad
                        lived his whole life for his family, making each of us feel so very loved in his own special
                        way. He entered this world on October 12, 1928 in the home of his parents, Allen Wince and
                        Myrtle Boyd Akers as the fourth of seven surviving children. In the mountains that surround us
                        now, Dad spent many a happy day with Ervin, Evan, Daniel, Lazelle, Ray and Juanita. He left
                        these hills of Kentucky with a homesick heart to find work in Ohio. Dad was a builder by trade
                        and a builder by heart-molding his world around his sweet loving wife of 36 years, Helene Conn
                        Akers. Their foundation was laid on June 7, 1947 in Lancer, Kentucky. Unto this union was
                        brought the first building stone, Sherry Helen, the next Sandra Kay, and the family home was
                        completed with their baby girl Sheila, in Vermilion. Dad always put us first, letting us live
                        our own lives, choose our own paths, and guiding the paths we chose. Thru the storms that raged
                        our lives, he was always there to take our hands and comfort us. Dad had his way of turning the
                        darkest cloud into a beautiful rainbow. One by one his girls left the family home to make homes
                        of their own. Sherry chose Allen Ray Bohl, Sandra chose Lindy E. West and Sheila chose Lawrence
                        Kenneth Peachock. Dad was blessed with three handsome grandsons, Brett Allen, Shane Patrick and
                        Nathan Gregory. He lovingly called them "his boys". He was more than just Grandad to his boys.
                        He was their friend, their confider, and a compassionate guide. Two little rosebuds bloomed, his
                        darling granddaughters, Heidi Cherie and Valerie Lynn. They blossomed in a special place in
                        Dad's heart which he prepared for his two little angels. Dad was a man of strong values in life:
                        honesty, brotherhood, dedication to excellance in work, and a true faith in God. Dad saw a job
                        through to the finest detail in every aspect of his life. His final detail, the most important
                        of all, was to tell us all to "Trust in the Lord"' With saddened hearts, but joyful souls-we say
                        "good-bye, Dad." Precious Lord, take his hand . . . lead him home. We miss you, Sherry, Sandy &

                        I will try to write an obituary of my dear sister Lura Hamilton. The daughter of the late Joe
                        and Sally Ann Hughes of the Mousie, Kentucky area. She was born September 27, 1902 and departed
                        this life April 12, 1983 at the Methodist Hospital of Pikeville, Kentucky. After spending some
                        days in serious condition suffering from a stroke. At the age of approximately 22, she was
                        married to Dewey Gibson of Right Beaver, Kentucky. And to this union was born 1 daughter,
                        Sylvia. She and her first husband were divorced. Then she married, Jake Hamilton of Allen,
                        Kentucky and to this union were no children born. But Jake cherished Sylvia as his own child. In
                        the year of May 8, 1966, Sister Lura was converted and gave her hand to become a member of The
                        Regular Baptist Church, and took her membership at The New Salem Church at Harold, Kentucky and
                        was a very faithful member until death. She is survived by her daughter Sylvia and son in law,
                        Russell Wilson of Wawaka, Indiana, and her 4 grandchildren, 9 great grandchildren, her
                        relatives, friends, brothers and sisters of the church and neighbors to mourn her passing. I
                        have had so many wonderful conversations with her concerning her hard trials of life. And her
                        joy in her's and our precious redeemer, King Jesus. She lived a lonely life by herself after
                        Jake died. She said brother Edd I know I can go live with Sylvia in Indiana, and she wanted me
                        to. But I am an independent person. Sylvia and Russell and grandchildren, I know you loved her
                        so very much and she talked of her love for you all. And you stood by her side to answer her
                        ever call in her time of sickness in the hospital. But no doubt she is much better off than we
                        are. She has ceased from her labor and went on to rest in peace until as said by Job 14 chapter:
                        12-15 verses. These scriptures are very much cherished by the children of the Kingdom. Having
                        the living Hope in their souls bring to their attention the wonderful consolation of laying down
                        in the grave in peaceful rest in the name of The King of Glory until the wrath of the Great
                        Soverign God of all Eternity has passed. And the Heavens be no more. And that he has appointed a
                        time to call them, his believers, the children of the Kingdom, from the power of the grave, give
                        them the new (Spiritual) body, meet them in the air, and convey them to Glory to appear in the
                        present of The Father of eternal ages. Bless Christ when our minds is clear of pain, misery,
                        sorrow, and tribulations of this present world and we can thank or he causes us to meditate on
                        him and his righteousness, it is then we can say as the old writer did., His joy, kindness, and
                        love is altogether to good for wretched me. So my final words in this obituary is sleep on dear
                        pilgrim sister. May God Bless your little family, keep them, guide them, and lead them, that
                        they may meet you in Glory Land. Written by her brother in hope of sweet glory Elder C. Edd Kidd

                    <p><strong>JAY JUSTICE</strong> With much love and a sad heart, I write this obituary of our father,
                        Jay Justice. Dad was born the fifth son to Will and Rissie Farmer Justice on April 17, 1902 and
                        passed away May 25, 1984, making his stay here 82 years, one month, and eight days. His father
                        and mother preceeded him in death as did six of his brothers. They were Hut, Liburn, Leston,
                        Layne, Bill, and Dick. He leaves two other brothers, Charlie and Walter of Pikeville, and one
                        sister, Amanja Rowe of Virgie, Kentucky. In his young days he met my mother Martha Ray and on
                        September 29, 1923 they were wed. To this union were born six children: Arland Justice of River
                        Rouge, Michigan; Mabel Roberts of Macon, Georgia; Katherine Hoak of Lincoln Q ark Michigan:
                        Beatrice Breakenkamp of Lexington Kentucky; Barbara Brewer of River Rouge, Michigan; and Jay
                        Justice, Jr. of Southgate, Michigan. He was a grandfather to 27 of our children and a great
                        grandfather to 25 of their children. Our dad was a hard working man all of his life. He was a
                        carpenter by trade. I remember when we were young, he would come home after working all day and
                        then spend hours in his garden and orchard, which he dearly loved. I don't ever remember a
                        single day we didn't have food on our table, and enough food left over for people less fortunate
                        than ourselves. Only now that I'm an adult, do I appreciate how hard he had to work to make all
                        that possible. Our father became a Christian exactly 10 years to the day before his death. He
                        was baptized at the Old Regular Baptist Church in Pikeville, Kentucky on May 25, 1974. He loved
                        to go to church as long as he was able to go. His eyes had gotten so bad in the last few years,
                        he could no longer read his Bible. Even though he could no longer read the Bible, he was able to
                        listen to tapes of the Old and New Testament, which he enjoyed so much. Dad's last week with us
                        were the saddest days of our lives. It was so hard to see him lay there so helpless, but we are
                        all thankful we could be by his side those last days and do what we could to make him
                        comfortable. We would like to thank all the friends, relatives and the members of the Little
                        Ida, and Pikeville Baptist Church, who were so kind and thoughtful. In addition, we would like
                        to especially thank Whipple Reynolds. There was no man our father respected more. Dad's resting
                        place is in Johnson Memorial Cemetary, Pikeville, Kentucky. Written by his children and wife</p>
