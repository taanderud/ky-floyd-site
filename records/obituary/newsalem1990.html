  <p>1990 New Salem Association of the Old Regluar Baptist Church</p>

  <p>1990 New Salem Association Hosted by: Ball Branch, Providence, Rebecca, Caney Fork, Hollybush, Mt.Olive, Ball Fork, Bethel, Stone Coal, Sterling, Rock Fork, Philadelphia, Kiser Branch, Rose of Sharon, and House of Prayer Churches. Elder Grover Adkins, Moderator Elder Ellis Holbrook, Asst Moderator Bro Dexter Dixon Clerk Elder Glenn Pack, Asst Clerk VERGIE CLICK: Grandma was born December 25, 1902 to the late William and Susie Madden Huff. On February 26, 1919, she was united in marriage to Frank Click. To this union were... born seven children. Poppy and one daughter Holly preceded her in death. Left to mourn are, daughters Shirley Huff, Mousie, Ky; Aline Rowe and Genieve Ramey, McGuffey, Oh; Wanda Lee Huff, Lexington, Ky; two sisters Allie Moore of Hazard, Ky and Lina Combs of Ohio. 13 grandchildren, 23 great grand..... children and six great-great grandchildren as well as a host of nieces, nephews and friends. Grandma joined the Old Regular Baptist Church on May 16, 1948 and was baptized by Elder E.H Howard and Elder A.L Coburn. Of her nearly 87 years on earth, she liverd 41 1/2 years as a faithful church member As I was lying on my bed asking the Lord to help me to think of things to write, I started to remember Grandma was one of the kindest, gentlest and most soft-spoken person I have ever known. She never spoke ill of anyone. She was easy going, al- ways had time to counsel and advise us children. I remembered as I'm sure the rest of the family does, her going out to chop wood milk the cow and feed the chickens. I remembered her siting on the front porchin her rocking chair striking matches on the nail... head on her chairarm to light her pipe. I remembered the times when her children would gather in and cook up a big meal, everybody talking at the same time how the feeling of happiness and love flowed from breast to..... breast, and how Grandma would always ask to make sure ever- body had something to eat. I remembered her reading the Bible and telling me stories and I remembered how they used to walk from the head of Bear Fork to church. Now as we come to the end and close the book on Grandma's life memories of her are all that we have left. But most of all, I know that she would want us to remember that she was a Christian, to love and serve one another, to love and serve God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, to prepare to go where I truly believe she has gone. I know that she would want the brethren to feel free to preach the word to her family. We all know how she lived and we'll miss her very much, but her life has proventhat our loss is Heaven's gain. Written by her: grandson and brother in the Lord and her great-grandson, Buford Huff and Scotty Francis.</p>
