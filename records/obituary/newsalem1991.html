  <p><strong>LILLIE TACKETT HAMILTON</strong>: In loving memory of our dear mother, Lillie Tackett Hamilton. Mommy was born April 6, 1915 at Craynor, Kentucky, and left us on December 26, 1989 at the age of 74. She was the daughter of the late William and Ollie Tackett. She was the wife of the late.... Craig Hamilton. Together they had thirteen children, five of whom are still living. They are: one son Purvis Hamilton of Craynor, Ky; and four daughters: Ollie Tackett of Craynor, Ky; Lurline Barnhart of New Carlisle, Ohio; Phyllis McDaniel of Churbusco, Ind; and Roxie Webb of Teaberry, Ky. She had nineteen grandchildren and sixteen great grandchildren. She also helped raise five of Dad's children, which he brought to the marriage. His first wife had passed away. Still living is Gertrude Hall, and deceased are: Lizzie Mitchell, Bossie Mosley, Sid Hamilton, and Willie Hamilton. She had two brothers Kenis and Jobie Tackett, both of Harold, Ky; and two sisters Siltana Williams of Standville and Violia Cryus of Fort Gay, WV. Mommy suffered many hardships and sad times in her life. She lost three daughters, Berbline on July 23, 1941, Lorean on July 10, 1944 and Helma on July 18, 1949. Mom also lost five sons Mack on Jan 3, 1940, Kennith on Nov 10, 1971, and three of her sons on Jan 20 1982 in a mine accident. They were Donald, Jack and Burnis...... Hamilton. She never stopped grieving over them. She sometimes talked about how hard she worked as a child at home, and she worked even harder raising her family. She was a..... good-hearted woman who always did more than her share. She always said there is no peace to be seen on this earth, so now we take com- fort in knowing she is seeing peace at last, and hopefully we'll all be together again someday. Knowing Mommy, she'll have a big dinner sitting on the table waiting for us. We love you Mommy, and miss you more each day. Your Children</p>

  <p><strong>LEONARD FRANK BAKER:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> By the help of the good Lord, I will write the obituary of a friend and neighbor in Christ, Leonard Frank Baker. Leonard was born November 20, 1920 near Laurel, Indiana on Stone Church Road and passed from this life November 16, 1990 in Fayette Memorial Hospital from a resp- iratory problem, making his stay here on earth 69 years, 11 months and 27 days.&nbsp; He was the son of Charles Clinton and Harriet Elvera Clark Baker. Leonard and Norma Louis Hohn were united in marriage in the year 1941 by Justice of the peace, Clifford Selby, at Laurel, Indiana. Unto this union were born four daughters: Marilyn Mae Davis, Sharilyn Kae Hawkins, Carolyn Jean Hulm, and Nita Louise Watkins; two sons.... Ronald Frank and Leonard Rickie Baker. Leonard was a mechanic and welder for the Franklin County, Indiana Highway Department for thirty- three years and he retired in 1984. Leonard use to attend the Little Stone Church near Blooming Grove, where some of his family are buried. The last few years he attended the Little Children's Home Church when he was able. He loved the church very much and wanted to be buried in the church cemetery, in the path where he used to walk to school. He now sleeps there from all his labors and burdens of this life. Leonard has several grandchildren and loved them all so very much, but little Josh came in time for Grandpa to enjoy in his last days. God knows just when to give special gifts. His family was very special to him, and I know they miss him very much. Leonard told me in the hospital he had Jesus and he wasn't going to let Him go. We talked about Jesus and how good He is, and what a good wife he had, and how he loved his children so very much. So if you want to see Daddy again look to the same Jesus he did, and some- day I feel we will meet him again. Written by Elder Zee Holbrook. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ======================================================================== <strong>BRENDA SUE JOHNSON BLAIR:&nbsp;</strong> In the midst of sadness and memories, I will write the obituary of Brenda Sue Johnson Blair. Brenda was born on April 7, 1960 at Fleming- Neon, Kentucky to Thomas and Beatrice Hall Johnson. In early life she met Patrick Blair and they were married on February 7, 1976. Four children were born to them two daughters Lucieda and Jamie Lee , both of Kite, Ky; and two sons Jason Brad and Joseph Patrick, also of Kite, Kentucky. On June 17, 1991 in the late afternoon at the Kentucky-Virginia line Brenda left this world and all its heartaches, when that car hit those trucks, making her stay on this earth just 31 years, two months and ten days at the time of her death. She was preceded in death by her father Thomas Johnson, one brother, David Russell Johnson, and one sister Wilma Lee Johnson.&nbsp; She leaves to mourn her passing besides her husband, Patrick and four children Lucieda, Jamie, Jason and Joseph, her mother, Beatrice Hall Johnson of Kite, Ky; four brothers Chester Johnson of Topmost, Ky; Billy Johnson, Daniel Johnson and Charles Johnson all of Kite, Ky; three sisters Louetta Johnson and Glenda Faye Johnson both of Halo, Ky; Imogene Thormsberry of Kite, Ky; also a host of relatives and close friends. I can't help but mention Lycretia Johnson, her sister-in-law and niece, where one was you saw both. Lycretia I know you miss her as much as anyone. God bless you!. Brenda was small in stature, but she could be firm and for some reason God choose to take her from this world at an early age, leaving her children for Pat to care for. She had taught Lucidea to cook and care for the house, and was beginning to teach Jamie the same. She made the statment several times that she was afraid to leave her children. The fear of something happening to Joe stayed with her. He was so sick when he was smaller. Sometimes I wonder it that was why he was hurt the least in the accident. Children, all of you have good love and memories of Mommy to keep you close in the future. Brenda had studied the Bible with her friend Betty for several years and seemed to be studying more just before her death. Pat I have no ideal how lonely you are, but God will help you raise your children, if you will just look to Him. Written by: her sister-in-law, Annette Blair Hall &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ====================================================================</p>
  <p><strong>LUCILLE NEWSOME:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Lucille Newsome was born December 27, 1929 the first of seven children of John and Sadie Martin, on Branhams Creek (Floyd County) an area that would be her home for her entire life. Siblings Paul, Mary, Ann, Betty, Bobby Gene, Andrew and Noah arrived in due course. Lucille grew up with an older half sister Ocie, with whom she would maintain a very close bond her entire life. All her brothers and sisters including another half-sister, Clara, survive her. Lucille attended Besty Layne High School during and following World War II. after graduation she attended Pikeville College long enough to get the required credit hours to qualify as a teacher in the public school system and got a job teaching elementary classes in a one-room Floyd County School.&nbsp; From this point she commenced laborious years of simultaneously holding a teaching job attending college part-time to work off her degree, and raising a family. The family was a collaboration with Andy Newsome the eldest son of William and Martha Newsome. Lucille married Andy while he was enlisted in the US Air Force. They had two sons, Gerald born in 1950 and John born in 1952. Lucille received her teaching degree from Pikeville College in 1963. She continued to teach school, finally retiring in 1983. For six years after retiring officially she continued to substitute teach, doing so deep into the illness that would end her life. Her husband Andy two sons, Gerald and John, her daughter-in-law Kathy and her two grandchildren Andrea and Gerald Brandon survive her. These are pertinent biographical facts but a person is more that their biography. Only the Lord knows the essence of a person. We are serene in our faith that His appraisal of our dear departed beloved is a glowing one of special worth. We miss you, we love you, and we ache to be reunited with you in eternity. Written by: her husband Andy Newsome, and sons, Gerald & John Newsome</p>

  <p><strong>BURNIS MULLINS:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> With much sadness and the help of the Lord I will try to write the obituary of my beloved husband. Burnis Mullins born October 30, 1913, entered into rest April 7, 1991. He was the son of the late Willard Mullins and Florence Gibson Mullins. He met and married Billie Roberts Mullins. To this union three children were born. One daughter Lorene Hamilton of Betsy Layne, and one son James (Pete) Mullins of Grethel, Ky survive. One, Dewey Lee Mullins preceded him in death. He also leaves four grandchildren and eight great-great grandchildren; one brother Herman Mullins of Hi Hat, Ky; three sisters:" Burgis (Goody) Cook and Ann Johnson of Mc- Dowell, Ky : Edna Meade of Hi Hat, Ky and Hattie Stickrod of Win- chester, Ky. Three brothers Dewey, Leonard and Shortie Mullins, and two sisters Bertha Little and Dorothy Lee Caudill preceded him in death. A host of friends and relatives are left to mourn their loss. He will be missed by those who knew him. I, Elisha Branham would like to write a few words about Bro. Burnis Mullins, a wonderful brother and Deacon of the Pilgrims Home Church. He never gave any trouble to the old church, and it was more of a blessing for him to give than to receive. Bro. Burnis is missed here on earth, but it's Heaven's gain. I want to say to his daughter, Lorene, and son James, grandchildren and relation, may we all meet him in a better land than this. May God bless all of you. Written by Elisha Branham. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ===================================================================</p>
  <p><strong>JOHN TACKETT:&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp; With sadness we will write an obituary of John Tackett. He was born July 3, 1893 and departed this life October 3, 1990, making him 97 years old. He was the son of the late Freel and Sarah Tackett of Folyd County, Kentucky. He was married to the late Margaret Hamilton Tackett. They had nine children. Four children survive him, one daughter Nan Newsome of Grethel, Ky; three sons: Emmitt Tackett of Ivel, Ky; Andy of Albion, Mich; and Bert Tackett of Concord, Mich. He also had twenty-four grandchildren, forty-five great grand-children and twenty-five great-great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his sons Charlie, Kenis, Willie, and Evan Tackett, and one daughter Pearl Hunt; five brothers Emmitt, Joe, Tapley, Bud and Greenberry Tackett; one sister Victoria Tackett. He was a member of the Pilgrims Home Church of Regular Baptist. He was a good humble member of the church, and will be missed by many, but we feel our loss is Heavens gain. He went home to Heaven, a city without pain, without sorrow, and with out death, a city which glories in Jesus for it's King, and angels for it's guards. Death is the separation of the soul from the body. Death is just the gate to everlasting life. The things seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Brother John Tackett will live in many of our hearts, He will be missed, but the memories we all have cannot be erased. We could tell you maby wonderful things about Brother John, but God knows all about them.&nbsp; To know him was to love him. The love we have for him will take us to join him in the morning, the resurrection morning. Written by: his daughter Sister Nan Newsome and Elder James Branham. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ==========================================================</p>
  <p><strong>JOHN B. TACKETT:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> October 29, 1934 - January 6, 1991&nbsp; With tears in our eyes and love in our hearts, we will write this obituary about our daddy. You know anybody can be a father, but it takes someone.. special to be a daddy. Oh we did have a special daddy. We miss him so very much. None of our lives will ever be the same without him, especially that of our precious mommy, who misses him the most. He devoted his life to mommy and his children. Daddy was a coal miner. He worked thirty-two years to provide and take care of his family, always seeing that we had food on the table and clothes to wear. There are ten children, and oh, did he look forward to Sunday when all of us would come to see him and mommy. Although Daddy didn't belong to any church, the the last couple of years of his life, we believe he made peace with God. Every night he would pray, and on the weekends we would get together and just sit and sing. He couldn't read or write, but he could sing. Daddy always sang "I,m Working on a Building for My Lord." He had another song he liked to hear, "Ride out Your Storm", and Billy Jones a Regular Baptist preacher, learned it and he would sing it for Daddy. Daddy did ride out his storm, and he went with Jesus. All we have left is the chance to repent of our sins and be born again to go home with him. May God bless us and show us the way home. If we ask God for help we will receive it. Daddy was the son of the late Berry and Elva Tackett and step-son of the late Mahala Tackett. Left to mourn his loss is his precious wife, Magalene Brown Tackett, whom he meet and married January 6, 1951. Unto this wonderful union were born ten children: Sue, Ricky, Nicky, Gregory, Sheila, Dana, Charlotte, Ken and a set of twins, Kim and Kenin. Also left to mourn this loss are twelve grandchildren three brothers three sisters and a host of friends. Words just can't express how we felt about our Daddy. We will never be able to see him or talk to him here on earth, but there is never a night goes by that we don't pray and hope we will meet him in Heaven someday. May Daddy rest in peace, and God bless our precious Mommy, and all of us, so we may meet him and start a wonderful family in Heaven. There will be a memorial meeting on August 29 and 30, 1992 at the Tackett Fork Family Cemetery at Beaver, Kentucky. Written by: his loving wife and children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ========================================================</p>
  <p><strong>FREEMAN HAMILTON:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> With much sadness and a broken heart. I will try to write an Obituary of my loving husband, Freeman Hamilton. He was born November 29, 1931, at Grethel, Kentucky to Anthony Hamilton and Octava ( Parsons ) Hamilton, and left this world October 17, 1990. On June 6, 1952 he joined in holy wed- lock to Betty Adkins, whom he loved and provided for better than thirty-eight years. Unto this union were born two children, Ronny Hamilton of Romulus, Michigan and Bonnie LeBlanc of Southgate, Michigan. Freeman leave behind to mourn their loss a loving wife Betty, a son Ronny, daughter Bonnie and... three grandchildren, Jesse, Valerie and Michele, whom he loved so dearly. He also leaves to mourn his death a loving father and mother of Harold, Ky. three brothers, Palmer and Eddie both of Harold, Ky, and Gillis of Elkton, Maryland: one sister, Clara Martin of Elkton, Maryland. one brother preceded him in death, Edfert, of Lexington, Kentucky. Freeman loved going to church, even when he didn't feel good. There was always a smile on his face, he would always say how much he enjoyed the preaching and singing. He loved to go back to visit in the mountains and the family reunions. Now the circle has been broken, but what a glorious day that will be when we gather in Heaven for that great reunion, never to separate any more. We miss him so much. Written by: a broken-hearted wife Betty. &nbsp;</p>
