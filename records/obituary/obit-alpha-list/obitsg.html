                <p><strong>GRIGSBY, Elhanan �Pete�</strong> March 19, 1912-March 12, 2002 E.P. Grigsby of Martin, former mayor and civic leader, passed away on March 12, 2002, after an extended illness. He was one week shy of his 90th birthday. He was prominent
                    in local, civic and political activities for nearly 40 years. He served as mayor and city councilman during this time. Elhanan �Pete,� or E.P. as he was known, was one of six children born to Luke Pryor and Eliza Combs Grigsby. He
                    was the last surviving member of that family, being preceded in death by his siblings: Ester G. Brashear, Kermit Grigsby, Anna Mae Beaven, Bailey Grigsby, and Madeline Grisby. He grew up in Perry County, and was a stellar athlete at
                    Hazard High School, earning an athletic scholarship to Morehead State College. While there he played on the football team, and met and married the late Marena Hayes Grigsby, to whom he was married for 62 years. Shortly thereafter,
                    he taught briefly in the Floyd County education system, and later moved to Martin, where he and his wife began a small business. His business interests multiplied, as did his family, and together they had eight children. He was a pioneer
                    in establishing �New� Martin as a viable business center and town. At the time of his first business, main street was a dirt road, and there were little or no business concerns, and a sparse population in the area. He served in the
                    U.S. Navy during World War II, and was honorably discharged. He served as mayor of the City of Martin for 16 years, and an equal amount of time as a city councilman. As mayor, he saw many improvements in the small city, and which on
                    one occasion was identified as the smallest municipality in the United States receiving Federal Aid. He was responsible for getting the first telephone exchange in Martin, and was instrumental in the installation of the modern water
                    purification system. He directed the building of two major housing projects, one is named Grigsby�s Heights, just at the edge of town. His family represented the state of Kentucky in the All American Family Search in Miami Beach, in
                    1957. They were awarded the Eddie Rickenbacher Trophy as the most popular family, elected by the remaining 50 families represented. In recent years he built and owned the Catalina Motel in Lexington, Kentucky. He had numerous business
                    interests in Martin, Kentucky. He is survived by eight children: Pete Grigsby Jr., of McDowell, Kentucky (Phyllis); Charles G. Grigsby, M.D., of Lexington, Kentucky (Sparkle); David Lee Grigsby of Georgetown, Kentucky; Jerry R. Grigsby,
                    DJP, of Nicholasville, Kentucky; Richard Van Grigsby of Lexington, Kentucky (Phyllis); Stephen J. Grigsby of Lexington, Kentucky; Marena G. Evans of Visalia, California (Gary); and Margaret G. Hamilton of Lexington, Kentuc-ky (Frank).
                    In addition, he is survived by 38 grandchildren (two deceased); and 39 great-grandchildren. His life was a testimonial to the virtue of honesty and hard, steady work. He was a wonderful, generous and loving father and grandfather.
                    Love and respect for his life and work will long endure, and his presence will be painfully missed by those who cared and loved him. Funeral services for Elhanan �Pete� Grigsby will be conducted Friday, March 15, 2002, at 11 a.m.,
                    at the Hall Funeral Home Chapel, Martin, Ky. Entombment will follow in the Lexington Cemetery, under the professional care of the Hall Funeral Home. (FCT'S)</p>
