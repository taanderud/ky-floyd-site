	<p>VERGIE CLICK: Grandma was born December 25, 1902 to the late William and Susie Madden Huff. On February 26,
		1919, she was united in marriage to Frank Click. To this union were... born seven children. Poppy and one daughter
		Holly preceded her in death. Left to mourn are, daughters Shirley Huff, Mousie, Ky; Aline Rowe and Genieve Ramey,
		McGuffey, Oh; Wanda Lee Huff, Lexington, Ky; two sisters Allie Moore of Hazard, Ky and Lina Combs of Ohio. 13
		grandchildren, 23 great grand..... children and six great-great grandchildren as well as a host of nieces, nephews
		and
		friends. </p>
	<p>Grandma joined the Old Regular Baptist Church on May 16, 1948 and was baptized by Elder E.H Howard and Elder
		A.L Coburn. Of her nearly 87 years on earth, she liverd 41 1/2 years as a faithful church member. </p>
	<p>As I was lying on my
		bed asking the Lord to help me to think of things to write, I started to remember Grandma was one of the kindest,
		gentlest and most soft-spoken person I have ever known. She never spoke ill of anyone. She was easy going, al- ways
		had time to counsel and advise us children. I remembered as I'm sure the rest of the family does, her going out to
		chop wood milk the cow and feed the chickens. I remembered her siting on the front porchin her rocking chair
		striking
		matches on the nail... head on her chairarm to light her pipe. I remembered the times when her children would gather
		in and cook up a big meal, everybody talking at the same time how the feeling of happiness and love flowed from
		breast
		to..... breast, and how Grandma would always ask to make sure ever body had something to eat. </p>
	<p>I remembered her
		reading the Bible and telling me stories and I remembered how they used to walk from the head of Bear Fork to
		church.
		Now as we come to the end and close the book on Grandma's life memories of her are all that we have left. But most
		of
		all, I know that she would want us to remember that she was a Christian, to love and serve one another, to love and
		serve God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, to prepare to go where I truly believe she has gone. I know
		that she would want the brethren to feel free to preach the word to her family. We all know how she lived and we'll
		miss her very much, but her life has proventhat our loss is Heaven's gain.</p>
	<p> Written by her: grandson and brother in the
		Lord and her great-grandson, Buford Huff and Scotty Francis.
