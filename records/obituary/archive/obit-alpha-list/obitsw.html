                <p><strong>WICKER, Liza Campbell&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Obituary of Liza Campbell Wicker as it appears in the Minutes of the One Hundred and Fifty-Forth Annual Session of the New Salem Association of Old Regular Baptist, 1979. Copy of Original
                    Minutes owned by Terry Triplett. Liza Wicker, the daughter of the late John and Rosa Bigman Campbell was born September 15, 1896 and departed this life on July 6, 1979, making her stay on earth 82 years 9 months and 6 days at the time
                    of her death. In early life she wed to Linville Wicker and unto this union was born 11 Children. Her husband, Linville Wicker, died on December 4, 1962 and also two Children, Maudie and Woodrow preceded her in death. She leaves to
                    mourn her passing, 7 sons; Columbus of Mousie, Kentucky, Carl of Wellville, Ohio, Hawley of Kendallville, Indiana, Ray of Radcliffe, Kentucky, Arnold of Salinesville, Ohio, Orville of Russell Springs, Kentucky, and Freddy of Mousie,
                    Kentucky. Two daughters, Dorthy Hays of Hammondville, Ohio and Delta Ratliff of Hamilton, Ohio. One sister, Martha Griffity, of Monticello, Indiana, 24 Grandchildren and 14 Great-Grandchildren. Many kindred and friends also survive.
                    On October 22, 1950 Sister Liza was baptized into the fellowship of the Ball Branch Old regular Baptist Church by Elder Earl Howard. On the same day Brother Linville was baptized which still lingers in my mind because he had to be
                    lowered into the water on a stretcher. Sister Liza had been in failing health for a long time but as long as she was able she faithfully filled her seat in the church. I feel that both Brother Linville and Sister Liza left a great
                    pattern to follow. They have done as commanded when the Bible says. "Let not the Childers lay up for the parents but the parents for the Children." According to the life this Sister lived, we feel that our loss is heaven's gain. Written
