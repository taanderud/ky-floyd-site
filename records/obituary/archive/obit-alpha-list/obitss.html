                <p><strong>SAMMONS, Ada</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with thoughts of my Saviour on my mind that I will attempt to write part of my obituary. I, Ada Jean Branham Samons, was born June 21, 1952, the daughter of the late Elisha and Goldie McCoy
                    Branham. I have left this earthly home for a beautiful Kingdom, on Friday, October 7, 2005. She is preceded in death by her mother and father; one brother, Russell Branham; three sisters: Alma Branham, Eusla Branham, and Anzie Branham.
                    Her surviving brothers are Kenton Branham, Troy Branham, and Elisha Branham Jr. Her surviving sisters are Marie Tackett and Ann Sigler. Also many nieces and nephews, and one beloved dear friend, Lillian Akers. On August 7, 1971, I
                    was united in marriage to Daniel Lee Samons, my companion of 34 years; not only my husband, but my brother in Christ. Some of my greatest blessings have been hearing him blessed by our Great God to preach his Gospel. To our union was
                    born two daughters: Anzie Samons Thacker and Amy Lee Samons; one son-in-law, who is like my son, Scott Thacker; three precious grandchildren: Kayla Renee Thacker, Byron Scott Thacker, and Jason Daniel Lee Samons. On June 26, 1971,
                    I was born again, a second time, this time as a child of God. This was the greatest day of my life. I have had many blessings, but this was the greatest one of all, and one I can always feel a great place like no other time, when I
                    think back to that day. I was baptized by Elder Johnnie Hall and Elder Junia Damron, and blessed to wash my mother's feet that same day. In 1984, I washed her feet at home, this being her last communion before her death in 1985. I
                    have had many illnesses in this life, but I want all my sickness and sorrow here. I know when I awake in that Great morning, I won't be sick anymore, and will be able to live forever with my Saviour. To my children, grandchildren,
                    and my dear companion, I hate to leave you, but don't cry for me. I will be happy and not hurting anymore. Please keep God's faith, and some day we can meet again, never to be parted no more. Written by: Ada Samons Edited by: Anzie

                    and on to Cuba by boat in the 1930's, with Herman Porter and other friends. Very patriotic, John P., was an U.S. Army veteran and a 50-year Mason, belonging to John W. Hall Lodge No. 950, Martin. He was a faithful University of Kentucky
                    basketball fan, and sports was his passion, especially baseball and fishing. John P. worked for the Turner Elkhorn Mining Company most of his life, and coal mining was more than just an occupation to him. He rode around in his truck
                    with a sign saying "I'm a coal miner, and proud of it." His family used to tease him about mining coal in his sleep. He was a part of many, many winning teams for Turner Elkhorn in the First Aid Mining competitions. He was so very
                    happy to have been born in the USA, and raised in eastern Kentucky, surrounded by the mountains that were so dear to him, and that he knew so well. Funeral services were conducted Tuesday, June 7, at 11 a.m., at Hall Funeral Home,

                <p><strong>SCOTT, Andy&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Obituary of Andy Scott as found in the Minutes of the One Hundred and Sixty-Eighth Annual Session of The New Salem Association of Old Regular Baptist 1993. Original copy in the possession Terry
                    Triplett. Obituary of Andy Scott, Written by his son-in-law Terry Triplett It is with a heavy heart that I write the obituary of my Father-in-law Andy Scott. Andy was born on Stone Coal Creek, in Garrett, Kentucky (Floyd County) on
                    May 18, 1912 to Jefferson Scott and Mary Ward Scott, and passed this life on August 1, 1993 making his stay on earth 81 years, 2 months and 14 days. Early in life he met and married Callie Hale, who proceeded him in death, and to this
                    union was born 13 children. Two children, Elizabeth Scott and Dan Scott also preceded him in death. Left to mourn his passing are 4 sons, Earnest Scott, Randolph Scott, Frank Scott and Rodney Scott. Seven daughters, Wanda Lee Rister,
                    Imolene Hicks, Irene Butcher Talaska, Linda Faye Christain, Sallie May Pratt, Mattie Ruth Triplett and Mary Sue Wicker. 46 Grand Children, 37 Great Grand Children, 2 Great Great Grand Children and many many friends. Andy was a hard
                    worker all his life. He Retired from two unions, the UMWA (united mine workers of America) and the Laborers International Union. He was proud to be a union worker for over 50 years. In his retirement he loved hunting and fishing and
                    enjoyed life to it's fullest. Andy never joined a church, but attended Stone Coal Old Regular Baptist Church regularly and felt that it was his home. Four days before Andy died Elder Ed Moore said he had a dream about Andy. He said
                    in his dream he and Andy were cutting down a tree. Ed said that the tree was made of glass and it was sparkling like crystal. Ed said in his dream that they cut the tree down and he turned to see Andy and he was climbing up a limb
                    like a squirrel and disappeared in a cloud. Ed said Andy never looked back. On the morning of the day Andy passed away, I think he knew he was dying, but I never saw any fear in his eyes. As the day grew longer and he grew weaker,
                    his love for his family and friends grew stronger. When the time came, he just went to sleep. In my heart I feel that a band of Angels was around his bed to take him home. The Bible says that a tree is known by the fruit it bears.
                    I've been a member of Andy's family for 23 years, Andy's fruit was good.&nbsp; Submitted by trip608@msn.com</p>

                    Manton, Kentucky. She entered into eternal rest on Easter Sunday, March 30, 1986, making her stay on earth a little over 69 years. In early life mom met, loved and married Andy Scott, and to this union thirteen children were born (two
                    of whom preceded Mom in death). Left to mourn her passing are her companion, Andy; four sons; Ernest of Romulus, Mich., Randolph of Westland, Mich, Frank and Rodney, both of Garrett, Kentucky; seven daughters; Wanda Rister, Sally Pratt

                    eighteen Great-Grandchildren, two brothers and a sister. Mom was a kind and Loving person, she was always thinking of us children and our needs. In our times of hardships, mom would always want to know if we needed help from her and
                    dad. She didn't want us to do without the things we needed. I've always thought my parents were the best anybody could have. We didn't have a lot of money, but we had and still have plenty of love for each other. I've heard Elder Burt
                    Howard say so many times around deaths and funerals that if a person has the faith and believes, God will show them that there loved one is at rest. I've had such beautiful dreams about my Mother, and I belive with all my heart that
                    she's at rest. She's a sleep in Jesus, waiting for that trumpet to sound so she can go home, where there will be no more sickness and suffering. Our family sends out our thanks and love to all the beautiful people who helped us in
                    our time of need. A special thanks to Brother Morris Wicker and Brother Jerry Manns; they stood by our family all the way. God bless both of you. I write this in Loving memory of my precious mother, whom I will never forget as long
