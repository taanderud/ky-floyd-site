  <p><strong>CONN, Hiram , Sr.,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Was born July 14, 1850 and departed this life September 27th, 1939, at the age of 89 years, 7 months, 13 days. He was born in Floyd County and resided within a few miles of the same place all of his life. At about the age of 19 years he was married to Ellen Crum, and to that union were born 12 children, 8 boys and 4 girls. Five boys, Frank, Jim, Ike, Dave, and Lee and one daughter, Nella Spears, are still living. On the 23rd day of August, 1893, the 'home circle' was broken by the death of Uncle Hi's first wife. On the 23rd of November, 1893, he was united in marriage with Catherine Howell and to that union were born two boys and three girls, all of whom still survive except one daughter, Helen, who was killed by a train May 25, 1929 while trying to rescue her child. Charley, Henry, Nicy, and Myrtle are left to mourn the loss of a departed father. On the 20th day of January, 1918, the death angel again visited that happy home and took from his embrace his second companion. On the 7th day of June, 1919, he was united in marriage to Jennie B. Adkins, who for more than 19 years cared for and administered to his every want and on September 7, 1938, she too was called away. Uncle Hi leaves 11 children, 122 grandchildren, 281 great-grandchildren and 61 great-great-grandchildren. A total of 475. Uncle Hi always lived a quite and peaceable life and was more than forty years ago he joined the Old Regular Baptist Church and has lived a devoted Christian life since. During his stay on earth he enjoyed excellent health and until he was more than 80 years of age was able to ride long distances to his church. On the 12th day of July, 1939, he had a stroke of paralysis, which rendered him speechless and almost helpless. He would often make an effort to talk to his children who assembled around his bedside and these is no doubt in the writer's mind but what he was trying to counsel them, or tell them that his path was clear and he would soon join those loved ones gone on before. Every care was administered by his children who were ever by his bedside. It is our humble opinion that the Lord will bless and reward children who take such kind and tender care of father as those have, especially Myrtle and John S., who were never too tired or sleepy to administer to his every want, not only them but others also. Children, father is gone, cannot be here with you again, but you know the life he would have you live, that you may meet him over there, and together ever be with the Lord.
