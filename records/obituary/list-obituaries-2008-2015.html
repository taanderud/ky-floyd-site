                    <p><strong>STOVER, Dorothy Conley</strong> Age 72, completed her journey on this planet and left for
                        her heavenly reward this 16th day of June, in the year of our Lord 2008. She was a devoted
                        member of the First United Methodist Church in Prestonsburg. Dorothy Ann was born on December
                        6th, 1935, in Williamson, West Virginia. She was known to all as a kind and gentle soul with
                        just a dash of mischievous humor. She could always be counted for a kind word or helping hand to
                        anyone, whether it be friend, family member, or even a stranger. Her greatest love in life was
                        her husband, Jess; together they have set a loving example of what a life lived in love, and
                        with a love of Christ should be. She graduated from West Virginia Tech in 1958, with a Bachelor
                        of Arts in Journalism. In her time on this earth she was an educator, entrepreneur, and
                        homemaker. Dorothy was a former president of the Highlands Regional Medical Center Auxiliary,
                        and served willingly in other church, civic and social organizations. Dorothy was preceded in
                        death by her parents: George Thomas and Lola Davis Conley. We are bereaved, but we are comforted
                        in knowing that Dorothy is with Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in Heaven. We cannot help but
                        praise him for the precious gift that was her life. She is survived by her beloved husband,
                        Jess; a daughter, Leann (Robert) Rodgers; a son, Tommy; and three grandchildren: Sarah, Katie,
                        and Thomas Rodgers of Frankfort, Kentucky. She is also survived by her sister, Betty Conley
                        Campbell of Yadkinville, North Carolina; and many beloved nieces and nephews. Pallbearers are:

                        needed. She never wanted anyone to know how sick she really was or how much pain she was really
                        in. She refused to give in to her illness, and she amazed us all with her strength. Faye was a
                        loving wife, mother, grandmother and great grandmother. Each day with her here was truly a
                        blessing for us all. She was dedicated to her family and we always came first and she last. She
                        loved to cook for her family, from every day meals to the most hectic holiday meals. She filled
                        our hearts and our lives with love, joy, laughter, and filled our minds with endless sweet
                        memories. Remember not her death, but her life and her strong will and determination to beat the
                        odds. We will always love you and miss you. (HFH)

                        World War II, he was recognized as a successful &apos;Medic&apos; and was honorably discharged
                        from the Medical Department of the United States Army in 1945. These services were rendered at
                        the 110th Station Hospital. Shortly after his return, he married Helen Virginia Steffey and
