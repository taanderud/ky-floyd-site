                        her heavenly reward this 16th day of June, in the year of our Lord 2008. She was a devoted
                        member of the First United Methodist Church in Prestonsburg. Dorothy Ann was born on December
                        6th, 1935, in Williamson, West Virginia. She was known to all as a kind and gentle soul with
                        just a dash of mischievous humor. She could always be counted for a kind word or helping hand to
                        anyone, whether it be friend, family member, or even a stranger. Her greatest love in life was
                        her husband, Jess; together they have set a loving example of what a life lived in love, and
                        with a love of Christ should be. She graduated from West Virginia Tech in 1958, with a Bachelor
                        of Arts in Journalism. In her time on this earth she was an educator, entrepreneur, and
                        homemaker. Dorothy was a former president of the Highlands Regional Medical Center Auxiliary,
                        and served willingly in other church, civic and social organizations. Dorothy was preceded in
                        death by her parents: George Thomas and Lola Davis Conley. We are bereaved, but we are comforted
                        in knowing that Dorothy is with Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in Heaven. We cannot help but
                        praise him for the precious gift that was her life. She is survived by her beloved husband,
                        Jess; a daughter, Leann (Robert) Rodgers; a son, Tommy; and three grandchildren: Sarah, Katie,
                        and Thomas Rodgers of Frankfort, Kentucky. She is also survived by her sister, Betty Conley
                        Campbell of Yadkinville, North Carolina; and many beloved nieces and nephews. Pallbearers are:

                        almost 20 years, Her strong will and determination to keep going is what we will remember most.
                        She kept on going and was strong for all of us, because that's what we needed. She never wanted
                        anyone to know how sick she really was or how much pain she was really in. She refused to give
                        in to her illness, and she amazed us all with her strength. Faye was a loving wife, mother,
                        grandmother and great grandmother. Each day with her here was truly a blessing for us all. She
                        was dedicated to her family and we always came first and she last. She loved to cook for her
                        family, from every day meals to the most hectic holiday meals. She filled our hearts and our
                        lives with love, joy, laughter, and filled our minds with endless sweet memories. Remember not
                        her death, but her life and her strong will and determination to beat the odds. We will always
                        love you and miss you. (HFH)

                        World War II, he was recognized as a successful &apos;Medic&apos; and was honorably discharged
                        from the Medical Department of the United States Army in 1945. These services were rendered at
                        the 110th Station Hospital. Shortly after his return, he married Helen Virginia Steffey and

                        and remained married to Helen 59 plus years. He followed his daughter&apos;s successful music
                        career, until poor health prevented him from doing so. Many people will remember George from the
