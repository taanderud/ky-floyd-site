About the year 1853 father first married Anna Blankenship, and unto them was born 7 children. Father enlisted in the Civil War in the year 1862, and was mustered out April 15, 1865. After his first wife died, he married Martha Balden, about the year 1872, and as a result of this happy union, to them was born 11 children, of whom two are dead, one of whom belonged to the Old Regular Baptist Church when she died. Father was sick from August to Dec. 11, 1907. He professed a hope in Christ and shouted and praised God, and charged his children to have no doubts about his eternal salvation for when I leave here I am going home to Glory, and said: "Children, I heard the prettiest singing the other night. I saw Christ coming with His angels from every direction in the brightest cloud I ever saw. Children, I could tell your mother's voice from all the rest, she was in the lead. They were singing the song of Moses and the Lamb by and by. Me and my company crossed and started meeting them, singing the same song.&nbsp;&nbsp; Composed by Mahala Jones August 1, 1908&nbsp; Submitted by <a href="mailto:mjt9462@hotmail.com">Martha Jones Tufts</a>&nbsp; From Minutes of the Old Regular Baptist</p>

        <p><strong>JONES, Martha</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; To the memory of a dear mother, it is so sad with me that I can hardly bear to write a sketch of the life of my dear mother who has gone home to Glory to reign with Christ. Mother was born about March, 1850, and was married to Ambrose Jones at the age of 22 years. She was the mother of 11 children of the 18 of father's family; She was a true and gentle mother until her death. Two of her children has professed a hope in Christ. Mother has a severe stroke of paralysis May 16, 1905. She lay 4 months and 7 days before she professed a hope in Christ and called on the elders John M. Akers and C. C. Mitchell to come and hold meeting at her house, who at the close of the service published an open door for the reception of members by experience and baptism, when mother gave her hand and told them what good things the Lord had done for the soul. I was present at the time she professed a hope, she told them she wanted to go down into the water and be burried with Christ in baptism. They carried mother on a chair to the water side, she went into the water praising God and came up out of the water and shouted praise to the Lord at the top of her voice. It was a great comfort to her insomuch that when any of the brethren and sisters would come in to see her and try to comfort her in her afflictions she would shout and rejoice, and her children, when they would start for home, Mother would give them her hand and bid them farewell. Mother left three little orphans behind to mourn her loss with the rest of us, one afflicted with white swelling. Mother lived 13 months and 20 days in the fellowship of the church, before God called her home.&nbsp;&nbsp; Composed by Mahala Jones August 1, 1908&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submitted by <a href="mailto:mjt9462@hotmail.com">Martha Jones Tufts</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Minutes of the Old Regular Baptist</p>
