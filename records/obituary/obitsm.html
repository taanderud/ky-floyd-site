                    sports in the 15th region for more than 30 years. He was a sports reporter for the Louisville Courier-Journal, the Lexington Herald-Leader, the Ashland Daily Indepen-dent, and the Huntington Herald-Dispatch. Earl Ruby and Earl Cox,
                    former sports writers for the Louisville Courier-Journal, were his close friends. He graduated from Morehead State University, and while there served as the schools sports information director. He later coached several sports at a

                    Gordon has left an unparalleled legacy in eastern Kentucky sports, having labled Kelly Coleman �King Kelly Coleman,� the greatest player ever to come out of eastern Kentucky. Numerous journalists doing research on books about events
                    in eastern Kentucky, visited his home for numerous facts and information. He prided himself with great memory, and was quoted in numerous books. Gordon had received his Ph.D in journalism from the University of Florida. He loved eastern
                    Kentucky and its people, and politicians were always at his door. The world is a better place because of Gordon. He has gone to a better place, but he will never be forgotten. Funeral services for Gordon Moore will be conducted Thursday,

                <p><strong>MOORE, Monroe</strong>&nbsp; Obituary of Monroe Moore as found in the Minutes of the One Hundred and Thirty-Six Annual Session of The New Salem Association of Old Regular Baptist 1961. Original copy in the possession Terry Triplett.
                    With deep regrets and much humbleness I'll try to write an obituary of our good Brother, to-wit Bro. Monroe Moore. He was born April 29, 1904 and departed this life November 29, 1960. He was the son of Richard and Hannah Gayheart Moore.
                    He was married to Nannie Blankenship March 28, 1923 and to this union was born thirteen children. Three children preceded him in death. Which leaves ten children and a heart-broken wife to mourn their loss. I want to tell his wife
                    and children that your loss is heavens gain. Brother Moore joined the Beaver Church of Old Regular Baptist on October 15, 1932, was baptized by Elder Tom Mosley. He served the Beaver Church as Deacon and Clerk for many years. There
                    are many wonderful things I could say about Brother Moore. He was faithful to his duty to the church when he didn't feel good and wasn't able to, but he always said God will make a way if we just trust Him. Brother Moore always stood
                    for a clean Church and believed in keeping order in the house of the Lord. The Beaver Church has lost a good soldier but God knows best. We feel he fought a good fight, he kept the faith so we feel he is resting from his labor and
                    when the Lord comes riding on the cloud of Glory, that Brother Moore will receive his reward, that I've heard him talk so muck about. I want to say to his children if you want to see your Dad you'll have to fall out with sin and repent
                    for the sin you have all ready committed. Look to the Lord and he will lead you. Let Brother Moore's God be your God. May the life of Brother Moore remain in your mind. To sister Moore, pray on and it won't be long until we'll meet
                    Brother Moore. Written by a Brother in the Lord, who is trying to carry on the work that Brother Moore rest from Brother Glenn Pack. Submitted by <a href="mailto:trip608@msn.com">trip608@msn.com</a></p>
