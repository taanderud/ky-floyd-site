                        Delcie Napier Gayheart passed away Wednesday, September 1, 2004 at Our Lady of the Way Hospital in Martin, Kentucky. She was born September 24, 1921 at Handshoe, KY, the daughter of the late Alvin and Rhoda Moore Napier. Her husband of fifty-five years, Fletcher as well as her sisters, Ruby Richter and Bertha Mae Napier, also preceded her in death.
                        <p>Delcie is survived by her brother, Clarence Edward Napier of Louisville, KY, her three children, Ruby Pernot of Centralia, Illinois; Rhoda Lanman of Louisville, KY; Fletcher Gayheart Jr. of Eastern, KY; her three grandchildren, Tara Pernot of Temecula, California, Dane Pernot of San Diego, California; Jason Gayheart of LaGrange, KY and her great-grandson Jason Alexander Gayheart of LaGrange.</p>
                        <p>Her nieces, Bridgett Hall, Linda Victor, Sandra Nelson and her nephew, Eddie Napier and their children, with whom she shared a very special relationship, also survive her.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Gayheart was a proud alumnus of Garrett High School, attending all of the reunions except this year due to her illness. She completed a business course at Mayo State Vocational School and took college classes from Pikeville College. Most of her life she was a homemaker, but was employed in the family grocery and service station for several years, worked for the school system as an assistant in the Head Start Program, and worked in a family dry-cleaning business.</p>
                        <p>She was very active in the Maytown Methodist Church, the 4-H, the Homemakers Club, and other activities in which her children participated. After her children left home, she became active in TOPS, took swimming lessons, and joined the Eastern Star chapter at Martin. She served as Worthy Matron and traveled extensively to other chapter meetings as well as the annual grand chapter meeting.</p>
                        <p>The family asks that expressions of sympathy be made through donations to her church, Graceway United Methodist Church of Langley, KY or to the American Cancer Society.</p>
