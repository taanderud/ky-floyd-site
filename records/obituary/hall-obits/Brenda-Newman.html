                        Ky. <strong>Brenda Lou Salyers Newman</strong> Brenda Lou Salyers Newman, passed away May 21,
                        2006, at Nottingham City Hospital in England after a long illness. Brenda was born and raised at
                        Eastern, Ky. and graduated from Maytown High School. She graduated from Berea College in 1963
                        with a Bachelor of Science in Home Economics and went on to the U.S. Army where she achieved the
                        rank of Captain. After leaving the Army, she continued her education at the University of
                        Tennessee at Knoxville where she received her Masters Degre. This is where she met her future
                        husband, Dr. Geoffrey Newman. She was a long time resident of Derby, England and a member of the
                        Women�s Institute (a voluntary organization which provides support for many community issues in
                        the UK). Brenda will be greatly missed by many people who loved her Brenda and her husband
                        Geoffrey came back often to Kentucky and Tennessee areas to visit family, friends and the
                        Appalachian hills they loved so well. Her generosity, support and humor were great gifts she
                        shared with everyone. Even though it has been almost a year since we lost her, we will continue
                        to keep her memory strong in our hearts. Brenda was preceded in death by her Father, Hudson
                        Salyers and Mother, Goldia Martin Salyers and Brother, Delbert Glen Salyers. She is survived by:
                        Her Husband of over 37 years, Dr. Geoffrey Newman, Two Sisters, Reba (Glenn) McClanan of
                        Virginia Beach, VA., and Velinda Salyers of Houston, TX. Three Brothers, Keith Salyers, Bruce
                        Salyers and Colby Salyers all of Eastern, KY., Two Nephews, Martin (Liz) McClanan of San
                        Fancisco, CA., and Glenn McClanan, Jr. of Los Angeles, Calif. And One Niece, Anne McClanan of
                        Portland, Oregon. She is also survived by two grand nephews and one grand niece. Brenda funeral
                        in England last year was attended by many of her friends and family. Brenda�s ashes have been
                        brought home to Kentucky by her husband Geoff, and we would welcome all friends and family to
                        attend. The family will have a Graveside ceremony at the Martin Cemetery at Eastern, Ky. on
                        Saturday, May 12, 2007 at 2:00 P.M. to inter her ashes. Arrangements by Hall Funeral Home of
