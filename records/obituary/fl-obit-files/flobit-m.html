                        pool, bowling, and just seeing people have a good time. The family extends deep appreciation to
                        friends, Brenda Aviles, Lee Burgess, Trudy Helton, Louise Green, and Gladys Jackson, who
                        unselfishly were at Effie's side during her battle with cancer. The family extends a special
                        thank-you to the Lourdes Hospice caregivers, especially Debbie, Elizabeth, Susan and Zelma, for
                        their professionalism as Effie's final days approached. In addition, a warm thank-you is

                        Daily Indepen-dent, and the Huntington Herald-Dispatch. Earl Ruby and Earl Cox, former sports
                        writers for the Louisville Courier-Journal, were his close friends. He graduated from Morehead
                        State University, and while there served as the schools sports information director. He later
                        coached several sports at a high school in Woodstock, Ohio, and became an educator. He served as
                        president of the Morehead University Alumni Association, and was enshrined in the Morehead State
                        University "Hall of Fame," a few years later. Gordon, in earlier years, loved to entertain at
                        his "Red Moore Lodge" at Jenny Wiley Lake. He was an avid fisherman all his life. He also was
                        well-known for his production of a variety of hot peppers and hot cheese, which he shared with
                        many of his friends. Gordon has left an unparalleled legacy in eastern Kentucky sports, having
                        labled Kelly Coleman "King Kelly Coleman," the greatest player ever to come out of eastern
                        Kentucky. Numerous journalists doing research on books about events in eastern Kentucky, visited
                        his home for numerous facts and information. He prided himself with great memory, and was quoted
                        in numerous books. Gordon had received his Ph.D in journalism from the University of Florida. He
                        loved eastern Kentucky and its people, and politicians were always at his door. The world is a
                        better place because of Gordon. He has gone to a better place, but he will never be forgotten.

                        Original copy in the possession Terry Triplett. With deep regrets and much humbleness I'll try
                        to write an obituary of our good Brother, to-wit Bro. Monroe Moore. He was born April 29, 1904
                        and departed this life November 29, 1960. He was the son of Richard and Hannah Gayheart Moore.
                        He was married to Nannie Blankenship March 28, 1923 and to this union was born thirteen
                        children. Three children preceded him in death. Which leaves ten children and a heart-broken
                        wife to mourn their loss. I want to tell his wife and children that your loss is heavens gain.
                        Brother Moore joined the Beaver Church of Old Regular Baptist on October 15, 1932, was baptized
                        by Elder Tom Mosley. He served the Beaver Church as Deacon and Clerk for many years. There are
                        many wonderful things I could say about Brother Moore. He was faithful to his duty to the church
                        when he didn't feel good and wasn't able to, but he always said God will make a way if we just
                        trust Him. Brother Moore always stood for a clean Church and believed in keeping order in the
                        house of the Lord. The Beaver Church has lost a good soldier but God knows best. We feel he
                        fought a good fight, he kept the faith so we feel he is resting from his labor and when the Lord
                        comes riding on the cloud of Glory, that Brother Moore will receive his reward, that I've heard
                        him talk so muck about. I want to say to his children if you want to see your Dad you'll have to
                        fall out with sin and repent for the sin you have all ready committed. Look to the Lord and he
                        will lead you. Let Brother Moore's God be your God. May the life of Brother Moore remain in your
                        mind. To sister Moore, pray on and it won't be long until we'll meet Brother Moore. Written by a
                        Brother in the Lord, who is trying to carry on the work that Brother Moore rest from Brother
