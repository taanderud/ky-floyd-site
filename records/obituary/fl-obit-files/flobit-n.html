                        Economics and went on to the U.S. Army where she achieved the rank of Captain. After leaving the

                        many people who loved her Brenda and her husband Geoffrey came back often to Kentucky and
                        Tennessee areas to visit family, friends and the Appalachian hills they loved so well. Her
                        generosity, support and humor were great gifts she shared with everyone. Even though it has been
                        almost a year since we lost her, we will continue to keep her memory strong in our hearts.
                        Brenda was preceded in death by her Father, Hudson Salyers and Mother, Goldia Martin Salyers and
                        Brother, Delbert Glen Salyers. She is survived by: Her Husband of over 37 years, Dr. Geoffrey

                        we would welcome all friends and family to attend. The family will have a Graveside ceremony at
                        the Martin Cemetery at Eastern, Ky. on Saturday, May 12, 2007 at 2:00 P.M. to inter her ashes.
