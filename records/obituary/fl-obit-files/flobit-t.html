                    <p><strong>TRIPLETT, Audrey Hunter</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Obituary of Audrey Hunter Triplett as found
                        in the Minutes of the One Hundred and Sixty-Ninth Annual Session of The New Salem Association of
                        Old Regular Baptist 1994. Original copy in the possession Terry Triplett. Audrey Hunter Triplett
                        I attempt to write an obituary of our beloved mother, Audrey Hunter Triplett. Mommy was born
                        September 26, 1930 to Simon Hunter and Alice Moore Hunter. On February 3, 1951 she married Elva
                        Triplett. Mommy and Daddy raised 4 Children, Terry Wayne Triplett of Garrett, Kentucky, Michael
                        Triplett of Angola, Indiana, Erma Caudill of Georgetown, Kentucky and Katherin Ann Triplett of
                        Georgetown , Kentucky. Time nor space will allow me to tell what a wonderful person our mother
                        was. Everyone who knew her loved her and many people have told us how much they envied us having
                        a mother like her. We have no bad memories of mommy, only good ones. She loved all of her
                        children equally and unconditionally and taught us to love in the same manner. I was fortunate
                        enough to have spent more time with mommy than my sister and brothers and I feel I lost my best
                        friend as well as my mother. Mommy and daddy have 9 Grandchildren, 2 step-Grandchildren and 4
                        Great-Grandchildren who mourn her as greatly as her own children. She was a very special
                        grandmother, never to tired to get down in the floor to play with them or listen to their
                        problems. I do belive they loved mommy as much as they loved their own mothers. Our home was
                        always a happy place to gather because mommy always turned everything into a good time. On March
                        9, 1994 our home fell silent, never to be the same again. It is hard to belive how losing her
                        could change so many lives. Sometimes it feel too unbearable to go on. In addition to her
                        Loving, heart broken husband, Elva, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she leaves
                        to grieve 3 brothers and 5 sisters. All we can do is try to be the people mommy believed we
                        could be and live in hope of seeing her beautiful smiling face again Written by Her forever

                        Great Grandchildren. Elva served in the Army from 1950 to 1952 in Washington D.C. where he was
                        part of the Honor Guard for President Harry Truman. A fact that he was very proud of and spoke
                        of often. After his discharge from the Army he went to Newport News Virginia and got a job as a
                        welder in the Shipyard. He worked there for about 14 years until he decided to come home to
                        Knott County and build a home and raise his Family. He worked as a coal miner until 1976 when he
                        became disabled to work due to Black Lung and was told to quit. In 1979 Dr. Grady Stumbo told
                        Dad that he had lung cancer and that he needed to go to Lexington to see a lung specialist for a
                        second opinion. Dad went to Lexington and after being x-rayed by the Doctor was told to report
                        back to his doctor for the results. When he went back to Dr. Stumbo he was told that he had a
                        tumor about the size of an orange on his lung and that both Doctors agreed that he was terminal
                        and only had about 6 weeks to live. The Bible says, " if you have faith the size of a mustard
                        seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing
                        will be impossible for you." Dad went to Elder Burton Howard, of the Old Regular Baptist faith,
                        and ask Burt to "Lay Hands on him" and Burt did. A short time later Dad went back to Dr. Stumbo
                        and said "Take another picture" and Dr. Stumbo said "Elva, there's no need, it's not going to
                        get better" and Dad said "I went and had Burt Howard lay hands on me and I'm cured" He didn't
                        say I think I'm cured he said I'm cured. Dr. Stumbo said he sounded so convinced that he did the
                        X-ray, and found that the tumor that was there only a couple of weeks ago was gone. No scar no
                        trace. Dr. Stumbo still carries those x-rays around with him. He told us that every Doctors
                        convention he goes to he shows those x-rays he said as many as a thousand Doctors have seen them
                        and they all say the same thing, "it's not possible, it must be two different men" Dr. Stumbo
                        said if he hadn't taken the x-rays himself he wouldn't believe it either. God gave dad 25 years
                        for some purpose I don't know what, maybe so that Dr. Stumbo could carry those x-rays around and
                        show what faith can do, I don't know? I know that dad was a changed man. About a month before
                        Dad died Reverend Bud Wicker came to the hospital to see dad and to talk to him. Bud told dad
                        that he had to ask God to forgive his sins if he wanted to go to Heaven and dad said he knew
                        that. Two weeks ago on Saturday Dads brother Carson and I ask dad if he had ask God to forgive
                        his sins and He told us that he had. Dad was never baptized in water but I believe he did get
                        what he needed to get to Heaven. Dad was a humble man and always gave good counsel to his
                        children, his brothers, and his sisters. If we learned anything from him it should have been
                        "Have Faith in God". Written by his Children Submitted by trip608@msn.com</p>
