                    <p>Obituary of Audrey Hunter Triplett as found in the Minutes of the One Hundred and Sixty-Ninth
                        Annual Session of The New Salem Association of Old Regular Baptist 1994. Original copy in the
                        possession Terry Triplett. Audrey Hunter Triplett I attempt to write an obituary of our beloved
                        mother, Audrey Hunter Triplett. Mommy was born September 26, 1930 to Simon Hunter and Alice
                        Moore Hunter. On February 3, 1951 she married Elva Triplett. Mommy and Daddy raised 4 Children,
                        Terry Wayne Triplett of Garrett, Kentucky, Michael Triplett of Angola, Indiana, Erma Caudill of
                        Georgetown, Kentucky and Katherin Ann Triplett of Georgetown , Kentucky. Time nor space will
                        allow me to tell what a wonderful person our mother was. Everyone who knew her loved her and
                        many people have told us how much they envied us having a mother like her. We have no bad
                        memories of mommy, only good ones. She loved all of her children equally and unconditionally and
                        taught us to love in the same manner. I was fortunate enough to have spent more time with mommy
                        than my sister and brothers and I feel I lost my best friend as well as my mother. Mommy and
                        daddy have 9 Grandchildren, 2 step-Grandchildren and 4 Great-Grandchildren who mourn her as
                        greatly as her own children. She was a very special grandmother, never to tired to get down in
                        the floor to play with them or listen to their problems. I do belive they loved mommy as much as
                        they loved their own mothers. Our home was always a happy place to gather because mommy always
                        turned everything into a good time. On March 9, 1994 our home fell silent, never to be the same
                        again. It is hard to belive how losing her could change so many lives. Sometimes it feel too
                        unbearable to go on. In addition to her Loving, heart broken husband, Elva, children,
                        grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she leaves to grieve 3 brothers and 5 sisters. All we can
                        do is try to be the people mommy believed we could be and live in hope of seeing her beautiful

                        death by his wife of 43 years Audrey, 2 brothers Kelly Triplett and Jimmy Triplett. He is
                        survived by his 4 Children Terry, Michael, Erma and Kathy, 4 Brothers Carson Triplett, Kennel

                        Minnie Davis, 12 Grandchildren and 10 Great Grandchildren. Elva served in the Army from 1950 to
                        1952 in Washington D.C. where he was part of the Honor Guard for President Harry Truman. A fact
                        that he was very proud of and spoke of often. After his discharge from the Army he went to
                        Newport News Virginia and got a job as a welder in the Shipyard. He worked there for about 14
                        years until he decided to come home to Knott County and build a home and raise his Family. He
                        worked as a coal miner until 1976 when he became disabled to work due to Black Lung and was told
                        to quit. In 1979 Dr. Grady Stumbo told Dad that he had lung cancer and that he needed to go to
                        Lexington to see a lung specialist for a second opinion. Dad went to Lexington and after being
                        x-rayed by the Doctor was told to report back to his doctor for the results. When he went back
                        to Dr. Stumbo he was told that he had a tumor about the size of an orange on his lung and that
                        both Doctors agreed that he was terminal and only had about 6 weeks to live. The Bible says, "
                        if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to
                        there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you." Dad went to Elder Burton
                        Howard, of the Old Regular Baptist faith, and ask Burt to "Lay Hands on him" and Burt did. A
                        short time later Dad went back to Dr. Stumbo and said "Take another picture" and Dr. Stumbo said
                        "Elva, there's no need, it's not going to get better" and Dad said "I went and had Burt Howard
                        lay hands on me and I'm cured" He didn't say I think I'm cured he said I'm cured. Dr. Stumbo
                        said he sounded so convinced that he did the X-ray, and found that the tumor that was there only
                        a couple of weeks ago was gone. No scar no trace. Dr. Stumbo still carries those x-rays around
                        with him. He told us that every Doctors convention he goes to he shows those x-rays he said as
                        many as a thousand Doctors have seen them and they all say the same thing, "it's not possible,
                        it must be two different men" Dr. Stumbo said if he hadn't taken the x-rays himself he wouldn't
                        believe it either. God gave dad 25 years for some purpose I don't know what, maybe so that Dr.
                        Stumbo could carry those x-rays around and show what faith can do, I don't know? I know that dad
                        was a changed man. About a month before Dad died Reverend Bud Wicker came to the hospital to see
                        dad and to talk to him. Bud told dad that he had to ask God to forgive his sins if he wanted to
                        go to Heaven and dad said he knew that. Two weeks ago on Saturday Dads brother Carson and I ask
                        dad if he had ask God to forgive his sins and He told us that he had. Dad was never baptized in
                        water but I believe he did get what he needed to get to Heaven. Dad was a humble man and always
                        gave good counsel to his children, his brothers, and his sisters. If we learned anything from
                        him it should have been "Have Faith in God". Written by his Children Submitted by
