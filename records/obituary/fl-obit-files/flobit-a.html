                        many special friends. She enjoyed cooking, helping with church bazaars, having family dinners
                        and get-togethers, sewing, and was a gifted quiltmaker. She also loved participating in her
                        homemaker�s club and working at the county fair. Her greatest asset was making you feel
                        comfortable in her home, the great dinners she hosted and the pleasure she derived from having
                        you there. Those who were touched by Josephine�s life will always remember her. (FCT'S)</p>
