                        the road from the Stumbo Memorial Hospital at Lackey, Kentucky. This was during the late 1930's
                        with her first husband , Bill Wicker, where he was shot and killed in 1940. Fannie later married

                        helping hand and open heart to her many friends in the area. Fannie, divorced from Walter Reams,

                        Little Ruth congregation met at Fannie's bedside and held their services there in her daughter's
                        home . Following this meeting, she declared to everyone that she was "ready to go home," and a
                        few days later she did that. In the picture with her is her 5-year-old great-grandson, Kendal l
                        Jason Coffman, to whom she was totally devoted and loved dearly. He lived next door and was the
                        last person with whom Fannie spoke, just prior to her falling into a coma and passing on. She is
                        greatly missed and still loved by family and many friends. Written by daughter and son-in-law,
