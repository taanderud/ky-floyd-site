                    <p><strong>GRIGSBY, Elhanan �Pete�</strong> March 19, 1912-March 12, 2002 E.P. Grigsby of Martin,
                        former mayor and civic leader, passed away on March 12, 2002, after an extended illness. He was
                        one week shy of his 90th birthday. He was prominent in local, civic and political activities for
                        nearly 40 years. He served as mayor and city councilman during this time. Elhanan �Pete,� or
                        E.P. as he was known, was one of six children born to Luke Pryor and Eliza Combs Grigsby. He was
                        the last surviving member of that family, being preceded in death by his siblings: Ester G.
                        Brashear, Kermit Grigsby, Anna Mae Beaven, Bailey Grigsby, and Madeline Grisby. He grew up in
                        Perry County, and was a stellar athlete at Hazard High School, earning an athletic scholarship
                        to Morehead State College. While there he played on the football team, and met and married the
                        late Marena Hayes Grigsby, to whom he was married for 62 years. Shortly thereafter, he taught
                        briefly in the Floyd County education system, and later moved to Martin, where he and his wife
                        began a small business. His business interests multiplied, as did his family, and together they
                        had eight children. He was a pioneer in establishing �New� Martin as a viable business center
                        and town. At the time of his first business, main street was a dirt road, and there were little
                        or no business concerns, and a sparse population in the area. He served in the U.S. Navy during
                        World War II, and was honorably discharged. He served as mayor of the City of Martin for 16
                        years, and an equal amount of time as a city councilman. As mayor, he saw many improvements in
                        the small city, and which on one occasion was identified as the smallest municipality in the
                        United States receiving Federal Aid. He was responsible for getting the first telephone exchange
                        in Martin, and was instrumental in the installation of the modern water purification system. He
                        directed the building of two major housing projects, one is named Grigsby�s Heights, just at the
                        edge of town. His family represented the state of Kentucky in the All American Family Search in
                        Miami Beach, in 1957. They were awarded the Eddie Rickenbacher Trophy as the most popular
                        family, elected by the remaining 50 families represented. In recent years he built and owned the
                        Catalina Motel in Lexington, Kentucky. He had numerous business interests in Martin, Kentucky.
                        He is survived by eight children: Pete Grigsby Jr., of McDowell, Kentucky (Phyllis); Charles G.
                        Grigsby, M.D., of Lexington, Kentucky (Sparkle); David Lee Grigsby of Georgetown, Kentucky;
                        Jerry R. Grigsby, DJP, of Nicholasville, Kentucky; Richard Van Grigsby of Lexington, Kentucky
                        (Phyllis); Stephen J. Grigsby of Lexington, Kentucky; Marena G. Evans of Visalia, California
                        (Gary); and Margaret G. Hamilton of Lexington, Kentuc-ky (Frank). In addition, he is survived by
                        38 grandchildren (two deceased); and 39 great-grandchildren. His life was a testimonial to the
                        virtue of honesty and hard, steady work. He was a wonderful, generous and loving father and
                        grandfather. Love and respect for his life and work will long endure, and his presence will be
                        painfully missed by those who cared and loved him. Funeral services for Elhanan �Pete� Grigsby
                        will be conducted Friday, March 15, 2002, at 11 a.m., at the Hall Funeral Home Chapel, Martin,
                        Ky. Entombment will follow in the Lexington Cemetery, under the professional care of the Hall
