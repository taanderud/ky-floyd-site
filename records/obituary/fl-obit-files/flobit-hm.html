                        Hospital, in Edgewood. Born October 26, 1916, near Bainbridge, Ohio, she was the daughter of the
                        late Cleo Clifford and Lena Strader Cast. She lived in Hueysville, until July 2002, where she
                        was a member of the Hueysville Church of Christ.&nbsp; rene grew up in Wilmington, Ohio,
                        graduating as an honor student of Wilmington High School in 1934. She met Rondal while he was
                        attending Wilmington College, and married him in 1937. In 1941, they moved to Hueysville, along
                        with their first daughter, and there, three more daughters were born. She became Postmaster at
                        Hueysville in 1951, and retired in 1981. In 1965, she wrote and published the highly popular
                        cookbook, �What�s Cooking in Kentucky� to re-roof the Hueysville Church of Christ, and buy a
                        church bus. Two years later the church leaders asked her to resume control of the cookbook, but
                        she continued to give much of the profits to the church. When the original two-and-a-half-story
                        church, which was uninsured, burned in 1981, she wrote hundreds of letters, and made many phone
                        calls, soliciting donations to help rebuild the church. Later projects included raising money to
                        buy the carillon chimes and stained glass windows for the church. In 1984 she published her
                        second cookbook, �What�s Cooking for the Holidays.� Irene�s lifelong service to others included
                        supplying food, shelter, clothing, shoes, Christmas toys, medicine, and transportation for
                        medical care. She was always an advocate for better education and the protection of children, at
                        times, personally intervening on their behalf. She spent many hours helping distribute
                        flood-relief items for the Red Cross, and petitioning officials about repairing roadways and
                        bridges, or clearing waterways to prevent flooding. She wrote numerous letters to congressmen,
                        such as Carl Perkins, on behalf of those who needed aid. Her later years were spent encouraging
                        people to come to church. She is survived by four daughters: Carol (Mrs. Lanny) Hiller of Taylor
                        Mill, Kentucky; Sharon (Mrs. James) Claypool of Park Hills, Kentucky; Karen (Mrs. Phil) Handshoe

                    <p><strong><a>HAYES, Rondal Edwin</a></strong><a>&nbsp;</a> Obituary, The Floyd County Times,
                        Prestonsburg, Kentucky, Wednesday, 21 December 2005, page A2. Rondal Edwin Hayes, 90, of
                        Lakeside Park, formerly of Hueysville, the husband of Irene Cast Hayes, died Sunday, December
                        18, 2005, at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Edgewood. He was born in Hueysville, September 7, 1915,
                        the son of the late Frank P. and Lucretia Stewart Hayes. Rondal attended Berea High School his
                        freshman and sophomore years. He graduated from Maytown High School in 1934, where he was an
                        outstanding basketball player. His family moved to a farm in Hillsboro, Ohio, in 1934. There he
                        attended Wilmington College, and met and married his wife, Irene Cast Hayes, in 1937. He, Irene,
                        their first daughter, and his parents, returned to Hueysville in 1941. There, three more
                        daughters were born. He was a postal clerk and worked in the F.P. Hayes General Store, later
                        taking over the store when his father became ill. The store became a nighttime gathering place
                        for locals. Rondal lived in Hueysville, until July of 2002, where he was an elder of the
                        Hueysville Church of Christ. He had also served as youth leader, Sunday school teacher,
                        preacher, secretary and treasurer, church bus driver, adult Bible study teacher, janitor, and
                        repairman. He was best known as the second father to scores of young people, recruiting many of
                        them for service in the church. He never turned away anyone who needed food, a ride to the
                        doctor, money to pay bills, or clothing. Many charges at his store were forgiven, and never
                        collected. He took the youth groups to the swimming pool, Dewey Lake, the skating rink, and
                        pizza restaurants. He organized baseball, softball, and basketball teams, and transported the
                        teams to their games. He donated land that he helped develop into recreational areas for church
                        youth. When the original two-and-a-half story church burned in 1981, he retired from the Post
                        Office and spent the next two years building the new church, that he had designed. As elder, he
                        continued to counsel and encourage member of the church and community. He is survived by his
                        wife, Irene; four daughters: Carol Hiller and her husband, Lanny, of Taylor Mill; Sharon

                        Harris S. Howard, was born November 9, 1955, in Prestonsburg. He departed this life, November
                        16, 2003. John is survived by his mother; a brother, Harris (and his wife, Lee); a sister,
                        Vanessa, and a very special nephew, Jonathan. His paternal grandparents, Jack and Florence
                        Stephens Howard, and his maternal grandparents, Ralph and Myrtie Hill Davis, preceded him in
                        death. John graduated from Transylvania University, Summa Cum Laude, in 1977, and was in his
                        first year of medical school when he had an automobile accident that left him a quadriplegic.
                        After many months of therapy, and with strong determination, he decided that even though he
                        would not be able to use his hands to become a surgeon, he could use his keen mind to become an
                        attorney. Upon completion of law school, John worked as Staff Attorney for the Kentucky Court of
                        Appeals, before going into private practice. He was a member of the First Methodist Church, a
                        member of the Floyd County, Kentucky, and American Bar Associations. He also served eight years
                        on the Board of Directors of Mountain Comprehensive Care Center. John believed that achievement
                        comes when you decide to live your possibilities and that it isn�t life that matters, it�s the
                        courage you bring to it. He overcame monumental obstacles with courage, faith and integrity.
