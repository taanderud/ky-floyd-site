                    <p><strong>HAYES, Irene Cast</strong> Age, 90, of Lakeside Park, Kentucky, formerly of Hueysville,
                        and widow of Rondal E. Hayes, died Saturday, April 7, 2007, at St. Elizabeth Hospital, in
                        Edgewood. Born October 26, 1916, near Bainbridge, Ohio, she was the daughter of the late Cleo
                        Clifford and Lena Strader Cast. She lived in Hueysville, until July 2002, where she was a member
                        of the Hueysville Church of Christ. rene grew up in Wilmington, Ohio, graduating as an honor
                        student of Wilmington High School in 1934. She met Rondal while he was attending Wilmington
                        College, and married him in 1937. In 1941, they moved to Hueysville, along with their first
                        daughter, and there, three more daughters were born. She became Postmaster at Hueysville in
                        1951, and retired in 1981. In 1965, she wrote and published the highly popular cookbook, "What"s
                        Cooking in Kentucky" to re-roof the Hueysville Church of Christ, and buy a church bus. Two years
                        later the church leaders asked her to resume control of the cookbook, but she continued to give
                        much of the profits to the church. When the original two-and-a-half-story church, which was
                        uninsured, burned in 1981, she wrote hundreds of letters, and made many phone calls, soliciting
                        donations to help rebuild the church. Later projects included raising money to buy the carillon
                        chimes and stained glass windows for the church. In 1984 she published her second cookbook,
                        "What"s Cooking for the Holidays." Irene"s lifelong service to others included supplying food,
                        shelter, clothing, shoes, Christmas toys, medicine, and transportation for medical care. She was
                        always an advocate for better education and the protection of children, at times, personally
                        intervening on their behalf. She spent many hours helping distribute flood-relief items for the
                        Red Cross, and petitioning officials about repairing roadways and bridges, or clearing waterways
                        to prevent flooding. She wrote numerous letters to congressmen, such as Carl Perkins, on behalf
                        of those who needed aid. Her later years were spent encouraging people to come to church. She is
                        survived by four daughters: Carol (Mrs. Lanny) Hiller of Taylor Mill, Kentucky; Sharon (Mrs.
                        James) Claypool of Park Hills, Kentucky; Karen (Mrs. Phil) Handshoe of Winchester, Kentucky; and
                        Ronda Stachia (Mrs. Marvin) Knorr of Lakeside Park, Kentucky; a sister, Rosa Lee Miller of
                        Englewood, Ohio; eight grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. Funeral services will be
                        conducted Wednesday, April 11, at 2:00 p.m., at the Hueysville Church of Christ, with Bro.
                        Chester A. Varney officiating. Burial will follow in the Davidson Memorial Gardens at Ivel,

                        Prestonsburg, Kentucky, Wednesday, 21 December 2005, page A2. Rondal Edwin Hayes, 90, of
                        Lakeside Park, formerly of Hueysville, the husband of Irene Cast Hayes, died Sunday, December
                        18, 2005, at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Edgewood. He was born in Hueysville, September 7, 1915,
                        the son of the late Frank P. and Lucretia Stewart Hayes. Rondal attended Berea High School his
                        freshman and sophomore years. He graduated from Maytown High School in 1934, where he was an
                        outstanding basketball player. His family moved to a farm in Hillsboro, Ohio, in 1934. There he
                        attended Wilmington College, and met and married his wife, Irene Cast Hayes, in 1937. He, Irene,
                        their first daughter, and his parents, returned to Hueysville in 1941. There, three more
                        daughters were born. He was a postal clerk and worked in the F.P. Hayes General Store, later
                        taking over the store when his father became ill. The store became a nighttime gathering place
                        for locals. Rondal lived in Hueysville, until July of 2002, where he was an elder of the
                        Hueysville Church of Christ. He had also served as youth leader, Sunday school teacher,
                        preacher, secretary and treasurer, church bus driver, adult Bible study teacher, janitor, and
                        repairman. He was best known as the second father to scores of young people, recruiting many of
                        them for service in the church. He never turned away anyone who needed food, a ride to the
                        doctor, money to pay bills, or clothing. Many charges at his store were forgiven, and never
                        collected. He took the youth groups to the swimming pool, Dewey Lake, the skating rink, and
                        pizza restaurants. He organized baseball, softball, and basketball teams, and transported the
                        teams to their games. He donated land that he helped develop into recreational areas for church
                        youth. When the original two-and-a-half story church burned in 1981, he retired from the Post
                        Office and spent the next two years building the new church, that he had designed. As elder, he
                        continued to counsel and encourage member of the church and community. He is survived by his
                        wife, Irene; four daughters: Carol Hiller and her husband, Lanny, of Taylor Mill; Sharon

                    <p><strong>HOWARD, John Woodford II</strong> Son of Jane Davis Howard and the late Judge Harris S.
                        Howard, was born November 9, 1955, in Prestonsburg. He departed this life, November 16, 2003.
                        John is survived by his mother; a brother, Harris (and his wife, Lee); a sister, Vanessa, and a
                        very special nephew, Jonathan. His paternal grandparents, Jack and Florence Stephens Howard, and
                        his maternal grandparents, Ralph and Myrtie Hill Davis, preceded him in death. John graduated
                        from Transylvania University, Summa Cum Laude, in 1977, and was in his first year of medical
                        school when he had an automobile accident that left him a quadriplegic. After many months of
                        therapy, and with strong determination, he decided that even though he would not be able to use
                        his hands to become a surgeon, he could use his keen mind to become an attorney. Upon completion
                        of law school, John worked as Staff Attorney for the Kentucky Court of Appeals, before going
                        into private practice. He was a member of the First Methodist Church, a member of the Floyd
                        County, Kentucky, and American Bar Associations. He also served eight years on the Board of
                        Directors of Mountain Comprehensive Care Center. John believed that achievement comes when you
                        decide to live your possibilities and that it isn"t life that matters, it"s the courage you
                        bring to it. He overcame monumental obstacles with courage, faith and integrity. Funeral
                        services will be 1 p.m., Thursday, at the First United Methodist Church. Memorial contributions
