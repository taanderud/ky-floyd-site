                        answered the roll call of death December 11, 1907, aged 71 years, 8 months and 8 days. About the
                        year 1853 father first married Anna Blankenship, and unto them was born 7 children. Father
                        enlisted in the Civil War in the year 1862, and was mustered out April 15, 1865. After his first
                        wife died, he married Martha Balden, about the year 1872, and as a result of this happy union,
                        to them was born 11 children, of whom two are dead, one of whom belonged to the Old Regular
                        Baptist Church when she died. Father was sick from August to Dec. 11, 1907. He professed a hope
                        in Christ and shouted and praised God, and charged his children to have no doubts about his
                        eternal salvation for when I leave here I am going home to Glory, and said: "Children, I heard
                        the prettiest singing the other night. I saw Christ coming with His angels from every direction
                        in the brightest cloud I ever saw. Children, I could tell your mother's voice from all the rest,
                        she was in the lead. They were singing the song of Moses and the Lamb by and by. Me and my

                    <p><strong>JONES, Martha</strong> To the memory of a dear mother, it is so sad with me that I can
                        hardly bear to write a sketch of the life of my dear mother who has gone home to Glory to reign
                        with Christ. Mother was born about March, 1850, and was married to Ambrose Jones at the age of
                        22 years. She was the mother of 11 children of the 18 of father's family; She was a true and
                        gentle mother until her death. Two of her children has professed a hope in Christ. Mother has a
                        severe stroke of paralysis May 16, 1905. She lay 4 months and 7 days before she professed a hope
                        in Christ and called on the elders John M. Akers and C. C. Mitchell to come and hold meeting at
                        her house, who at the close of the service published an open door for the reception of members
                        by experience and baptism, when mother gave her hand and told them what good things the Lord had
                        done for the soul. I was present at the time she professed a hope, she told them she wanted to
                        go down into the water and be burried with Christ in baptism. They carried mother on a chair to
                        the water side, she went into the water praising God and came up out of the water and shouted
                        praise to the Lord at the top of her voice. It was a great comfort to her insomuch that when any
                        of the brethren and sisters would come in to see her and try to comfort her in her afflictions
                        she would shout and rejoice, and her children, when they would start for home, Mother would give
                        them her hand and bid them farewell. Mother left three little orphans behind to mourn her loss
                        with the rest of us, one afflicted with white swelling. Mother lived 13 months and 20 days in
                        the fellowship of the church, before God called her home. Composed by Mahala Jones August 1,
