                        Pikeville Freewill Baptist Church. She was preceded in death by her husband, Frank Clark; a son,
                        Morton Downey; and sisters: Stella Hicks, Dora Patton, and Flora Woods. Her faith in God and her
                        family were the most important aspects of Della's life. She is survived by four children: Rod
                        Clark and his wife, Georgia, of Miamisburg, Ohio, Sybil Barefoot and her husband, Granville of
                        San Jose, California, John Clark and his wife, Beth, of Louisville; and a daughter, Sandy Clark

                        large circle in the U.S. and abroad. Over the years Della lived with her husband, Frank and

                        retirement years, she often spent time with her daughters in California, where she passed away.
                        She was a cosmetologist/instructor, holding licenses in Ohio, California, Virginia, and
                        Kentucky.&nbsp; A highlight of her life was her many years as owner of the Pikeville Beauty

                        truly a woman of grace and love. It was there she instructed her beloved students and served the
                        patrons with her faith in God, her gentle spirit, and huge heart. Many lives were touched by her
                        presence. She will be missed beyond measure. Funeral services will be held at the Pikeville

                    <p><strong>CONN, Hiram , Sr.,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Was born July 14, 1850 and departed this life
                        September 27th, 1939, at the age of 89 years, 7 months, 13 days. He was born in Floyd County and
                        resided within a few miles of the same place all of his life. At about the age of 19 years he
                        was married to Ellen Crum, and to that union were born 12 children, 8 boys and 4 girls. Five
                        boys, Frank, Jim, Ike, Dave, and Lee and one daughter, Nella Spears, are still living. On the
                        23rd day of August, 1893, the 'home circle' was broken by the death of Uncle Hi's first wife. On
                        the 23rd of November, 1893, he was united in marriage with Catherine Howell and to that union
                        were born two boys and three girls, all of whom still survive except one daughter, Helen, who
                        was killed by a train May 25, 1929 while trying to rescue her child. Charley, Henry, Nicy, and
                        Myrtle are left to mourn the loss of a departed father. On the 20th day of January, 1918, the
                        death angel again visited that happy home and took from his embrace his second companion. On the
                        7th day of June, 1919, he was united in marriage to Jennie B. Adkins, who for more than 19 years
                        cared for and administered to his every want and on September 7, 1938, she too was called away.
                        Uncle Hi leaves 11 children, 122 grandchildren, 281 great-grandchildren and 61
                        great-great-grandchildren. A total of 475. Uncle Hi always lived a quite and peaceable life and
                        was more than forty years ago he joined the Old Regular Baptist Church and has lived a devoted
                        Christian life since. During his stay on earth he enjoyed excellent health and until he was more
                        than 80 years of age was able to ride long distances to his church. On the 12th day of July,
                        1939, he had a stroke of paralysis, which rendered him speechless and almost helpless. He would
                        often make an effort to talk to his children who assembled around his bedside and these is no
                        doubt in the writer's mind but what he was trying to counsel them, or tell them that his path
                        was clear and he would soon join those loved ones gone on before. Every care was administered by
                        his children who were ever by his bedside. It is our humble opinion that the Lord will bless and
                        reward children who take such kind and tender care of father as those have, especially Myrtle
                        and John S., who were never too tired or sleepy to administer to his every want, not only them
                        but others also. Children, father is gone, cannot be here with you again, but you know the life
                        he would have you live, that you may meet him over there, and together ever be with the Lord.
