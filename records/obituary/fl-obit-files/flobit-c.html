                        Melvina Hall. She was a member of the Pikeville Freewill Baptist Church. She was preceded in

                        and Flora Woods. Her faith in God and her family were the most important aspects of Della's
                        life. She is survived by four children: Rod Clark and his wife, Georgia, of Miamisburg, Ohio,
                        Sybil Barefoot and her husband, Granville of San Jose, California, John Clark and his wife,

                        Virginia, and Kentucky. A highlight of her life was her many years as owner of the Pikeville
                        Beauty College on Grace Avenue in Pikeville. It is fitting she would work on Grace Avenue, for
                        she was truly a woman of grace and love. It was there she instructed her beloved students and
                        served the patrons with her faith in God, her gentle spirit, and huge heart. Many lives were
                        touched by her presence. She will be missed beyond measure. Funeral services will be held at the

                    <h3>CONN, Hiram , Sr.,</h3>
                    <p> Was born July 14, 1850 and departed this life September 27th, 1939, at the age of 89 years, 7
                        months, 13 days. He was born in Floyd County and resided within a few miles of the same place
                        all of his life. At about the age of 19 years he was married to Ellen Crum, and to that union
                        were born 12 children, 8 boys and 4 girls. Five boys, Frank, Jim, Ike, Dave, and Lee and one
                        daughter, Nella Spears, are still living. On the 23rd day of August, 1893, the 'home circle' was
                        broken by the death of Uncle Hi's first wife. On the 23rd of November, 1893, he was united in
                        marriage with Catherine Howell and to that union were born two boys and three girls, all of whom
                        still survive except one daughter, Helen, who was killed by a train May 25, 1929 while trying to
                        rescue her child. Charley, Henry, Nicy, and Myrtle are left to mourn the loss of a departed
                        father. On the 20th day of January, 1918, the death angel again visited that happy home and took
                        from his embrace his second companion. On the 7th day of June, 1919, he was united in marriage
                        to Jennie B. Adkins, who for more than 19 years cared for and administered to his every want and
                        on September 7, 1938, she too was called away. Uncle Hi leaves 11 children, 122 grandchildren,
                        281 great-grandchildren and 61 great-great-grandchildren. A total of 475. Uncle Hi always lived
                        a quite and peaceable life and was more than forty years ago he joined the Old Regular Baptist
                        Church and has lived a devoted Christian life since. During his stay on earth he enjoyed
                        excellent health and until he was more than 80 years of age was able to ride long distances to
                        his church. On the 12th day of July, 1939, he had a stroke of paralysis, which rendered him
                        speechless and almost helpless. He would often make an effort to talk to his children who
                        assembled around his bedside and these is no doubt in the writer's mind but what he was trying
                        to counsel them, or tell them that his path was clear and he would soon join those loved ones
                        gone on before. Every care was administered by his children who were ever by his bedside. It is
                        our humble opinion that the Lord will bless and reward children who take such kind and tender
                        care of father as those have, especially Myrtle and John S., who were never too tired or sleepy
                        to administer to his every want, not only them but others also. Children, father is gone, cannot
                        be here with you again, but you know the life he would have you live, that you may meet him over
                        there, and together ever be with the Lord. Written by a friend and neighbor. (Submitted by
