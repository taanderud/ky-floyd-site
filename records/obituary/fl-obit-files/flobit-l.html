                    <p><strong>LIKENS, Nicholas "Nick" Kyle</strong> Age, 13, of Georgetown, brave warrior, lover of
                        life, and skateboard enthusiast, died at his home after a two year battle with Neuroblastoma
                        cancer. He touched many lives and always had a smile on his face. He absolutely loved to
                        skateboard, and any time he wasn't in the hospital or clinic, he was skateboarding, on a quest
                        to improve his skills. He told us that skateboarding was his therapy for dealing with his
                        cancer, and that it actually took his mind off of his pain. The one thing more important than
                        skateboarding, to Nick, was his family and friends. He loved to have a good time, but he would
                        also do anything for his loved ones if they were upset or hurt. Nick was very caring and always
                        thought of others before himself. Survivors include his parents, Shannon Leigh Schuller Likens
                        and Dwayne Likens; a sister, Morganne "Alex" Likens; his grandparents, Connie Jones, Golda Mae

                        DeRossett; his cousins, Lauren, Katherine, Gabriel and Zara Van Hoose, Charlie and Andrew
                        DeRossett, Olivia and Chloe Toole; and his beloved pets, Checkers and Scooby. Funeral services

                        indebted to Dr. Wagner, Lars and Cincinnati Children's Hospital, for the love and devotion in
                        providing Nick the very best care possible. Donations should be made to the "Nick Likens,
                        Skateboarding Fund," at Central Bank, 100 W. Main Street, Georgetown, Ky. 40324. This fund will

                    <p><strong>LITTLE, Carlos</strong> Born October, 1916, at Wheelwright, was the beloved husband of
                        Georgia Young Little, and the loving brother of Junior (Delores) Little, Myrtle (Donald) Dorton,
                        Ailene (John) Luxmore, Helen (Billy J.) Turner, Rosemary (Sherrill) Reid, and Jack (Peggy)
                        Little. Carlos was the oldest of 12 children born to Oliver and Dorothy Dean Warren Little.
                        Deceased are Mike (Billie) Little, Willie (Reba) Little, Elsie (James) King, Paul (Lorraine)
                        Little, and Gracie Little. Carlos became a lineman for Consolidated Coal Company at Jenkins. He
                        learned this skill from, and worked with his father, for many years. He was in the first draft
                        set in motion for world war II. His occupation as a lineman became a skill that served his
                        country. He became a tech sergeant with the responsibility of keeping communication lines open
                        during battle. Although memories fade, he remembered the names of every man under his command,
                        and kept them in his memories. He served in six battlefields-West Africa, Germany, France,
                        Sicily, Italy, and Austria. He received seven bronze stars, Theater ribbon, one bronze
                        arrowhead, American Defense medal, and good conduct medal. We honor our brother as a veteran and
                        hero of World War II. Carlos became the owner of gas stations in Huntington, W.Va., Hi Hat, and
                        owner of a restaurant/gas station at Lowmansville. He retired from C&amp;O at Raceland. It was
                        at this time that he turned his love for cars into a hobby, and found his greatest enjoyment in
                        belonging and traveling with the Mustang Car Club of Ashland. He cherished close friendships
                        with the Mustang Club members, and with members who helped him with his dream of restoring cars,
                        especially Don Bowman, and Lowell and Keith Carrico. He also, treasured this special time with
                        his brother, Paul, and his close friend, Ott Ratliff. Carlos was a member of the Kenova Baptist
                        Church, in Huntington, W.Va. When he moved to Kentucky, he donated ownership of his home in
                        Huntington, to the Kenova Church. His devotion as a member of the church was an important part
                        of his life. He served as moderator at the Bethany Baptist Church. Unable to take care of
                        himself, he had the loving care of Rosemary (caregiver), and his sisters, Myrtle and Aliene.
                        Also, Robert, Pam, and Stevie Reid. Jack was also there for him, when he was in Huntington
                        Hospital. To all who touched his life, treasure that time, and keep the memories. I would like
                        to read from Psalms 103: As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the
                        field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place known it no more. But the
                        steadfast love of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting. Funeral services for Carlos
                        Little will be conducted Wednesday, October 11, at 1 p.m., at the Hall Funeral Home Chapel, in
                        Martin, with Regular Baptist ministers officiating. Burial will follow in the Boyd Cemetery, in

                    <p><strong>LOGAN, Clarence Larry</strong> Age, 65, completed his journey on this planet, and left
                        for his heavenly reward, this 29th day of May, in the year of our Lord 2007. He was a member of
                        the Tates Creek Christian Church in Lexington. Born in his beloved Maytown, December 14, 1941,
                        Larry was the most gregarious, loyal, generous, and entertaining of men. He was a "man for all
                        seasons," one to be counted upon by family and friends, one with integrity and faith. He created
                        laughter where there was none, and took ordinary travels and events, and spun them into the most
                        delightful of stories. He was bigger than life, a strapping and vibrant man who loved and
                        laughed and cried with the deepest of feelings, and with no shame. First and foremost, he loved
                        his precious wife, Nancy, and would tell a stranger how beautiful and wonderful she was.
                        Further, he deeply loved his two sons: Steve and John; and his mother, Stella; as well as his
                        sister, Glenda, whom he called "Sis"; and his grandchildren. He also loved the rest of us, his
                        extended family and friends; the University of Kentucky basketball; May-town High School in
                        Floyd County; his home in Florida, as well as his home in Lexington; Mardi Gras in New Orleans;
                        and his travels with Nancy, especially the many trips throughout the western part of our nation;
                        and the good times with his friends at the racetrack. Larry graduated from the University of
                        Kentucky in 1966, with a Bachelor of Arts in Education. He was the assistant director of
                        Probation and Parole (field service manager) for the Commonwealth; director of Donor Services
                        and Director of Public Relations for the Central Kentucky Blood Center; served as probation and
                        parole officer for the state of Kentucky; worked as a consultant for the Kentucky Peer Review
                        Organization Inc.; was the executive director of Big Brothers in Lexington; director of Outlook
                        House; assistant unit director for Kentucky Children"s Home in Louisville; supervisor and
                        coordinator for Kentucky Village in Lexington; and was a juvenile counselor in Franklin and
                        Jessamine counties. In 1982, Larry founded Logan Security Inc., in Lexington, and served as
                        president and chief operating officer. He retired in 2000. Larry was preceded in death by his
                        father, Clarence Logan; and by his brother, Bill Logan. We are bereaved, but we are comforted
                        knowing that Larry is with Our Lord Jesus Christ in Heaven. He is survived by his beloved wife,
                        Nancy; two sons: Steve and John; his mother, Stella Logan; his sister, Glenda Kuck; his
                        grandchildren, Joshua, Matthew, and Gracie; and his daughter-in-law, Carolyn Logan. A
                        celebration of his life will take place at 10:00 am on Saturday, June 2, 2007, at Kerr Brothers
                        Funeral Home on Harrodsburg Road, with burial to follow in Lexington Cemetery. Visitation will
