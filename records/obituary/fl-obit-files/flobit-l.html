                        lover of life, and skateboard enthusiast, died at his home after a two year battle with
                        Neuroblastoma cancer. He touched many lives and always had a smile on his face. He absolutely
                        loved to skateboard, and any time he wasn't in the hospital or clinic, he was skateboarding, on
                        a quest to improve his skills. He told us that skateboarding was his therapy for dealing with
                        his cancer, and that it actually took his mind off of his pain. The one thing more important
                        than skateboarding, to Nick, was his family and friends. He loved to have a good time, but he
                        would also do anything for his loved ones if they were upset or hurt. Nick was very caring and
                        always thought of others before himself. Survivors include his parents, Shannon Leigh Schuller
                        Likens and Dwayne Likens; a sister, Morganne "Alex" Likens; his grandparents, Connie Jones,

                        (Donald) Dorton, Ailene (John) Luxmore, Helen (Billy J.) Turner, Rosemary (Sherrill) Reid, and
                        Jack (Peggy) Little. Carlos was the oldest of 12 children born to Oliver and Dorothy Dean Warren
                        Little. Deceased are Mike (Billie) Little, Willie (Reba) Little, Elsie (James) King, Paul
                        (Lorraine) Little, and Gracie Little. Carlos became a lineman for Consolidated Coal Company at
                        Jenkins. He learned this skill from, and worked with his father, for many years. He was in the
                        first draft set in motion for world war II. His occupation as a lineman became a skill that
                        served his country. He became a tech sergeant with the responsibility of keeping communication
                        lines open during battle. Although memories fade, he remembered the names of every man under his
                        command, and kept them in his memories. He served in six battlefields-West Africa, Germany,
                        France, Sicily, Italy, and Austria. He received seven bronze stars, Theater ribbon, one bronze
                        arrowhead, American Defense medal, and good conduct medal. We honor our brother as a veteran and
                        hero of World War II. Carlos became the owner of gas stations in Huntington, W.Va., Hi Hat, and
                        owner of a restaurant/gas station at Lowmansville. He retired from C&amp;O at Raceland. It was
                        at this time that he turned his love for cars into a hobby, and found his greatest enjoyment in
                        belonging and traveling with the Mustang Car Club of Ashland. He cherished close friendships
                        with the Mustang Club members, and with members who helped him with his dream of restoring cars,
                        especially Don Bowman, and Lowell and Keith Carrico. He also, treasured this special time with
                        his brother, Paul, and his close friend, Ott Ratliff.&nbsp; Carlos was a member of the Kenova
                        Baptist Church, in Huntington, W.Va. When he moved to Kentucky, he donated ownership of his home
                        in Huntington, to the Kenova Church. His devotion as a member of the church was an important
                        part of his life. He served as moderator at the Bethany Baptist Church.&nbsp; Unable to take
                        care of himself, he had the loving care of Rosemary (caregiver), and his sisters, Myrtle and
                        Aliene. Also, Robert, Pam, and Stevie Reid. Jack was also there for him, when he was in
                        Huntington Hospital. To all who touched his life, treasure that time, and keep the memories. I
                        would like to read from Psalms 103: As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a
                        flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place known it no
                        more. But the steadfast love of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting. Funeral services
                        for Carlos Little will be conducted Wednesday, October 11, at 1 p.m., at the Hall Funeral Home

                        and left for his heavenly reward, this 29th day of May, in the year of our Lord 2007. He was a
                        member of the Tates Creek Christian Church in Lexington.&nbsp; Born in his beloved Maytown,
                        December 14, 1941, Larry was the most gregarious, loyal, generous, and entertaining of men. He
                        was a �man for all seasons,� one to be counted upon by family and friends, one with integrity
                        and faith. He created laughter where there was none, and took ordinary travels and events, and
                        spun them into the most delightful of stories. He was bigger than life, a strapping and vibrant
                        man who loved and laughed and cried with the deepest of feelings, and with no shame.&nbsp; First
                        and foremost, he loved his precious wife, Nancy, and would tell a stranger how beautiful and
                        wonderful she was. Further, he deeply loved his two sons: Steve and John; and his mother,
                        Stella; as well as his sister, Glenda, whom he called �Sis�; and his grandchildren. He also
                        loved the rest of us, his extended family and friends; the University of Kentucky basketball;
                        May-town High School in Floyd County; his home in Florida, as well as his home in Lexington;
                        Mardi Gras in New Orleans; and his travels with Nancy, especially the many trips throughout the
                        western part of our nation; and the good times with his friends at the racetrack.&nbsp; Larry
                        graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1966, with a Bachelor of Arts in Education. He was
                        the assistant director of Probation and Parole (field service manager) for the Commonwealth;
                        director of Donor Services and Director of Public Relations for the Central Kentucky Blood
                        Center; served as probation and parole officer for the state of Kentucky; worked as a consultant
                        for the Kentucky Peer Review Organization Inc.; was the executive director of Big Brothers in
                        Lexington; director of Outlook House; assistant unit director for Kentucky Children�s Home in
                        Louisville; supervisor and coordinator for Kentucky Village in Lexington; and was a juvenile
                        counselor in Franklin and Jessamine counties. In 1982, Larry founded Logan Security Inc., in
                        Lexington, and served as president and chief operating officer. He retired in 2000.&nbsp; Larry
                        was preceded in death by his father, Clarence Logan; and by his brother, Bill Logan.&nbsp; We
                        are bereaved, but we are comforted knowing that Larry is with Our Lord Jesus Christ in
                        Heaven.&nbsp; He is survived by his beloved wife, Nancy; two sons: Steve and John; his mother,
                        Stella Logan; his sister, Glenda Kuck; his grandchildren, Joshua, Matthew, and Gracie; and his
