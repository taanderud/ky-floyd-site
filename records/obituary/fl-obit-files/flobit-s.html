                    <p><strong>SKAGGS, James Douglas</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the clear sunny morning of April 19, 2007,
                        James Douglas Skaggs gently left the loving arms of his family to spend eternity in the light of
                        our loving God. He was born on June 27, 1934, the second child of Van Skaggs and Eurcle Davis
                        Skaggs. His joy was his family, and he is survived by his wife and companion of 51 years,
                        Phyllis Tackett Skaggs of Cocoa, Florida, and Lowmansville. Other survivors include his sons
                        James Phillip Skaggs of Lowmansville, and Timothy Ray Skaggs of Houston, Texas; grandsons: James
                        Phillip Skaggs II, of Cocoa, Florida, and Jeffrey Douglas Skaggs of Houston, Texas; a sister,
                        Betty Skaggs Daniel of Titusville, Florida; and a brother, David Ray Skaggs of Lowmansville;
                        along with numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins. He was preceded in eternity by his mother and
                        father, and brother, Paul Edward Skaggs. He will be remembered most as a loving husband, father
                        and brother. In addition, he was a successful businessman, building three businesses, including
                        Big Sandy Heating and Cooling of Paintsville. He reveled in the awe of nature, and spent his
                        best days with family on the farm. Most importantly, he lived his life as a testimony to his
                        saviour Jesus Christ, and our pain is eased by the knowledge of His peace. The family requests
                        that memorial donations be made to First Baptist Church of Paintsville. A memorial for family
                        and friends will be held at a time and location, to be announced later. (FCT'S&nbsp; 04-27-2007)

                    <p><strong><a>SLONE, Rev. Vernon</a></strong><a>&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; Age, 77, of Prestonsburg, died
                        Sunday, April 11, 2004, at his residence. Born December 6, 1926, at Blue River, he was the son
                        of the late Charlie and Osie Slone. He was founder and pastor emeritus of the Middle Creek
                        Baptist Church, at Blue River; prior to his ministry, he worked at Chrysler Corp., in
                        Minneapolis, was a U.S. Navy veteran, and was also a tax preparer. He was saved in 1958 in
                        Indianapolis, on Easter morning. In 1971, the Lord spoke to his heart that he should go to the
                        hills of Kentucky to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. He surrendered to that call.
                        The Middle Creek Baptist Church was established in June 1971. He resigned as pastor in September
                        2003, because of illness. His greatest joy was telling people to believe in the Lord Jesus
                        Christ and be saved. The Lord called Vernon to be with Him in Heaven on Easter morning,
                        thirty-three years later. He served his country in the U.S. Navy, at the end of World War II. He

                    <p><strong>STOVER, Dorothy Conley</strong>&nbsp; Age 72, completed her journey on this planet and
                        left for her heavenly reward this 16th day of June, in the year of our Lord 2008. She was a
                        devoted member of the First United Methodist Church in Prestonsburg. Dorothy Ann was born on
                        December 6th, 1935, in Williamson, West Virginia. She was known to all as a kind and gentle soul
                        with just a dash of mischievous humor. She could always be counted for a kind word or helping
                        hand to anyone, whether it be friend, family member, or even a stranger. Her greatest love in
                        life was her husband, Jess; together they have set a loving example of what a life lived in
                        love, and with a love of Christ should be. She graduated from West Virginia Tech in 1958, with a
                        Bachelor of Arts in Journalism. In her time on this earth she was an educator, entrepreneur, and
                        homemaker. Dorothy was a former president of the Highlands Regional Medical Center Auxiliary,
                        and served willingly in other church, civic and social organizations. Dorothy was preceded in
                        death by her parents: George Thomas and Lola Davis Conley. We are bereaved, but we are comforted
                        in knowing that Dorothy is with Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in Heaven. We cannot help but
                        praise him for the precious gift that was her life. She is survived by her beloved husband,
                        Jess; a daughter, Leann (Robert) Rodgers; a son, Tommy; and three grandchildren: Sarah, Katie,
                        and Thomas Rodgers of Frankfort, Kentucky. She is also survived by her sister, Betty Conley
                        Campbell of Yadkinville, North Carolina; and many beloved nieces and nephews. Pallbearers are:
                        Clark Allison, Tom Blackburn, James Butcher, Dave Calhoun, Eddie Clark, Romeo Delrosario, Kent

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the scrapbook of Cora Coburn Meadows (FCT'S) </p>
                    <p><strong>SAMMONS, Ada</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with thoughts of my Saviour on my mind that I
                        will attempt to write part of my obituary. I, Ada Jean Branham Samons, was born June 21, 1952,
                        the daughter of the late Elisha and Goldie McCoy Branham. I have left this earthly home for a
                        beautiful Kingdom, on Friday, October 7, 2005. She is preceded in death by her mother and
                        father; one brother, Russell Branham; three sisters: Alma Branham, Eusla Branham, and Anzie
                        Branham. Her surviving brothers are Kenton Branham, Troy Branham, and Elisha Branham Jr. Her
                        surviving sisters are Marie Tackett and Ann Sigler. Also many nieces and nephews, and one
                        beloved dear friend, Lillian Akers. On August 7, 1971, I was united in marriage to Daniel Lee
                        Samons, my companion of 34 years; not only my husband, but my brother in Christ. Some of my
                        greatest blessings have been hearing him blessed by our Great God to preach his Gospel. To our
                        union was born two daughters: Anzie Samons Thacker and Amy Lee Samons; one son-in-law, who is
                        like my son, Scott Thacker; three precious grandchildren: Kayla Renee Thacker, Byron Scott
                        Thacker, and Jason Daniel Lee Samons. On June 26, 1971, I was born again, a second time, this
                        time as a child of God. This was the greatest day of my life. I have had many blessings, but
                        this was the greatest one of all, and one I can always feel a great place like no other time,
                        when I think back to that day. I was baptized by Elder Johnnie Hall and Elder Junia Damron, and
                        blessed to wash my mother's feet that same day. In 1984, I washed her feet at home, this being
                        her last communion before her death in 1985. I have had many illnesses in this life, but I want
                        all my sickness and sorrow here. I know when I awake in that Great morning, I won't be sick
                        anymore, and will be able to live forever with my Saviour. To my children, grandchildren, and my
                        dear companion, I hate to leave you, but don't cry for me. I will be happy and not hurting
                        anymore. Please keep God's faith, and some day we can meet again, never to be parted no more.

                        his home, following a period of declining health. Born October 20, 1914, in Johnson County, he
                        was the son of Lewis Sammons. He is survived by his loving wife of 64 years, Marjorie Christine
                        Vance Sammons; a daughter and son-in-law, Mary Beth and Jay Henthorne of Wooster, Ohio; a son,
                        John Phillip Sammons of Prestonsburg; and two sisters: Ada Mullett and Ruby Hughes. He also
                        leaves three grandsons, whom he adored, Jason Fitzgerald Henthorne, Jonathan Vance Henthorne and
                        Jesse Vance Sammons; and a granddaughter-in-law, Heather Kuntz Henthorne. John P. was preceded
                        in death by one sister, Lillian Fultz; and four brothers: Jim, Warnie, Richard, and Archie
                        Sammons. Ever the great storyteller, John P. used to delight his family with stories about his
                        adventures and his love of motorcycles, including his two trips to Key West, Florida, and on to
                        Cuba by boat in the 1930's, with Herman Porter and other friends. Very patriotic, John P., was
                        an U.S. Army veteran and a 50-year Mason, belonging to John W. Hall Lodge No. 950, Martin. He
                        was a faithful University of Kentucky basketball fan, and sports was his passion, especially
                        baseball and fishing. John P. worked for the Turner Elkhorn Mining Company most of his life, and
                        coal mining was more than just an occupation to him. He rode around in his truck with a sign
                        saying "I'm a coal miner, and proud of it." His family used to tease him about mining coal in
                        his sleep. He was a part of many, many winning teams for Turner Elkhorn in the First Aid Mining
                        competitions. He was so very happy to have been born in the USA, and raised in eastern Kentucky,
                        surrounded by the mountains that were so dear to him, and that he knew so well. Funeral services
                        were conducted Tuesday, June 7, at 11 a.m., at Hall Funeral Home, Martin. In lieu of flowers,

                        One Hundred and Sixty-Eighth Annual Session of The New Salem Association of Old Regular Baptist

                        son-in-law Terry Triplett It is with a heavy heart that I write the obituary of my Father-in-law
                        Andy Scott. Andy was born on Stone Coal Creek, in Garrett, Kentucky (Floyd County) on May 18,
                        1912 to Jefferson Scott and Mary Ward Scott, and passed this life on August 1, 1993 making his
                        stay on earth 81 years, 2 months and 14 days. Early in life he met and married Callie Hale, who
                        proceeded him in death, and to this union was born 13 children. Two children, Elizabeth Scott
                        and Dan Scott also preceded him in death. Left to mourn his passing are 4 sons, Earnest Scott,
                        Randolph Scott, Frank Scott and Rodney Scott. Seven daughters, Wanda Lee Rister, Imolene Hicks,
                        Irene Butcher Talaska, Linda Faye Christain, Sallie May Pratt, Mattie Ruth Triplett and Mary Sue
                        Wicker. 46 Grand Children, 37 Great Grand Children, 2 Great Great Grand Children and many many
                        friends. Andy was a hard worker all his life. He Retired from two unions, the UMWA (united mine
                        workers of America) and the Laborers International Union. He was proud to be a union worker for
                        over 50 years. In his retirement he loved hunting and fishing and enjoyed life to it's fullest.
                        Andy never joined a church, but attended Stone Coal Old Regular Baptist Church regularly and
                        felt that it was his home. Four days before Andy died Elder Ed Moore said he had a dream about
                        Andy. He said in his dream he and Andy were cutting down a tree. Ed said that the tree was made
                        of glass and it was sparkling like crystal. Ed said in his dream that they cut the tree down and
                        he turned to see Andy and he was climbing up a limb like a squirrel and disappeared in a cloud.
                        Ed said Andy never looked back. On the morning of the day Andy passed away, I think he knew he
                        was dying, but I never saw any fear in his eyes. As the day grew longer and he grew weaker, his
                        love for his family and friends grew stronger. When the time came, he just went to sleep. In my
                        heart I feel that a band of Angels was around his bed to take him home. The Bible says that a
                        tree is known by the fruit it bears. I've been a member of Andy's family for 23 years, Andy's
                        fruit was good.&nbsp; Submitted by trip608@msn.com</p>

                        the help of the good Lord and all the fond memories I hold so precious to me, I'll try to write
                        an obituary of my beloved mother, Callie Hale Scott. Mom was born January 16, 1917 at Manton,
                        Kentucky. She entered into eternal rest on Easter Sunday, March 30, 1986, making her stay on
                        earth a little over 69 years. In early life mom met, loved and married Andy Scott, and to this
                        union thirteen children were born (two of whom preceded Mom in death). Left to mourn her passing
                        are her companion, Andy; four sons; Ernest of Romulus, Mich., Randolph of Westland, Mich, Frank

                        sister. Mom was a kind and Loving person, she was always thinking of us children and our needs.
                        In our times of hardships, mom would always want to know if we needed help from her and dad. She
                        didn't want us to do without the things we needed. I've always thought my parents were the best
                        anybody could have. We didn't have a lot of money, but we had and still have plenty of love for
                        each other. I've heard Elder Burt Howard say so many times around deaths and funerals that if a
                        person has the faith and believes, God will show them that there loved one is at rest. I've had
                        such beautiful dreams about my Mother, and I belive with all my heart that she's at rest. She's
                        a sleep in Jesus, waiting for that trumpet to sound so she can go home, where there will be no
                        more sickness and suffering. Our family sends out our thanks and love to all the beautiful
                        people who helped us in our time of need. A special thanks to Brother Morris Wicker and Brother
                        Jerry Manns; they stood by our family all the way. God bless both of you. I write this in Loving
                        memory of my precious mother, whom I will never forget as long as I live. Written by: Your
