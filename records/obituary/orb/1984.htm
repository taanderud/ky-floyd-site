<p align="left "><font size="2 ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial ">"But I would n</font>ot have you to be ignorant, brethern, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope." I Thess. 4:13.<br> When we think of death, we think of sorrow, as those without hope. Sleep in death, one can't be troubled,
    when you sleep.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister Carrie, an aunt of mine, by marriage, was born to the late Kell and Jane Johnson Draughn on August 26,1892, being 91 years old, when the death angel call her Home on December 7, 1983. She was married to
    David Fair Slone November 29, 1909 of Raven, Kentucky, in Knott County. She is survived by three sons, Delzie of Jeffersonville, Ind., Roy Slone of LaGrange, Ohio and Ernest Slone of Dayton. Ohio. Five daughters, Lora Dobson and Mae Gibson of Raven,
    and Ruie Sturgell of Titusville, Florida. Twin daughters, Allie Gibson of Marion Ohio and Ollie Terry of LaGrange, Ohio. Two brothers, Troy and Leslie Draughn, one sister Rettie Watts of Garner, Kentucky. Two children died in infancy, two sons, Merrit
    Slone of LaGrange, Ohio and Clemon Slone of Raven, and one daughter Elsie Moore proceeded her in death. She was blessed to have 32 grandchildren.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aunt Carrie joined the Caney Fork Regular Baptist Church at Raven, Kentucky in
    Knott, County the third Sunday in May 1920. She was baptized by Elders Lindsey Mosley and her father-in-law, Morgan Slone. She loved children, her first concern was to offer them food, or anyone else when they visited her. I have many fond memories
    of her, during my childhood.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her delight was in the Lord, tho, she wasn't able to attend church always, she was dedicated to read "what saith the Word of God". As the years passed on, she lost her hearing to a great degree,
    but you never had to worry about it, when you visited her. She had so much to tell you, about the goodness of the Lord, and how she loved Him, you would never be lost for words, all you needed to do was just listen. You would leave with your Faith
    re-newed, you wouldn't be with her very long until her conversation was about the Lord.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How precious to know that the God who is with us in this life, is with us in death, how precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of
    His Saints. Psm. 116:15. A hope in Christ is something real, for He is our hope. Paul speaks of this hope as something real and confident. A confident expectation that to be absent from the body, is to present with the Lord. He has claimed victory
    over death for us. The person, who has no hope in death, has no hope in life either. Death brings immediate sorrow, but that gives way to Eternal Joy in the very presence of God! James describes death as the body without the Spirit, What a blessing
    for the Chrisitan who dies with the expectation of being present with the Lord!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those who do not know Jesus Christ, as your personal Savior, in Aunt Carrie's family, my prayers are that you will be washed by His precious-eternal
    blood, being born again, that Heven will be your home, when this life is over. May God bless Lora, who worked and labored, careing so faithfully for her mother. The family wishes to thank all members and friends of the Caney Fork Church, where she
    was a member. Also, her name is on the list at the Pleasant View Church at Litchfield, Ohio where her daughter Ollie is a member. That is held each year in June. God Bless you all.<br>

            <b><u>HATTIE BRADLEY</u></b><br>

            <br> By the help of the good Lord, I will try to write the obituary of my dear wife, Hattie Bradley, who passed away and left me on June 12, 1984. Hattie Bradley was the daughter of the late John C. Stewart and Caroline Martin Stewart, born
            February 23, 1903 at Minnie, Kentucky and was married to Green Bradley in the month of September 1926. Our union of marriage the Lord blessed us with four children, three boys and one daughter U. G. Bradley deceased, Rudolph, deceased, James
            D. Bradley, Wayland, Kentucky and Avonelle Blondell, Wayland, Kentucky. Hattie was the grandmother of eight and had five great-grandchildren, she also had four greatgreat grandchildren.<br> Hattie also has three brothers now living and four
            sisters also living. Robert Stewart, Woodrow Stewart, of California, and Walter Stewart of California, Lula Moore of Martin, Kentucky, Ida Higgins of Minnie, Kentucky, Deloris of Ohio, and Delma Mullins of Pennsylvania.<br> Hattie joined the
            Old Regular Baptist Church in the year of 1934 and remained a faithful member until she passed away. We have labored and journeyed together for 58 years while she was on this earth and have seen many sorrows and heart aches, but God blessed
            us on earth with a long life. I believe that while her passing away brought me sorrow, it brought her joy. Some sweet day we will meet again, not as of man and wife but as the angels around the throne of God, where peace and joy abounds forever.
            I want to say to our children and grandchildren that when they say good-bye, if they die in their sins that I feel it will be forever.<br>

            <br> It is with very much sadness I write the obituary of my deceased husband, James Campbell. He was born February 2, 1904, deceased February 25, 1984, making his days on earth eighty years and twenty-three days. The son of Joe and -,Lizzie
            Campbell, he was raised by his grandparents and uncles of Knott County.<br> He was first married to Edith Meade. To this union was born six lovable children. Daniel Campbell, Allen, Kentucky, Garnard Campbell of East Point, Kentucky, James
            Clinis Campbell of LeGrande, Indiana, Anna Lea Frazier of St. Mary's, Ohio, Thelma Hale of Risner, Kentucky and Rita Fay Smith of Allen, Kentucky.<br> Edith Campbell passed away in 1961. He was later married to Dixie Click Campbell on December

            and Alvin Osborne. He took his fellowship at Bethel Old Regular Baptist Church. '<br> He retired from the C &amp; 0 Railroad as a brakeman in 1970. After a lengthy illness he was admitted to the hospital February 15, 1984. In passing he leaves
            a loving wife and children, also many friends. We feel our loss is Heaven's gain and although we are saddened without him, it is comforting to know he is in God's loving care. He will be missed very deeply.<br>

            <br> It is with sadness and sorrow that I will try to write the obituary of our dear beloved mother, Belle Moore.<br> She was the daughter of the late Von and Nancy Moore of McDowell, Kentucky. She was born December 15, 1905, at Dema, in Knott
            County and passed away September 9, 1983 at her home in Willowick, Ohio.<br> She married Hawk Moore, son of Albert and Emma Stumbo Moore on May 3, 1928. To this union was born six children. A daughter, Lois Jean, preceded her in death on July
            2, 1937; also her husband, Hawk, preceded her in death on October 12, 1952. Left to mourn her loss are one son, Paul Dean Moore, of Mentor on-the lake, Ohio; four daughters: Loraine Robinson of Newton Falls, Ohio; Anita Robinson of Willowick,
            Ohio; Lola Velotta of Willowick, Ohio and Rexene Caudill of Wayland, Kentucky. Two brothers: Alvin Moore of McDowell, Kentucky; Arthur Moore of Louisa, Kentucky; one brother, Orbin Moore, of McDowell, Kentucky, passed away on May 8, 1984.
            Mom had fifteen grandchildren and ten great grandchildren who loved her dearly.<br> Mom became a member of the Steel's Creek Regular Baptist Church on April 4, 1954, where she was a faithful member for 29 years. Although Mom had been a resident
            of Ohio since 1957, she looked forward to coming back home to go to church as long as she was able. The last few years of her life, she didn't get to come very often because of ill health, but her heart was here. Mom would listen to the tapes
            that I had taped for her in church and she would get such joy listening to the singing and preaching. Mom was loved by everyone that knew her, friends, neighbors, relation and her brothers and sisters in the Lord. One of the happiest days
            of my life was when I got down on my knees to wash my mother's feet and she washed mine.<br> It will soon be a year since our Mom passed away but it seems like only yesterday. She was our guiding light and she always taught us right from wrong.
            We thank God for the precious memories we have of her. She is happy now in her new home, where there is no more pain or death, just peace and joy forever more, in that beautiful land called Heaven. I hope and pray we will all see our Mom again.<br>

            <br> By request of the family and by the help of the Lord, I will try in my weakness to write an obituary of Mary Vina Mae Tackett. Mary was born September 26, 1964. The daughter of Brother Denver and Sister Lula Tackett of Halo, Kentucky
            and died November 22, 1983 making her stay on earth 19 years, 1 month and 26 days.<br> Leaving to mourn her passing are her father and mother, 3 brothers, Scott, Amos and David all of Halo, Kentucky, 2 sisters, Lucille Gayheart of Halo and
            Betty Cook of Buckingham, Kentucky. She also leaves many relatives and friends.<br> So I say to all that read this obituary, the young are dying as well as the old. We have no promise of tomorrow. My advice to the young people is this, as
            the Lord said, "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God and their is none else." The Lord also said, "I even I, am the Lord, and besides me, there is no Savior."<br> So Brother Denver and Sister Lula I know your
            heart has been made sad again in this world. I'm glad the Lord said, " In this world you shall have trouble but in me you may find peace." But God is so good. He gave His only begotten Son that who so ever believeth in Him should not perish,
            but have everlasting life.<br> On the night of her accident, she appeared to me in a dream. The most beautiful robe I ever saw, she asked me to go with her. I told her I couldn't at that time but she said she would be back again. I say to
            her brothers and sisters, I believe by God's great mercy, that God heard her cries and I believe someday I will meet her.<br>

            who preceded him in death. To this union was born 2 sons. He later married Dolly Case Branham and to this union was born 10 children - 3 baby daughters preceded Dad in death. Left to mourn his loss is Mom, who Dad cared and treasured for 57
            years, six sons and three daughters - Elzie Branham of Largo, Indiana; Johnny Branham of Dinwiddy, Virginia; Carlos Branham of Williard, Ohio; Malcom and Donald of Plymouth, Ohio; Ronnie Branham of Mansfield, Ohio; Arcolas Goble and Hazel
            Chaffins of Willard, Ohio; and Addie Langley of Henderson, Kentucky. Dad has 6 brothers who all preceded him in death except for 1 - Ross Branham of Paintsville, Kentucky. Dad was blessed to have 29 grandchildren and 22 great grandchildren.
            Dad joined the Old Regular Baptist Church about 55 years ago. He was ordained as a deacon at the Little Dove Church in Honaker, Kentucky the 4th Saturday in June, 1935. He brought his letter to the Little Rebecca Church when he came to this
            part of the country to live 25 years ago. Dad was a faithful member and filled his seat as long as he could and even sometimes when he was not able. I feel the church will miss him greatly. Dad loved the old time way - he loved order in the
            church and he stood firm on what he felt and believed was the old time way and would keep order in the church. He hated to see new things come in that would change that.<br> I was blessed for the past 3 months to have Dad in my home with the
            help of my sister Arcolas and a daughter-in-law to Dad, Gracie, who was so precious to him - he loved her like his own daughter.&nbsp;<br> I have many precious memories of Dad - I will miss Dad calling for me, but there is going to be a call
            in that morning when the trumpet sounds that Dad and I will answer together. 1 feel and believe that we'll board that cloud and go home together.<br> To the children, the grandchildren, the great grandchildren and friends - you can see Dad
            again if you want to but first you must lay down the sinful things of this world, repent and be born again - then you will be made a fit subject for Heaven. I feel our loss is Heaven's gain.<br>

            home to her heavenly Father January 11th, 1983 making her visit here on earth 73 years, 7 months and two days. Mom was married to John P. Honaker in June of 1942, and to this union was born her only child, Mary E. Honaker Bryant of Norwalk,
            Ohio with whom she had lived for the past few years. After Dad died in February of 1951, Mom married the Elder Jonah Issacs who also proceeded her in death.<br> Mom gave her life over to the Lord when she was only 19 years of age. Mom was
            a charter member of the Little Nancy church at Hi Hat, Kentucky. Mom lived a true and faithful life to the very end. Mom loved going to church and seeing her brothers and sisters and had gone to church the week-end before she died. I will
            regret as long as I live that I was not with her at church that last time. I was told by my cousins how happy she was that Sunday, and how she shouted all over the church house. Mom was as happy and faithful serving God seven days a week as
            she was on Sunday. I well remember when I was a very small child how she would wake Dad and me with her shouting and praising God.<br> The Sunday evening before Mom died she told me as she had so many times before, Mary I am ready to die and
            I am not afraid, so please don't worry about me just get yourself ready to meet me in Heaven some day. When I found her dead in bed on that Tuesday morning, she was so peaceful looking that everyone including the nurse and policeman that came
            when we called the ambulance, said "They had never seen anyone die so peaceful in all their years on duty". I knew that she had just gone home to be with her Heavenly Father, whom she had served so many years.<br> My mother never had a lot
            of money to leave me, but she left me the greatest gift a mother could leave her child. That is the gift of teaching me they way to eternal life through Jesus Christ, whom she served every day of her life. I only wish I had taken this gift
            and used it wisely before she died. I know that would have made her happier then any gift that I bought her. I can never live the spotless life my mother lived, but I pray that someday by the grace and forgiveness of God that I may be able
            to see her again.<br> Mom leaves to mourn her loss, one daughter, Mary Bryant of Norwalk, Ohio. Two grandsons Carl Hamilton, of Ipswich, England, and Stephen Hamilton of California, one granddaughter Rosemary Cooper of Green Springs, Ohio.
            Three great granddaughters, two great grandsons and was preceeded in death by one grandson. She also leaves one sister Pearlie Adams of Frankfort, Kentucky and one brother H. L. Bryant of Martin, Kentucky.<br> Mom told me so many times, "Mary,
            please don't worry about me when I am gone, I will be walking those streets of purest gold, just repent and join me there so our family can be together again.<br> I will never get over the loss of my mother, but I thank God for sharing her
            with me for 39 years.<br>

            <br> On March 5, 1925 in the house of Johnie and Stella Stegall a son was born. This son was named Joseph Willard Stegall. In the year of 1954, Joe met and fell in love with Billie Lou Yates and on December 18, 1954 they were united in marriage
            and to this union 6 children were born, Billie Jo Stegall of Hi Hat, Kentucky, Norma Kay Fairchild of Hi Hat, Kentucky, Lisa Gail Slone of McDowell, Kentucky and Debbie, Stan and Gwen all at home. Three sisters, and one brother along with

            of Hi Hat, Kentucky and three grandchildren who he dearly loved Matthew and Amanda Slone and Jessica Fairchild. Joe was a veteran of World War I I, and served in the Army Branch of services. Joe was a coal miner for 26 years, a member of the

            To you the family I will close this obituary by saying, be good to your mother, be good to one another, and love one another. Soon we will all be in the ground and this world will mean nothing. Trust in the Lord and even death has no power
            over you. Joe is in the hands of a kind. just, and merciful God no one could ask for more.<br>

            <br> With a broken heart and a deep feeling of loss I'll try to write an obituary of my husband, Andy Gibson, better known as "Son". He was the first born son of Ben and Peggy Caudill Gibson, and was born May 8, 1918 and died June 1, 1984
            after a long illness.<br> He has four sisters living, Nancy Hall, Josie Slone, Nebraska Mullins, and Neola Meade, seven sisters deceased, Alice, Susanna, Florency, Clercia, Virsie and twin infant sisters, Virdee and Virnie. He has two brothers
            living, Leonard and Daniel, and four brothers deceased, Bill, Miles, Maynard and Sylvester.<br> Son was a good husband, son, son-in-law, brother, uncle and a true friend to so many. He was always a hard worker, and could be depended on to
            lend a helping hand whenever he was needed.<br> He wasn't able to attend Church like he wanted because of severe caugh-<br> ing spasms. Like his father before him he believed in the Old Regular Baptist. In the summer of 1981 he was seriously
            ill at the V.A. Hospital in Lexington. The doctors did not think he would live. He told me then that, however, God wanted it, he would be satisfied. He came home and it was God's will that he live three more years for which I'll always be
            thankful for.<br> We were blessed to have thrity seven years together. Precious memories mean so much, and my hope is that my husband is at peace with our blessed Lord. I pray we will meet again some sweet day.<br> I, his brothers, sisters,
            neices, nephews, in-laws and friends will always love and miss him.<br>

            as long as she lived .<br> She always wanted to see that everybody had something to eat who came to see her. I can say from my heart that Mother was sure a good Christian and a wonderful Mother to her children. Surely a person as good as Mother
            was is with the angels around the throne of God. Mother lived with me for 22 years but she is gone where there will be no more strokes or heartaches for her anymore.&nbsp;</font>

            one morning so sad and unhappy, I asked her what was wrong. She had dreamed of climbing a ladder, the higher she got the prettier it was, she awoke before she got to the top she wanted to get higher. I told her, Mom someday you will make it

            <br> I will try by the help of the Lord and having a knowledge and understanding of my father-in-law, Gordon L. Newsome, to write the appropriate, descriptive words of his life.<br> Gordon was born in Pike County, Kentucky, December 7, 1908,
            to Floyd and Hulda Jane Newsome and deceased June 1, 1984 having been blessed with 75 years, 5 months and 25 days on earth.<br> Cordon's second child, Ada Marie preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife Mollie, one son, Feddie three
            daughters, Opal Newsome, Mrs. Palmer R. (Beatrice) Hamilton and Mollie Mae Newsome all of Marshall, Michigan; one foster-daughter, Mrs. Holdred (Spicy) McPeek of Virgie, Kentucky; two grandchildren, one great grandchild, eight foster-grandchildren,
            and nine foster great grandchildren; one brother Garland Newsome of Caney Creek, Kentucky; one sister, Draxie Reynolds of Penny, Kentucky; three half-brothers Sterling Newsome, Epp Newsome, and Wade Newsome all of Marlany; three half-sisters,
            Mrs. Wilson (Jane ) Piper and Mrs. Earl (Susie) Jennings both of Pennsylvania, and Mrs. Rhondina Hamilton of Robinson, Kentucky.<br> An ardent worker, Cordon had devoted his work life to the coal mines, first as an employee and then as an
            employer undoubtedly enduring many hard-ships that go with this type of work.<br> Cordon was not a member of any church, however, he professed a hope in Christ and often attended the Old Regular Baptist, the denomination he enjoyed most. Occasionally
            he and I would discuss the scriptures and church affairs.<br> A well content man, Cordon possessed characteristics which added to his life's satisfaction. He was very strong mentally and physically, very calm, able to ignore past errors and
            move forward, and had a thorough understanding and acceptance of life's trials and expectations.<br> I believe individuals lives are exemplified in their children and this is one family I have observed for the past twenty-one years who have
            always corresponded much better than the average family. They are not ashamed, bashful or backward when it come to expressing their love and appreciation for each other. A man blessed with the ability to make sound judgments, the ability to
            communicate well, Gordon would capture the admiration of people with the enjoyable conversations one could have with him. Again, the ability to be wholly at ease made him better able to get peoples attention and made him an enjoyable person
            to be around.<br> Gordon and Mollie left their home in Kentucky in 1966 to be with their children in Michigan but I believe that perhaps God granted his request by taking him during his last visit to Kentucky.<br> We don't want to lose our
            loved ones and it takes time to recover, but, the greatest feeling is believing they are resting in Paradise with Jesus and we the family don't have any doubt about Gordon.<br>

            <br> Our blessed mother was born June 27, 1908 and she left us November 27, 1983, being 75 years old and a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church more than 40 years. Mom left behind four sons and one daughter who miss her very much: Paul
            and Pearlie, Jr., of Pippa Passes; Charlie of Garner; Dewey, of Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Gertie Watson of Martin. She had 14 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. Also, two brothers and four sisters along with a host of friends and relatives
            remain who miss her very much.<br> Although Mom was only 38 when our Dad, Pearlie Short, died, she never remarried. She had six children<br> of her own and a niece of Dad's, Grethel (Tootsie) to raise. Times were hard, but Mom did all she
            could and<br> there was always plenty of love. -<br> Our Mother had been sick for some time, but was able to go until about a month before she died. Mom told me and the boys many times that she was ready to go. The last time she went into
            the hospital, she told us that she was going "Home" for she had dreamed that our Daddy had come to the hospital, stood by her bed and told her that he had come to take her back to Heaven. Many times she told us about this dream as she lay
            in the hospital. Then, on Thanksgiving Day, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Lexington, she told us that she would not be here much longer. The next day, my brother, Charlie and I were by her bedside, and she was holding onto both of my hands praying
            for the Lord to take her "Home". As if in answer to her prayer, the machinery suddenly stopped and her spirit was gone from us.<br> Each time when Mom was sick, I would pray, "Lord, let us keep her a little longer if it will be your blessed
            will." I knew that I was being selfish; but I loved her so. He loved her even more. I know our loss is Heaven's gain. One of Mom's favorite songs was "Just One Rose Will Do," and I feel that when God chose our mother, He chose the biggest,
            most beautiful rose of all.<br> We had you for 75 years and we made enough memories for a lifetime. Memories of you are everyplace. Our hearts are sad because we can no longer see your face, but we rejoice -in knowing that you are with Jesus
            and those gone on before.<br> Everyone who knew her loved our Mother, especially little children; some would even call her "Mama Lula." She will be remembered for the love and kindness she shared with her friends and family. There was always
            a quick, sweet smile on her face, a sparkle in her eye, a crackle in her laughter, and love in her heart. No wonder we miss you so.<br>

            Ishmal Sparkman, Andy Sparkman, Francis Sparkman and Inis Jacobs.<br> Brother Troy's companion passed away at a fairly young age, and he was then married to Nannie Slone, and they had five sons and three daughters: Billy B. Sparkman, George
            Sparkman, Harliss Sparkman, Sampie Sparkman, Vansel Sparkman, Allie Jacobs, Vina Tuttle and Allyene Slone. Two sons, Andy and Billy B. and one daughter, Francis had preceded Brother Troy in death. Other survivors include one brother, John
            and one sister, Allie Bentley, 38 grandchildren and 21 great grandchildren with many other relatives and friends.<br> While still a young man, Bro. Troy felt the need for a saviour in his life, and began to seek for a better home. In the year
            of 1933, he was baptized into the fellowship of the Mount Olive church, and shortly after he professed a call to preach the gospel of Christ. For more than forty years he was faithful to his calling. He traveled far and near, walking over
            mountains and up the creeks and hollows. Wherever there was sickness or death, you would find Brother Troy trying to help and comfort in any way he could.<br> God had blessed Brother Troy to live along and a full life in this world but the
            time finally came for him to depart, but I trust his family will comfort themselves with the lifetime of good memories which he left them. I believe that as the last breath left his body, there was a door opened in another world, and he heard
            the singing of the angels. I believe that when the trumpet sounds he will get up and go shouting down the golden streets of Heaven with all the redeemed of the King.<br>

            She would tell us that she felt so good after they visited her. The doctors had said she wasn't strong enough to have visitors and had told us to keep everyone out except the immediate family, but we knew how much she loved to be with her

            <br> It is with a sad and heavy heart that I try to write an obituary of my wonderful companion, America Damron Kidd. She was born August 25, 1910 and deceased this life December 16, 1983, making her stay here on earth 73 years, 3 months and
            21 days. She was the daughter of the late Spurrell Damron and Eveline Kidd Damron. She was the mother of 4 children-2 preceded her in death. My companion and sister in hope of eternal life took sick in June was taken to the hospital and while
            there about 7 days talking with our daughter-in-law and me said she wasn't going to get well and wanted me to write the preachers down that she wanted to preach over her, then after she got out of the hospital that time we would talk a lot
            about death. She always would say she wouldn't live to see Christmas. There was 6 of the girls living on October 8, 1983 when we had to take my companion America to the Highlands Regional Medical Center Hospital where she stayed until October
            28 when she was taken to Central Baptist Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, where she stayed until her death on December 16, 1983. Between October and December my companion lost 2 sisters. Her sister, Rena Hughes, which died October 26 and Della
            Case, which died November 4, 1983. Sister America leaves her husband, Mack Kidd, Jr., 1 daughter, Margrene Kidd Newsome, 1 son, Calip Lee Kidd, 3 sisters, Mrs. Mae Case, Mrs. Masil Collins, Miss Alpha Damron, 6 grandchildren and a host of
            friends and relatives to mourn her passing. Sister America joined the Little Dove Church of Jesus Christ of Regular Baptist on July 25, 1952, and was baptized by Elder J. P. Hall. She was a christian over 31 years. I, Mack Kidd, Jr., being
            the clerk of that church now for 18 years and knowing my companion's life, she was humble and obedient to christian virtues and would ask me to read the Bible to her so she could be more able to teach her children and the young women how to
            live a Christian life. She enjoyed going to church as long as she was able. She did not hesitate to call the attention of others when she thought they were doing wrong. She would talk about Job where he wrote man that is born of a woman is
            of few days and full of trouble. Also 19 chapter and 25 verse, "For I know that my Redeemer liveth and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth, and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God,
            whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another." Sister America said, "I can say as the Apostle Paul said, I have finished my course, I have fought a good fight, I have kept the Faith. There is a crown of righteousness
            which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but to all them that love his appearing." If my companion could speak back to us, I know what she would say. She would say, "Children my worries are over and
            if you want to see your mother again you have to forsake all sin and repent and live for Jesus Christ and meet me in Heaven on that Ressurection Day." While my companion was in the hospital she was on a life support respirator with a tube
            in her throat so that made it impossible for her to talk, but we would ask her something and she would nod her head. She knew up until she was taken from us. Why I can say this is the day she died we went in and Calip said," Mama, we are all
            here," and she noded yes. Then I asked for a kiss and she kissed me so I know she knew us. When her friends and loved one would come to see her she would smile and reach her hand. This obituary is getting long but I haven't said half of the
            good things about my companion that could be said. This is from a song she always wanted to help me sing; Dear friends, farewell, I do you tell since you and I must part, I go away and here you stay but still we're joined in heart. Your love
            to me has been most free, your conversation sweet; how can I bear to journey where with you I cannot meet. Oh, how much we all did love her, and did all we could do, to try to keep her with us, for she we did not want to lose. But at the silent
            hour, 4:22 p.m., December 16, 1983, with hearts so full of pain I saw my dear love one leave us. While I was holding to her hand but with her we'll live again. God sent down a Holy Angel on wings to bear her across the river home, we stood
            by so helpless while she left us here alone. We followed her to the graveyard, with heads bent down so low, while in Heaven she's with Jesus walking on the streets of Gold.<br>

            88 years, 9 months and 2 days. She was the daughter of the late Alfred Damron and Mary Kinney Damron.<br> She was first married the late Moody Elswick, they were blessed with two children Ada Trivette who survives and Lean Elswick, deceased.

            great grandchildren.<br> She joined the Old Regular Baptist Church August 1940, at Enterprise on Indian Creek where she was a faithful member 44 years.<br> Mother become a wheelchair patient the last few years of her life. She spent the last
            6 months with her daughters Mae &amp; Ruby Wright, I would often go in where she was sitting and she would be talking and no one would be in the room. She was talking to her Savior about her children, she wanted them to be ready to go home.
            She knew her time was nearing, the morning God called her when I went into her room she said honey the dawn is breaking. I feel with all my heart she saw her future home. When the death angel took her from us I feel God was waiting on the
            banks of Jordan to carry Mother across. Children Mother lift a bright light in the window for us to follow her home. If we want to live with Mother forever we must follow Jesus, obey his commandments all the way and be faithful until the end
            as Mother did.<br> Yes, I miss Mother the burden seems heavy to bear but when I remember how good God was to give me such a wonderful Mother for all those many years and made it possible that I can go be with her forever I can't help but shout
            and thank Him for saving such a little creature like me. Let me know the sweetness of His son Jesus that Mother knew. She would often tell me about him coming and staying with her when us children was smaller. She told me she had ate at the
            table with the diciples after she got disabled to go to church.<br> Clyde and I would go to church come back, stop and I would cook dinner and visit, sometimes Mother would say when we come in I know you all had a good meeting because I felt
            it, I had a good one at home.<br> I will close by saying if you want to see Mother again paick up the cross and follow Jesus so you won't have to cross Jordan alone.<br>

            for so long.<br> Sissy lived more life and touched more peoples' hearts in her short life than most people do who live to be old. The song "Precious Memories" has more meaning now than ever before, because now every memory of Sissy is more
            precious than ever. All we have left of Sissy is memories and I thank God for every memory we have. I pray that someday we canmeet Sissy on that beautiful shore and see that happy face once again.<br>

</u></b><br> With a sad and lonely heart, I will try to write an obituary of our loved one, Curtis Little. He was born April 12, 1909 in Pike County, Kentucky. He passed from this life July 23, 1984 making his stay on earth 75 years, 3 months and 11 days.
            He was the son of the late Marion Little and the late Minerva (Johnson) Little. He was married to Margarette Burke on March 17, 1932 they were married for over 52 years. To this union were born five children, three sons: James and Eugene Little
            both of Virgie, Royce Little of Ecorse, Michigan and two daughters: Joy Jones and Edna Johnson both of Virgie. Nine grandchildren: Ricky, Areta, Ronald, Sharon, Tony, Roberta, Randy, Michele and Angora. Two sisters: Pearl Hall and Allie Burke
            both of Virgie.<br> He leaves to mourn his loss his wife, children, grandchildren, two sisters and a host of friends and relatives. In September 1966, he joined the Old Regular Baptist Church and lived a good Christian life until God called
            him home. He had been ill for sometime, but his illness didn't keep him from going to church whenever he could.<br> We love and miss him very much.<br>

            have us call the Elders to come and sing a song and hold prayer for her. Her favorite song was Amazing Grace.<br> She told us that she didn't want to be taken back to the hospital, and that she wanted her family to take care of her, at home.

            <br> Harvey Tackett was born on October 22, 1908, on the Long Fork of Shelby Creek in Pike County, Kentucky. He was the son of the late Willie and Mindy Tackett. He departed this life June 1, 1984 at the home that he loved so much at the age
            of 75 years, 7 months and 9 days.<br> He was married to Naomi Hudson, November 26, 1925. To this union was born 15 children. Six children precede him in death.<br> The first two sons to die was Eugene, which he always called "little Gene",
            and Martin Van Buren, whom he affectionately called "Brother Boy." Bro. Harvey was like the old servant Jacob when he thought his son Joseph was dead. Jacob said, "I'll go to my grave mourning the death of my son."<br> These precious little
            boys was on Bro. Harvey's mind in the last days and hours of his life. The Lord let him get a view of these little boys as death drew near. What a comfort this must have been to him! His other babies died as infants.<br> In addition to his
            wife, Naomi, he is survived by three sons: Emzy Tackett of Virgie, Kentucky, J.C. Tackett of Inkster, Michigan, Douglas Tackett of Virgie, Kentucky and 6 daughters: Lillie Hager of West Liberty, Kentucky, Ilma Miller of Xenia, Ohio, Betty
            Little of Inkster, Michigan, Flora Brickey of Xenia, Ohio, Jackie Johnson of Myra, Kentucky, and Wilma Hail of Virgie, Kentucky<br> He is also survived by 29 grandchildren and 17 great grandchildren whom he loved very much.<br> He is survived
            by two brothers: Estil Tackett of Ohio and Orlando Tackett of Michigan, and three sisters: Marie Carter of Pikeville, Kentucky, Lola Elswick of Michigan, and Bertha Tackett of Virgie, Kentucky. He is also survived by many nieces, nephews and
            other relatives and friends.<br> He had such a winning manner about him. Bro. Harvey joined the Long Fork Baptist Church the fourth Saturday in May, 1958, and after telling a wonderful experience of grace he was baptized by Elder Mark Burke
            and Elder Jonah Tackett. From that day forward to up build the Old Regular Baptist Church was uppermost in his mind.<br> On the fourth Saturday in December 1960 he was found qualified and worthy to be ordained as a deacon. He fulfilled his
            charge as a deacon faithfully, courageously, everly striving for a clean church and the Old time ways as it once was delivered to the saints.<br> He came in the aim to establish The Pilgrim Hope Church and devoted many, many hours of prayer
            and labor for its up build.<br> One of the great joys of his life was having his wife, 2 sons, 5 daughters and 4 son-in-laws to join with him in serving the Lord.<br> For the family that has not an experience of grace with the Lord, Daddy
            left very plain footprints on the sands of time and his life as a light to show you the way.<br> From the day, Bro. Harvey felt that the Lord came into his heart he never once looked back or longed for the things of the world but pressed forward
            in the service of the most high God, sometimes through tears, pain, labor and heavy burdens. He was everly pressing toward that great meeting with the Lord that he had last Friday morning at daybreak.<br> As death drew near last week and he
            was finishing up his earthly life, he seemed to try to tell Naomi and each child just once more that he loved them.<br> As he looked back over his life in those last hours the song Precious Memories seemed to sum it all up. He asked Bro. Junior
            Damron to sing it for him. Bro. Harvey said it sounded so pretty and good to him.<br> Children, you know how Daddy wanted all you children to be at home with him. Daddy said many times he was going home. Are you all going to strive to meet
            Daddy there?<br>

            <br> It is with a feeling of sadness and great loss that we attempt to write an obituary of our precious mother, Mae Newsom. Mom was born on November 27, 1911, departed this life on August 27, 1984, making her stay on earth 72 years and 9
            months. Mom was the daughter of the late Farrow and Betty Tackett Bryant. Mom married Estile Ted Newsom on January 28, 1933, unto this union was born seven (7) children, one preceded her in death, James Estile, died as an infant. Mom was preceded
            in death by her husband, Estile Ted, who died on May 7, 1982; two sisters, also preceded her in death, Martha Younce and Arizona Tackett.<br> Mom leaves to mourn her loss four (4) sons: Tivis, Bobby Gene, and Paul Dean, all of Little Robinson
            Creek, Kentucky, Clifford of Elkhorn City, Kentucky, two (2) daughters: Glenda Faye Akers, of Little Robinson Creek, Kentucky, and Mildred Anderson of Chloe Creek, Kentucky. Seven (7) grandchildren, two (2) step-grandchildren, and one (1)
            great grandchild; one (1) sister Liza Flanary of Beaver, Kentucky and a host of friends and relatives.<br> Mom spent her last days here on earth at the St. Joseph Hospital at Lexington, Kentucky, where she had a short battle with cancer. Mom
            went to church regularly, but was not actually baptized; but we truly believe, as does Bro. Dewey Roberts, that Mom had accepted the Lord as her Saviour. Mom had a conversation with Dewey Roberts on Friday, a week before her death; she told
            Dewey that her name was in the Lamb's Book of Life.<br> We truly believe that our beloved Mother has joined Dad in Heaven, where they will never be separated again. By the grace of God, we can one day be with Mom and Dad, not on earth but
            in Heaven. Our great loss is Heaven's great gain.<br>

            with any little thing you would do for him. He loved mom and his children so very much.<br> Dad told Mom and I that he had to die because he had lived out his time. I asked him how did he know? "He said the Lord showed him, Mom asked him if
            he had a dream and he said no I had a vision," "I was going thru a dark canyon searching for the rock and the Lord showed me that I had found the rock and I was standing on it."<br> His grandson Lacy and his wife Edith was trying to get Dad
            to eat and he said that he didn't want that food because I will be filled soon with that spiritual food. Dad told me that he wanted to be baptized and so he joined The Old Regular Baptist Church and was baptized by the Brethern that he requested
            and his membership is a the Old Long Fork Regular Baptist Church. We believe that dad is in Heaven walking on the streets of pure gold. As time goes by we miss him so much and we hope to meet him in heaven when this life of ours is over.<br>

            stay was 90 years, 9 months and 6 days. He was preceded in death by his seven sisters to wit: Betty, Martha, El, Tilda Jane, Julie, Dotty and Bell. He was also preceded in death by five brothers to wit: Lawrence, Jeroid, Lewis, Perry and Irvin.
            He is survived by one brother, Jim Tackett of Floyd County, Kentucky.<br> On May 2, 1911, he was married to Abbie Hall. To this union was born four daughters. They all died as infants. Abbie passed away August 1920.<br> On October 20, 1920
            he was married to Lou Cole. To this union was one adopted daughter, Verda Tackett Fields, who survives. His second wife Lou, passed away January 8, 1967. On October 4, 1967 he was married to Mary Rogers Roberts.&nbsp;<br> In addition to his
            wife, Mary and daughter Verda he is survived by 6 grandsons - Homer Lee, Perry, Ernest, Earl, Jink and Billy, 13 great grandchildren and 5 great great grandchildren. He is also survived by one step daughter, Fretia Roberts and nine step sons
            to wit: Frank Roberts, Bennie Roberts, Arnold Roberts, Willie Roberts, Reed Roberts, Arlin Roberts, Joseph Roberts, Dewey Roberts and Cecil Roberts.<br> He entered the armed services during World War I to help defend his country, the United
            States of America.<br> He joined the Regular Baptist Church the third Sunday in August 1923 at the Island Creek Church. He was baptized by Elder Frank Hopkins. He was ordained as a deacon in 1928. He was a deacon of the Robinson Creek Regular
            Baptist Church at his death. As a deacon he firmly believed in and supported the doctrine and practice of the Old Regular Baptist.<br> From the dawn of that August in 1923 when he professed his hope in Christ and for over 60 years until December
            13, 1983 when life's lamp went out he never once looked back or longed for the things he had given up. Brother Lee moved forward with the faith of a martyr and the fortitude of a soldier. He perservided until he entered the haven of rest,
            won the crown for which he had labored, and met the God whom he adored.<br> Though he has passed over 90 milestones in the journey of life when he entered the undiscovered country from whose bounds no traveler returns, Brother Lee entered
            it fearlessly, knowing he had left all the thorns and tears behind.<br> When the death angel came for him he just went out to meet it. When the life boat departed loaded with the immortal soul of Brother Lee, it launched out upon the sea of
            glory. All was then peace and quiet. The soft blowing wind perfumed with the breath of flowers from the land of promise greeted the happy sailer. When the old ship of Zion anchored within the Port of Peace she landed another soul on the pearly
            shore of that beautiful vision of eternal repose.<br>

            <br> With the help of God, I will write the obituary of my dear companion; to wit, Julia Burke Breeding. She was the daughter of the late K. D. Burke and Sophia Isaac Burke, born May 13, 1918 and deceased March 28, 1984.<br> Julia was married
            to Irvin Breeding on April 20, 1935. To this union was born eight children; seven sons and one daughter. Three sons died in infancy, leaving four sons and one daughter. She also raised one grandson as her own. The surviving children are Estes
            Breeding of Westwood, Kentucky; Wesley Breeding of Greenup, Kentucky; Donald Ray Breeding of Charlotte North Carolina; Carl Edward Breeding of Munich, Germany; Carolyn Jewell Pennington of Lima, Ohio and Kyle Chad Breeding at home.<br> Julia
            was the fourth of nine children born to Sophia and Dave Burke. Surviving is her mother, Sophia Burke now of Greenup and six brothers and sisters. They are: Dwella May Hall of Greenup, Kentucky; Liza Jane Johnson of Halo, Kentucky; Garfield
            Burke of Halo, Kentucky; Walter Burke of Halo, Kentucky; Russell Burke of Bevinsville, Kentucky; and Daniel Burke of Worthington, Kentucky. Two sisters died in early childhood; Annie Burke and Maggie D. Burke.<br> Julia was a wonderful woman.
            There are many things I could say about Julia, but most church people knew her. Julia was sick a lot in the late fourties and early fifties. I heard her tell Brother Lloyd Mullins how she prayed to God to let her live long enough to see her
            youngest son raised to an age where he would remember her. She said that now that her son is 34 years old she should be willing to go.<br> Julia gave her hand to Elder Ellis Hopkins to become a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church, April,
            14, 1957, on the second Sunday. She was baptized on Apri120 by Elder Joe Burke and Elder Hobert Bates. Julia tried to tell her children of the danger of dying and going down to that place called Hell. Now that your mommy is gone, don't you
            all want to go to that city where the streets are pure gold and the walls are made of jasper and trouble can't come? Your mom tried her best to tell you all of the danger of dying and going down to tthat awful place where the worm dies not,
            and fire is not quenched. Children, don't you think you ought to be seeking God. He is one the forgiving hand. I want to say, be good to one another. I don't know how to close, so put your trust in God. He is great and greatly to be loved.<br>

            long after her death.<br> Sister Nancy was married to Culbert Thomas April 5th, 1924. Unto this union was born six children: Mrs. Nina Mozingo, Mrs. Shelby Bockover; sons Richard Thomas, all of Greensburg, and Gerald Gay of Ocoee, Florida
            and Gobel of Lancester, California. Lawrence C. died in infancy.<br> Sister Nancy, later followed in death by her good husband, leaves to mourn their passing five children, fourteen grandchildren, one great-grandchild, two sisters, (we think
            at this time) and numerous friends among the church.<br> Sister Nancy joined the Thornton Old Regular Baptist Church in Letcher County, Kentucky. She and good husband moved to Greensburg and bought a farm.<br> Brother Silas Frazier heard about
            these good people and told my wife to write them of The Little Pilgrims' Home Church located temporarily on Road 46 near Harrison, Ohio as at that time there were no other Old Regular Baptist Churches in this country. Sister Thomas came to
            our church by application, and remained a good and loyal member of this church until God took her from the earth. The children's Home Cemetery is the resting place of Sister Thomas' body until the Glorious Resurrection, when we believe, by
            the witness of her life among us, that she will arise with the children of God to go home to be with our Saviour.<br> Sister Thomas and husband, at first, rode the bus to get to the church. We have been to church many times in her home because
            there were no other Old Regular Baptist but ours in Indiana at this time. I was in the establishment of most of the churches in Indiana, but not until the Little Memory was established and an arm given for the establishment of the Children's
            Home, in later years, was there churches in Indiana to visit. We, therefore, met in our homes. Sister Thomas and her wonderful husband always managed to be with us, both people of great faith, although he never joined the visable body of true
            believers.
            <br> I surely trust, this obituary, of this dear mother and sister in Christ, will cause the children to follow the footsteps of this good,faithful mother, and press into the Kingdom of Christ by true repentance, for "Except a man be regenerated
            and born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."<br>

            also leaves 29 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren, and so many friends, her church brothers and sisters, her vacant seat no one can fill; and a great loss to all of us.<br> We cannot put into words the terrible shock and grief to her
            lovely family. She was such a good mother and was always trying to get her children to seek the Lord, and come to church. She loved to have the preachers visit her home to talk to her children, and she was always so kind and good to them.
            She loved to attend church, and was a loyal and faithful member of the Little Pilgrim Home Church for up in twenty years.<br> I wish to advise her children to keep close contact with each other because your mother and Dad would want this.
            Also, your parents left you an example and they have taught you the way. If you want to find the way that they sought and found, "Repent and you must be regenerated and born again." This is a MUST! No other way to get into that Glory World
            without the operation of God's Spirit. Only God can make a creature all over new to love the things he hated and to hate the things he loved. If you climb up by man's way, it will lead you astray. So ask of God, and permit him to lead you
            to "the house of his master's brethren." Two daughters belonged to her church.<br>

            <br> With a broken heart and much sadness I will try to write an obituary of my beloved daughter, Jewel or Judy as she was better known.<br> She was born January 1, 1930 and died November 24, 1983. Judy was afflicted from birth, having been
            born with a heart condition and later diabetes, loss of hearing but she bore her sickness with patience and never complained and tho she seldom left the house she enjoyed her life and was so much joy and comfort to me. She was so fond of her
            neices and nephews and always remembered their birthdays. She was like her name a precious jewel to all of us.<br> Her father Eite Gibson, her brother Carl and a nephew Stephen Gregory, preceded her in death. She leaves behind to mourn her
            loss her mother Lula, four sisters, Phyllis, Mildred, Mary Lou and Nancy. Three brothers, Marvin, Richard and Ronnie.<br> Judy will always be in our hearts but we feel she fell asleep in the arms of Jesus and her suffering is over.<br>

            <br> By request of his daughter, Effie, I will with the help of the good Lord, try to write an obituary of Brother Grover Moore, who was the son of Mart and Mandy Moore. Brother Grover was born September 20, 1901 and passed away on August
            29, 1984. He was married to Elsie Slone who proceded him in death in December 1980. To this union was born two children who are left to mourn his loss, Effie Salem of Raven, Kentucky and Arnold Moore of Legrange, Ohio. Surviving are four sisters
            - Mrs. Rosie Horton of New Port News, Va., Mrs. Ethel Robinson of W. Va., Mrs. Margaret Sparton of Mousie, Kentucky, and Mrs. Millie Reynolds, of Marion Ohio, and two brothers - Troy Moore of Wayland, Kentucky and Tom Moore of Marion, Ohio.
            Eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren will<br> greatly miss him.<br> Brother Grover joined the Old Regular Baptist Church 32 years ago and placed his membership at Caney Fork Church. Brother Grover would call me from the rest home
            at Prestonsburg to pick him up and bring him to church. He enjoyed going to church as long as he was able. I want to say to the family that I deeply feel in my heart, Brother Grover is at rest and if you want to see him again make ready while
            here on earth to meet him again. May God bless you all.<br>

            <br> It is with a broken heart I will try to write an obituary of my beloved brother, Marvin Earnest Hunter. Marvin was born 1940 to Craig and Mary Jane Hunter; Craig passed away in 1969 leaving his mother, Mary to mourn his loss. Marvin met
            and married Rosetta May Hamilton in 1960. They were blessed with one son, Marvin Jr., and five daughters, Sherry Lynn Palmer, Angie Hunter, Donna Sue Hunter, Jennifer, Myrtie Ann Hunter. Marvin loved his children very much and worked hard
            for them. He was a meat cutter at Krogers Meat Plant in Columbus, Ohio for about 16 years. Marvin belonged to the Little Ruth Church. He loved the church with all his heart. He wanted peace with all his brothers and sisters and wanted the
            church to prosper in love and peace. Marvin worked up until the day before he went into the hospital. He got very sick and thought he had the flu. He went to the hospital the next day and they told him he had less than three months to live;
            that was an awful time for all of us to accept. Marvin said he saw Jesus and John the Baptist they came into his room walking so softly. He was not afraid so he told mother not to worry, let Gods will be done. We stood by him in sorrow all
            week before he died. He talked to us up to an hour before he died. He looked up at Pearl and asked her to go with him. She said yes Marvin. He said I see a bunch of old time Brothers coming and Almighty God and Myrtie, then closed his eyes
            and went to rest. So children and Zete if you ever want to see Marvin again you must prepare yourself and get ready to go. Heaven is real and is worth everything to your soul. The last time I looked at Marvin at the church house, I said Brother
            I'll see you again. I feel that some sweet day it will be all over and Jesus will welcome His people home, no more cancer, no more troubles there will be peace, joy and love. May God hardest thing that I have ever tried to do. I loved him
            so much, but God loved him more. I want the kids and Marvin's wife to remember the many prayers he prayed for them and what he saw on his dying bed.<br> He said I see Old Time Brothers and children. It is the old time way. There is nothing
            new or modern going to Heaven. Let be clean and common and join together and remember The Old Regular Baptist. It is a great light and comfort to me. With great love for all of you.<br>

</b></u><br> It is with a very sad heart that I'll try to write an obituary of my sweet sister, Myrtie Hall Galliheir. Myrtie was born in 1920 to Craig and Mary Jane Hunter.<br> Myrtie met and married Azzie Hall. They were blessed with one daughter, Shirley
            Ann Leisure of Columbus, Ohio and five sons: Elmer Hall of Ohio, Stevie Hall of New London, Ohio, Gary Hall of Sunbury, Ohio, Lowell Gene Hall of Sunbury, Ohio. Edgel Hall and Myrtie's husband, Azzie Hall were killed in an awful train wreck
            in 1958 in New London, Ohio.<br> Later in life Myrtie met Harlow Galliheir and then married. They had one son, Billy Galliheir.<br> Myrtie belonged to the church of Old Regular Baptist for around thrity years and lived a good faithful life.
            She was one of the humblest people you will ever meet. She loved her children and always wanted the best for them.<br> Myrtie had that awful disease, cancer. She lived about three months after they found it. Myrtie told all of us not to worry
            about her, because she knew she could not live always and she was ready to go. She said she was going to be happy for what time she had left and she laughted and talked as much as she could.<br> Two nights before she died she said she was
            going to ride the Glory Bound Train. My sister ask her who told her she could go, she said my Lord told me so, she said yes I want to go. I feel Myrtie got on board and Jesus took her to rest. I know she would want me to tell her children
            to remember what she told you and pray to God for forgiveness and He will hear you. Someday you too can get on board that Glory Bound Train and see mother again.<br> It is very hard for all of us to accept. We have lost a very sweeet sister
            and mother. But God knows best, so prepare to meet her again children and her sweet grandchildren, she loved them so much and wanted the best for them. So be good to one another and serve the Lord. He is worth it all in the end. It would be
            very hard to come down to your dying bed and not be ready to meet Jesus, so children think and pray, God bless you all.<br>

            away on April 28, 1984. She was a daughter of the late Cleophus and Maggie Patrick Wicker, and was reared in the Lower Jones' Fork area of Knott County, Kentucky.<br> She is survived` by her husband, Merdie Hall of Puncheon, Kentucky; four
            sons: Wade, Tommy Wayne, Lowie and Michael Paul, all of Puncheon, Kentucky; two daughters: Janet Sturgill of Puncheon, Kentucky and Bonnie Lou Slone of Raven, Kentucky; one step-son: Hubert Hall of Connersville, Indiana; one step daughter:

            Hurt of Urbana, Indiana, Marie Davis of Connersville, Indiana, Opal Moore of Brazil, Indiana and Hazel Hicks of Lima, Ohio. Also surviving are eight grandchildren, two step grandchildren, and many friends to mourn her passing.<br> Early in
            life she met Brother Merdie Hall, and on August 13, 1949, they were married in Prestonsburg, Kentucky. Together they had many happy days. Although they worked very hard rearing their children, the time came when she started thing of the day
            that she would leave this world and face eternity before the Great Judge of all the earth. She realized a need for a Saviour and the only way she could find a Saviour was by looking to Jesus. Jesus said that He was the Savoiur of the world
            and a special Saviour to the believer. No doubt in my mind while Brother Merdie and the children were sleeping or out of the house, she would be praying to the Great God of Heaven to remove the burden of sin she was carrying.<br> I believe
            that when she became willing to give up her life that Jesus came to her rescue, and saved her soul and made it alive, and alive forever. On July 31, 1977, Sister Ima Lee and Brother Merdie joined the Old Regular Baptist and on August 13, 1977,
            (their 28th wedding anniversary), she and her husband were baptized into the fellowship of the Rebecca Church, at Kite, Kentucky, where she remained a faithful member until her passing.<br> Now the soul has moved out of her body and to a place
            called Paradise, resting until the morning when Jesus will leave Heaven with a shout and the voice of the arch angel and the trump of God and Jesus will call her name. She will answer that call and meet the Lord in the air and then forever
            be with the Lord.<br> On the day she was laid to rest, we returened home with our Daddy, and shortly thereafter we saw a rainbow colored light, which glowed briefly as bright as the sun, in the skies, which then slowly moved toward the east
            and out of our view, which leads us to believe that Mommy is at rest under the alter of God, awaiting the resurrection.<br> In closing, let me say that Mommy can't come back to us as she was, but by the grace of God, we can go where she is,
            by falling out with sin and calling on the same Saviour that Mommy called on. May God bless you all.<br> Among Mommy's papers we found after her death, the following:<br>

            Hall and Gladys Hall of Kite, Kentucky.<br> Dad was so lonely after Mom died. I think he was just counting the days until he could go to be with her.<br> Dad was a God fearing man. He loved to go to church, and did as long as he was able.
            He seemed to get so much joy from the good singing and preaching.<br> Dad worked hard all his life. He wanted a better life for his children.. He worked for Inland Steel Coal Co. for many years. Dad was sick for many years, but he never complained.
            He always said it was God's will.<br> Dad loved his children, granchildren and great grandchildren so much. He loved to have them come visit him. He would say to them, I'm not able to come to see you, but you can come see me.<br> Then on October
            12, Dad struck very ill. We took him to the hospital. He was never well enough to come home. One evening Dad was so bad, he wanted Ellis Holbrook and Abel Johnson to come to see him. Dad told them that he was ready to go and live with Jesus.
            We children knew our daddy was all right with the Lord.<br> It made us so happy when he told the preachers that there was nothing between him and his Lord, and that he was going to live with Jesus.<br> On October 27, 1983, the death angel
            came and took our Daddy home to live with Jesus, where all is peace and love.<br> So children if we want to see Mom and Dad again we have to make ourselves ready to go meet them in that glorious land where there is no sickness or pain, just
            peace and love.<br>

One stepdaughter survives, Rose Bentley, Millstone, Kentucky.<br>            Brother Elbert will also be missed by many friends and neighbors and his brothers and sisters in the church. We believe our loss here on earth is heavens gain.<br> Brother Elbert saw his lost condition and the need of a Saviour more than thirty
            years ago. In the year 1954, after many tearful prayers he told the church he felt the Lord had saved his soul and he wanted a home in the Old Regular Baptist Church. The brethren gladly received him and he lived a faithful servant until the
            Lord called him home.<br> A few years after Brother Elbert joined the church he felt another calling and began to preach. In 1962 he was ordained to the ministry. Early in Brother Elberts ministry he had a strong voice to sing and to declare
            the goodness of Jesus to a people that stood in need of a saviour.<br> Time and disease took Brother Elbert's health and he suffered much the last few years but in all his afflictions Brother Elbert never lost sight of heaven and that beautiful
            home the Lord had prepared for him.<br> On Sunday, August 5th, 1984, I feel the Lord saw Brother Elberts suffering was more than he could bear and God sent a band of angels to receive his soul into a place of rest.<br> We lay the body to mold
            back to the dust from whence it came, but God has a day set in which he will call to the sleeping dust and both soul and body will go home to ever be with the Lord. Thanks be to God who giveth us the victory.<br> Sleep on Brother Elbert till
            we meet again on that great and noble resurrection day.<br> To you who loved Brother Elbert, I will say no more can you bring him back to be with you, but by the grace of God, you can go to where he is.<br>

</b></u><br> On August 23, 1927 in the home of Dennis and Dona Little a son was born. This son was named Bernard Little.<br> Bernard was the tenth of thirteen children the Lord blessed Dennis and Dona to love and to cherish. One boy and 2 girls along
            with Dennis and Dona preceded Bernard in death. Three boys and 5 girls remain in this world of trouble to mourn for Bernard. They are Lora Layne, Dema, Kentucky, Gracie Johnson, Paintsville, Kentucky, Adith Morris, Hippo, Kentucky, Elbert
            Little, Wayland, Kentucky, Mamie Sturgill, Wayland, Kentucky, Malcolm Little, Price, Kentucky, Jeanette Mullins, South Point, Ohio, Thomas Crit Little, Lebanon, Ohio. Bernard also leaves to mourn 2 step children, Leah &amp; Ricky of McDowell,
            Kentucky.
            <br> Early in life Bernard met and married Hazel Newman. They were not blessed to have children, but they opened their hearts and their home to a child, Johnny, whom they raised and loved as their own flesh and blood. Hazel was called away
            by death in the year of 1978.<br> A few years later Bernard met and fell in love with Doris Tackett. They were married in October, 1981.<br> The Good Lord blessed this couple to bring forth a little daughter into. this world, Rachel Suzanne.
            Bernard loved his family as only a husband and a father could love. You could see love in his face as he would speak of this little child. I will say to Doris, you are left to raise this little daughter without the aid of your husband. I wish
            to God you would take Jesus in your heart, he can help you through life's rough journey.<br> As one who loved Bernard very much I can tell the world Bernard loved the Baptist church and God's people. I TRULY believe he had a good heart and

</b></u><br> With the help of the good Lord, I will try to write an obituary of my good friend and sister, Katie McKnight.<br> Sister Katie was born December 22, 1922 and departed this life on December 31, 1983, making her stay on earth 61 years and 9
            days. She was born in Waynesburg, Kentucky, the daughter of the late Melvin and Sarah Muncie Caldwell. Her brothers and sisters also precede her in death.<br> On May 11, 1944, she was united in marriage to Arnold McKnight. They were blessed
            with almost 40 wonderful years together. Although they didn't have any children of their own, she loved and mothered all she came in contact with. Her special daughter was Monica Atwood, which she has often told us Was the daughter she never
            had. Katie is survived by her husband, Arnold of Pippa Passes, Kentucky, her foster daughter, Monica Atwood of Elizabeth, Indiana, a host of nieces and nephews and many, many friends. 11<br> In the year 1969 Sister Katie saw the need for a
            Saviour and after feeling she had repented and was a child of God, she attached herself to the Old Regular Baptist Church. In the year 1975, she came by letter to the Hollybush Church and served the Lord and Church faithfully and helped her
            husband in his duties in the leading of the church as our beloved Moderator, until the Lord called her home. I'm sure she will be missed by the church and the whole neighborhood for she was a good christian, a good neighbor and a mother to
            everyone.
            <br> Sister Katie and her good companion has traveled many, many miles to serve the Lord and to help people in need. They have gone out of their way to get people who couldn't drive or had no way to get to church. Sister Katie was gone a lot
            of times from her home, taking people to the doctor and visiting the sick. They not only helped the churches of the New Salem Association but were helping churches in other Associations. I'll say again that she will be missed greatly by all
            that knew her. But she will be missed the most by her dear companion who walked by her side all these years and stayed by her side in the hospital until she was called Home.<br> I'll say to the Hollybush Church that we have lost a good member
            and a faithful worker in the upbuild of the Church. So let's all get behind Brother Arnold and help him in this time of sorrow. We're all his family and he has a place in any of our homes. Although Brother Arnold has a lonesome life ahead
            of him here on Earth, think what joyful reunion he has to look forward to, when he and Sister Katie can walk down streets of gold together and sing praises to the Lord forevermore.<br>

            little white lambs. He said one of the little lambs was Mildred. He said to me, Pearlie I believe you will meet me in heaven. When he got so bad off we had to turn him in a sheet, and he turned his head over to me and said you look so pretty
            and that he loved me. I told him that I loved him too. He told Mommy that he hated to leave her, but that he had to go on. Oh how wonderful it will be to meet in that Bright City where we will never cry or have heart aches any more, or sickness

            Evans, Grethel, Kentucky.<br> Dad and mother had 57 grandchildren, 100 great grandchildren, and 14 great great grandchildren.<br> Dad was a member of the Zion Regular Baptist Church, joining on January 26, 1978. Mother never joined any church,
            but she was a firm believer in God and the Old Regular Baptist Faith. My beloved parents really loved the Old Regular Baptist Church. They let the members of the church build a building, on their land, which was used as a House of Worship
            for more than forty years.<br> Dad and mother were well liked in the community in which they lived and made many friends through their business associates. They had a grocery store for over forty years. Mother worked hard taking care of the
            store and her children at the same time. Mother was very talented doing handcrafts. She gave her ten children, a total of fifty quilts, ten featherbeds, and twenty pillows. Most of the gifts were made by her untiring hands. Each child was
            to receive his/her gift when he/she married.<br> Dad was also gifted and talented. He was skilled in many trades. He was a carpenter, not only building houses, but made many, many coffins for his friends and neighbors. He was also a blacksmith
            for many years. He worked as a miner and timberman. He was commissioned a Kentucky Colonel in 1978.<br> Dad and mother believed in being honest, working hard, being good to their neighbors and friends, and loving God to the fulliest. Their
            home was always open to their friends and loved ones. Motherwas happiest when she was cooking for her church friends. Mother told me a few days before she died, to kill the last chicken on the place to feed the people that came to her funeral.
            Dad lived an extremely lonely life without her. They promised each other, when they were wed, that if one of them should die, the other one would not marry anymore. Dad told me, "When one makes a promise, I say, stick to it."<br> Dad stayed
            with me for more than four years. OH! what precious memories they both left me. Dad and I would sit for hours talking about the hardships of his early life. He said, "I love staying here with you." I tried to provide for his needs in every
            way possible. He was always telling his friends how good my husband, Fred and I were to him. Mother has been dead longer than Dad, but I still miss her as much as I do him. People who still have their parents should truly honor them, because
            they have no idea how lonely one is without them.<br> Judging from the life they lived, I feel that Dad and mother are sleeping, just waiting for the great resurrection morning to claim their reward in Heaven.<br>

            the Lord, because one evening after work Jerry came home and told his father and I that he had seen a vision. He said "Mom and Dad I saw that I was on top of the mountain preaching, and ten thousands of people were coming from all directions
            to listen to me preach". He told us that he prayed to the Lord everyday to watch over him while he was in the mines. He thanked the Lord every time he came back outside safe once again. So goodbye for now my son, someday Mother will join you

Edna often spoke of her great love for her immediate family and also for her natural brothers and sisters as well. She loved all of them and they in return loved and respected
            her very much.<br> Edna also loved the children of God and was very helpful and accommodating to them.<br> During her sickness she often asked the ministers who visited with her to hold prayer. Toward the end of her life she told some of them
            that she too was praying.&nbsp;<br> When we face the dreaded enemy death it brings to our hearts much sorrow. But we must not think of physical death as parting forever. This is not the Christian concept, for the Bible teaches that there shall
            be a glad reunion some day for all those that love the Lord. Our bodies are not made to withstand forever the ravages of this life. A time comes when we must leave this mortal body, "for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal
            must put on immortality" and we have the assurance that when this earthly house falls we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<br> Edna has gone home to be with our God who hears and answers prayer.
            She prayed to be relieved of this body with its pain and to be given a new body that knows no disease nor death-but joy and peace forever!<br>

            church and had tried to be a faithful member, she still felt as if she hadn't been forgiven of her sins and no matter what she did, she couldn't shake this feeling. So while in church one morning, she asked the Lord to show her in some way
            if he had truly forgiven her of her sins. She said "Lord, if you have forgiven me, let the first song that the preacher sings this morning be 'I wonder what they are doing up in heaven today?' As the congregation finished praying, a song rang
            out so loud and true. The first song that was sung was 'I wonder what they are doing up in heaven today?' Nannie never doubted the Lord again for no one else in that room knew what she had prayed.<br> We miss you Mammaw! Its just not the same

            a faithful member as long as he could get there due to being blind. He was a sweet person and bare his afflications so well. I feel he is waiting in the Paradise of Rest for the great day of the Lord. Although Poppie could not see when he
            died, I believe when Christ comes back to get his children he is going to gaze upon Him with two good eyes and see His glory to behold.<br> I believe my Aunt Betty will be rewarded for her many years she cared for Poppie without even complaining.
            All I can say now is children if you want to see your daddy again "Repent and be born again and give your hearts to Jesus". He says "Come unto me, all you that are heavy ladden and I will give you rest". Well I believe Poppie did just that,
            and he gave him rest. I am hoping to see him some sweet day, where there will be no more death or pain. Children and grandchildren prepare to meet Him some sweet day.<br>

            hands. He said God can keep us or take us away. When it was time for me to leave he asked me to come back soon and see him. He said I have some good things to talk about. God chose to take him before I could go back. I feel from all he told
            me that day, he only went to sleep in the arms of Jesus. I feel He only added another rose to His garden because I feel he believed in God.<br> Show your love for your parents while they are still with you. Sew your flowers while they can
            see them. When death takes one of them, it's too late. I miss my Dad. We shared so many things. We has so many talks in his old barn where he had his little work shop. I know my Dad is at rest because God doesn't turn down a sincere praying
            heart.

            of Jackson, Ohio along with one son, David, still at home.<br> Sister Pauline started her journey through life September 23, 1935 in Elliott County, Kentucky and departed February 15, 1984, making her stay here on earth 48 years, 4 months
            and 12 days. Though her life was relatively short, its' quality was truly 100 fold. I have never seen a person bare her afflictions more patiently, always seeking to please the Lord even in the valley and shadow of death. God blessed her to
            seek Him and she surely found a friend in Jesus. She joined the Little Ettie Church of Old Regular Baptist and was baptized the 2nd Sunday in August, 1972. She was truly a Christian who bore the fruits and her life was a inspiration to all
            of us. So often, even as she grew weak and feeble would she lift her hands and shout, glorifing her Heavenly Father. A more faithful sister to labor and feed so many brothers, sisters and friends I have never known. After several operations
            and hard journeys to Columbus to have her blood dialysis after her kidneys failed. Anytime you entered her home or hospital room you always left feeling good because the conversation was Godly. Finally, after a long battle with cancer the
            Lord said My child you have suffered enough come home. She peacefully and gently fell asleep in the arms of a blessed redeemer. Her voice is silent now though often in our minds we can still hear her shout. Our sister is resting under His
            throne and her earthly tabernacle returns to dust on the hill back of the place she loved so well, the Little Ettie Church. Always keep this in mind, there is a great trumpet yet to sound and that tabernacle shall never fade away for it is
            eternal in Heaven.<br> To her faithful and loving husband and brother in Christ, Brother Lloyd, she has left the hope of meeting you again. To her sons she has left a bright shining light for each of you to follow always admonishing you that
            you must be born again. May God bless you boys to seek after the Lord for you know how she always taught you.<br>

            <br> Marie D. Stumbo was born August 6, 1916, at Jacks Creek, Kentucky and passed from this earthly life on November 26, 1983. She was the daughter of Seland Cook and Lizzie Sweny Cook. She was married to the late John Milton Stumbo on June
            1, 1935. To this union no children were born but they raised Edith Cook and Patricia Martin as their very own. Marie not only lost her husband, father and mother, but a brother Ralph and sisters Ethel and Edith preceded her in death. She is
            survived by one brother, Sherman Cook of McDowell and her foster daughter Edith Martin Skeens and foster granddaughter Patricia Martin of Prestonsburg, Kentucky.<br> Early in life Marie chose teaching school as a profession after having graduated
            from Pikeville College with a B.S. Degree. She held a Masters Degree from Morehead State University and had twelve hours on her Rank 1. She taught at the McDowell School for thirty-five years and was known by her peers as one of the best and
            most dedicated teachers. Many students went through her classes in the seventh and eighth grades where they were well grounded in the basics and went on through high school and completed college and who owe much of their success to this fine,
            dedicated teacher who believed in a good fundamental education for her pupils. In her later teaching career she taught remedial reading and continued to add her special touch in helping children. The true measure of this good, hard working
            teacher will never be fully known.<br> She belonged to many professional organizations such as the Kentucky Education Association, the Nattional Teachers Association, the Jenny Wiley Reading Council and the Kentucky Retired Teachers Association.
            She was also a charter member of the Drift Woman's Club.<br> The greatest thing Marie did in life was receiving Jesus Christ as her Saviour and Lord and devoting her life to HIS cause. She professed a Hope in Christ and was baptized upon her
            profession of Faith by Elders Mitchell Chaffins and Woodrow Pack in 1975 and took her membership at the Old Beaver Church. She was a devoted and a faithful member until death. Just as she was such a good teacher so was she a good Christian.
            Many times when the good Spirit overshadowed her she could be heard shouting the praises to her King. She has suffered much, but now she has found blessed relief and God has taken her to Himself. While it is a time of sorrow for those who
            loved her, it is a wonderful day for her. So let us today rejoice with her, for she is a thousand times better off than any of us who must stay a little longer in this old world. With Christ's peace in our hearts and Christ's hope in our souls,
            we say good-by for now and we shall continue to hope to meet her again one day in the sunshine of His love where we will have perfect peace, happiness and joy forever. Marie has gone on to her Eternal Home but the influence of her earthly
            life will live on and on and on The following is a poem of her own writing with the wish that it be added to her obituary:</font>

            <br> With the help of the good Lord, I will try and write an obituary of my beloved husband, Orbin Moore. He was born June 4, 1901 and passed away May 8, 1984. He leaves behind to mourn his lost, three children, four step-children, fifteen
            grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and so many friends that knew him. Three children preceded him in death. Orbin and I were married for nineteen years. I had almost given up hope of ever hearing him praying, but the last time I talked
            to him at the hospital I could see a big change in him for the day he had to go to surgery he told Brother Jimmy Hall that he had to go to surgery but the Lord was going in there with him and I heard him pray to the Lord to save his soul and
            with them sweet words there is no doubt in my mind that he's gone to rest where there will be no more pain. He always believed in the Baptist Church and he loved pretty singing. He had a smile for all that knew him and his door was always
            open to everyone and he always wanted them to stay and eat with him. He will be missed by all but none will miss him like I will. I could go on and on and say many good things about Orbin but the best part of all is that I say just sleep on,
            for with the help of the Lord I believe I will meet him in Heaven when this life is over. Why do I say this? Because of what he told me when he was in the hospital at McDowell. He said if he lived to get back home that he would go to church
            with me but he said if he didn't get back home just go on in the good old hearted way. .<br>

            him. Her health has deteriorated for the last few years. She fell and broke her hip in 1974, but improved and was able to go to church and do things for herself, but 15 months ago she fell and broke the other hip making her bedfast and unable
            to care for herself. Her children and grandchildren waited on her day and night, giving her the best of care. We want to thank all of those who came in and helped us in so many ways. We shall never forget your kindness.<br> Us children have
            lost a most kind and loving mother. She was so good to us and was so good and kind to everyone. Now God has saw fit to call her home to be at rest with Dad and her two sons.<br> Mother leaves to mourn her passing, her 7 children, 41 grandchildren,

            granddaughter. For many, many weeks, Jane and her children, spent hours at mother's bedside. They have given her the best of loving care. Without Jane we don't know what we would have done. Donita and Phillip became Mother's children and were
            a great source of comfort to her. There's no doubt in my mind these children loved her.<br> We also appreciate the help and care that all the grandchildren gave her, and we want to thank all who helped, for their love, kindness, and for the
            food that they prepared for us.<br> May I say to Mother's family let us all try to love each other. Do as Dad and Mother would want us to. We have had wonderful parents and may we never forget the life they lived.<br>

            has lost a wonderful brother. It's not only sad for his natural family, but it's sad for the church, who loved him so much. Even though we hated to lose him, there's one thing for sure, God does all things well. He never makes a mistake. Brother
            Russell would tell you God was good to him in all things.<br> No doubt God extended his life for 5 years from his first heart attack, he got well enough to come back to church, we thank God for that. Oh what joy and peace it must have been
            when he feel asleep in the arms of our Lord! I feel he has made a wonderful exchange.,<br> So many good things could be said about Brother Russell. He always had an humble voice, he set a good example for the young brothers to follow, he left
            his footprints in the sand as many Pilgrims that walked this way.<br> All the pain and suffering that he did, I never once heard him complain but stated plainly he was seeking a better country.<br> Now he has laid his cross down, he will suffer
            no more, but will receive a glorious crown. So sleep on Brother Russell, take your rest, I don't think you will sleep long. I feel Jesus is coming soon. We will meet again in that great reunion. My prayer is that God will help us to keep the
            Faith and order and live in peace with one another.<br> May God bless you children and Sister Ettie to accept this great loss.<br>

            <br> Dad, words cannot express how much we love you. You were such a loving caring Dad. You knew we loved you but somehow it seemed we couldn't tell you enough. There will be a great void in our lives without you but we know our loss is Heaven's
            gain. Dad we know what we have to do to meet you in your new home for you taught us the very best way a father could so Dad sleep on until we meet you again.<br>

            for 35 years, although she didn't get to fill her seat as others did, she always loved the Lord and put her faith and trust in him. The Lord reached down his hand on Sunday, October 23, 1983, and picked a beautiful flower, that he needed for
            his garden.<br> I feel that Granny is resting with Jesus and she is not suffering anymore. Granny's home is so sad and lonely since God called her away. Her children miss her so much. We all miss her sweet little smile, her loving eye's and
            those tiny little hands that touched our face's so very gently.<br> God blessed us with a wonderful mother, grandmother and great grandmother. She always wanted her children close beside her. Thanks be to God he granted us the one blessing
            of being able to be by her side when she passed from this world. We'll always love you Granny and we miss you so much, but by the Grace of God, we'll all meet you again some sweet day. You were my rose Granny. A wonderful rose of my life and
            I miss you so. But Granny you left us with such beautiful memories, such precious memories that we'll always treasure.<br>

            75 years, 6 months and 19 days.<br> In the year of 1925 she met and married Bill Hall and to this union were born 12 children, five sons and seven daughters, two sons preceded her in death, Estill and Cleveland, leaving to mourn her loss her
            husband Bill, seven daughters, Estie Williams, Ruth Belford, Jean Seiter, and Ethel Kincaid all of Marion, Ohio, Mona Lisa Knight of Alexandria, Virginia, Joan Welch of Murray, Utah, Mary Ann Rames of Ashland, Kentucky, three sons of Marion,

            all preceded her in death.<br> Mom joined the Old Regular Baptist Rebecca Church on August 12th, 1952 at Hall, Kentucky and was baptized by Elder Eppie Holbrook. Mom was a faithful member to fill her seat in church until she moved to Marion,
            Ohio and then wasn't able to go back as often as she wanted to, but went to church here in Ohio as long as she was able to go. She loved the old time ways and would shout all over the church house. The last few years of her life Mom became
            very sick but she bore her pain and suffered well, for she had hopes of a better home when she left this old troubled world. While she was in the hospital a few days before she passed away, we had a real conversation together and she said
            in case she slipped away from us children she wanted us not worry over her for she had a better home to go to. I told her we wouldn't worry over where she was going to for we believe she was going home where she would live forever, but we
            would miss her so much. She also told all of her children at the hospital on a day when she was feeling real bad that those ones that weren't ready to go home with Jesus for them to get ready and come Home to Heaven where she was going to.
            So we all believe with all our hearts that Mom has gone home to heaven where she will never suffer anymore, I thank God that Mom had such a good talk with us telling where she was going. We love and miss her very much but we know that God
            loved her more.<br>

            months and 30 days. He was born in Halo, Kentucky to Perry and Lina Johnson Isaac.<br> In the year of 1951, he met and married Alberta Hall and to this union were born three children, one son: James Arthur serving in the U.S. Navy two daughters:
            Ann Griffith and Bonnie Wilson of Springfield, Ohio. He also leaves six grandchildren. Besides his dad Perry of McDermott, Ohio he leaves ten brothers and sisters, they are: Sylvester of Wakeman, Ohio, Hearlie of Peebles, Ohio, Allen and Nannie
            Ewing of McDermott, Ohio, Hiram of Xenia, Ohio, Franklin of Springfield, Ohio, Anna Howard of Hebron, Ohio, Gloria Korns of Newark, Ohio, and Virginia Horsley of Otway, Ohio. He also leaves a great host of brothers and sisters in the church.
            He was preceded in death by his mother, Lina, a brother Albert and two infant sisters.<br> Dad joined the Old Regular Baptist Church at Little Children's Home in Laurel, Indiana. He was baptized the 3rd Sunday of September in 1974 by Elders
            Zee Holbrook, Bufford Brock and Roy Caudill. They baptized him in a chair and all three of them held him. Dad had gotten hurt on the job July 29 of that year and we almost lost him three times. With God's mercy he got another chance to change
            his ways and save his soul and that he did. He told God if he would let him live a little longer he would change. Dad always went to church every weekend. Even at his worse times he would find someone to drive him. In the last few years he
            had gotten to the point that he couldn't drive at all. He had such a friend in Elder Zee Holbrook and would go to church with him alot. I think Dad felt that his time was coming because the night before he died he wanted to go visiting everyone
            even after he had been sick all day. Dad tried to hide his illness from most people and a lot of people just didn't believe the way he acted. He tried to laugh and keep a smile on his face all the time. Later after he was baptized he moved
            his letter the Little Bethel Church in Sligo, Ohio. He loved that church and always felt at home there. He was always talking of ways to help the church. I know that along with his family that his family in the church miss him too. Sleep on
            Daddy, we hope to see you someday.<br>

            <br> He was so special to us, I know his suffering is over. My mind goes back to the many hospital stays, surgeries, his confinements to bed, the intensive care units and all the times he was on the critical lists. I wish I could have taken

            his prayers live on.<br> Now, Lord, Emit fulfilled the role you sent him here to do, the job ofa son, husband, father, grandfather, brother and your child.<br> Now Lord, bind our hearts together with your love. Let us live in the shadow of
            Emit's love and meet him. Lord, help us through this separation until we meet all our loved ones.<br> We thank you Lord for Emit to love. We give you the thanks for sharing Emit with us and knowing we shall meet him if we have learned from
            him what he learned from you-You are the life, the way.<br> Amos 4:13 says: For, Lo, He that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high
            places of the earth, the Lord, the God of Host, is his name.<br> May we be ready to meet you as Emit said he was ready to go when you were ready to take him home. Your word tells us, "Wait on the Lord: Be of good courage, and he will strengthen
            thine heart: Wait, I say, on the Lord." Psalms 27:14.<br> Forgive us Lord, for weeping, but unite our hearts so that we can live in Emit's memory. Now he is with you, may we not lose sight of that, but be ready as Emit was ready. His many
            expressions of love and kindnesses will be with us until we meet again.<br> Dear Lord, may his separation from us make us strong in the things he stood for, and just keep in mind that where he now is we too will be someday, by the same path
            he had chosen. We are grieving, and the pain is so real.<br>

            born two children: Margaret Hope Ray Green and Noah D., Jr. Junior preceded his mother in death February 8, 1977. She also had two grandchildren: Nancy Lea Green Bias and Tony Ray, three great-grandchildren: Caroline Hope Bias, Tony, Jr. and

            Lexington, Kentucky, Stanford Tackett, Virgie, Kentucky.<br> Hettie had spent the last few years in the Mountain Manor Nursing Home where she loved all the staff working there and kept them entertained with her lovely singing. No matter how
            bad she felt, she was always willing to sing for anyone who asked and her lovely voice always stayed strong and melodious. She joined the Enterprise Church about 50 years ago and remained a faithful member until her death.<br> Hettie had a
            hard life in this world, but when Jesus gives her the keys to the mansion prepared for her and her long white robe, her lovely voice will be tuned to sing in the heavenly choir and all her toils and sorrows will be over.<br>

</u></b><br> With many sweet memories and a lonely and sad heart, I'll try to write the obituary of our dad and loving husband.<br> Dad was born on September 29, 1912 to Roach and Anna Sparkman of Hueysville, Kentucky, making his stay here on earth 71
            years. Dad was married to mom, Julia Bentley on March 28, 1931. Born unto them were three children. They were Gladys Compton of Shiloh, Ruby Tackett of Shiloh and Dalphene Spencer of Morehead, Kentucky. Surviving are three brothers. They are
            Willie and Johnny Sparkman of Hueysville, Kentucky and Homer Sparkman of Willard, Ohio. There are eleven grandchildren and fourteen great grandchildren who miss him very much.<br> Dad gave his heart to God 51 years ago and was baptized into
            the Old Regular Baptist Church. Dad has been a light to his children in the world. He went to church as long as he was able. After he could no longer walk and go to church, he loved for the brothers and sisters to come to his house have meetings.
            I know it helped on his journey.<br> The death angel came the 14th of October in 1983, leaving our home so lonely and sad. I believe Dad fell asleep in the arms of Jesus. Dad couldn't speak to us before he left us. There was much sadness and
            sometimes joy in his loving face. We know Dad hated to leave us in this sinful world. We love and miss Dad very much, but, God loved him more. God needed another rose for his Garden.<br> I believe Dad could see into Glory Land just before
            he went to sleep. As my sister, Ruby, stood beside his bed, he pointed his finger out the window. He was trying to show her something that natural eyes cannot see. She said his eyes sparkled and were so bright, no doubt what he saw was beautiful.
            Oh, how I longed to see what Dad had seen.<br> I know Mom misses Dad very much. She's like the little dove mourning because she has lost her mate. I hope and pray, if it's the Lord's Will, that he'll leave Mom with us awhile to fill in the
            sadness and the emptiness since Dad has gone.<br> Dad labored hard in the coal mines to raise his children. But, now his laboring and suffering is over. When he became sick and unable, he didn't complain. He took it like a soldier.<br> He's
            much more than a dad or grandfather. He was a friend who was always there when we needed him. He left us so many good memories to keep us all going on. He had the patience of Job and wisdom of the Bible that God had given him throughout the
            years. His place at the table is empty now, but I'm sure he's feasting on God's Glory.<br> All the atomic bombs cannot wake Dad. But when Gabriel blows his trumpet, Dad will awaken and go home with that blood washed band. I have hopes of seeing
            Daddy again and I believe, I'll know him on that bright and heavenly shore. Sleep on Dad, take your peaceful sleep. I know It's what you were longing for.<br> Oh my children and loving sisters, if you want to see Daddy again, get your ticket
            while there is still time, for time is running out.<br> The entire family would like to express thanks and appreciation to all the friends and brothers and sisters of the church who helped ease the pain.<br>

            <br> It is with deep grief that I attempt to write this obituary of our precious son and husband of Jackie, James Monroe Vanderpool, who was born May 26, 1951 and deceased this life March 5, 1984, who was the son of Monroe Vanderpool and Mary
            Smith Vanderpool of Hippo, Kentucky, both parents and his companion survive.<br> In all my dozens of years in writing, this is the most difficult task that I have faced.<br> January 1, 1982 James was united in marriage to Jacqueline Wireman
            of Waldo, Magoffin County, Kentucky, the daughter of Arnold and Fairley Wireman. No children were born unto this union. Elder Jimmie Hall performed the marriage ceremony.<br> James was born at Hippo, Kentucky and lived in this community all
            of his 32 years of life. It seemed that everyone that he came in contact was a friend as his cheerful personality seemed to reach their heart. Before his marriage he built his home with the help of his companion, Jackie. He was a boy that
            wanted to work and make his own way in this life. He did not want to put a hardship on any person.<br> His death came as an accident while working at a Coal Tipple on Caney Fork of Middle Creek, he being a Foreman of the Company of Nerco Hiller
            Coal Company.<br> Surviving brothers are: Fred, Clyde, and Carl Ray of Hippo, Kentucky and Lowell of Willard, Ohio.<br> One sister survives: Jewell Vanderpool Cook of East Bernstadt, Kentucky.<br> One grandmother survives: I lant Smith of
            Gunlock, Kentucky.<br> Surviving relatives and friends are so numerous that I could not begin to estimate the number. Probably everyone that he came in contact with was a friend to him, as he always had a smile and something to say seemed
            like to cheer them along their way. As I look at all of the wall of the church house covered with beautiful flowers, then I know how he was loved.<br> James did not belong to any church. He did notice the walks of Christian people and respected
            them. Oftimes in my council to him he would say "Dad you do not have to tell me that because I know about the Life which you have lived before me." His mother-in-law said that he had made remarks that he would like to be like his Daddy.<br>            James had been carrying a tiny Bible in his billfold for years, which was faded and worn with date 1975 dated in the back. This brought back memories of a little testament which I carried through the Battlefields of Europe during World War
            II. James companion requested that this bible which he was carrying be buried with him.<br> Now a precious loved one is gone. An emptiness is in my soul that only God can help. We do hope that James, before his soul left this earth that he
            touched the garment of Jesus. His companion said that he had asked her in the mornings if she ever thanked God that he had let her live through the nights. He told her that he did. God only knows the Destination of a person when they leave
            this earth. The judgment which God will give to all persons will be right.<br> As the song we sing "Oh, if I had some secret place that I might hide from sorrow", I do feel and believe with all my heart that I have that with my God.<br> My
            companion and myself have been serving God for many years. I know not who belongs to God, but if James' brothers and sister, companion, relatives and friends have not made peace with God, I do hope they will consider their ways while life
            and opportunity affords them the privilege. We know death is coming to us, but know not when.<br> In my farewell words, I pray that the good Lord will look down upon my afflicted companion and little Jackie (James loved her so dearly) and
            strengthen them. I hope our family can grow closer, and I hope I can dedicate my life more fully in serving my God. I am not an old man, but I know that I am nearing my Life's end, and oh how I wish all my relatives and natural friends would
            meet with all of God's people in Heaven where pain, grief and sorrow will be no more.<br> Great consollation has been given me since I have written the foregoing, Charlotte, the bookkeeper of the Company where James worked said he had told
            her in talking to her that if he was killed that the Lord's arms were open for him.<br>

            own special way.<br> He entered this world on October 12, 1928 in the home of his parents, Allen Wince and Myrtle Boyd Akers as the fourth of seven surviving children. In the mountains that surround us now, Dad spent many a happy day with
            Ervin, Evan, Daniel, Lazelle, Ray and Juanita. He left these hills of Kentucky with a homesick heart to find work in Ohio.<br> Dad was a builder by trade and a builder by heart-molding his world around his sweet loving wife of 36 years, Helene
            Conn Akers. Their foundation was laid on June 7, 1947 in Lancer, Kentucky. Unto this union was brought the first building stone, Sherry Helen, the next Sandra Kay, and the family home was completed with their baby girl Sheila, in Vermilion.<br>            Dad always put us first, letting us live our own lives, choose our own paths, and guiding the paths we chose.

            <br> It is for the love and concern of a dear old sainted sister, that I will try to write an obituary of my dear sister Lura Hamilton. The daughter of the late Joe and Sally Ann Hughes of the Mousie, Kentucky area.<br> She was born September
            27, 1902 and departed this life April 12, 1983 at the Methodist Hospital of Pikeville, Kentucky. After spending some days in serious condition suffering from a stroke.<br> At the age of approximately 22, she was married to Dewey Gibson of
            Right Beaver, Kentucky. And to this union was born 1 daughter, Sylvia. She and her first husband were divorced. Then she married, Jake Hamilton of Allen, Kentucky and to this union were no children born. But Jake cherished Sylvia as his own
            child.
            <br> In the year of May 8, 1966, Sister Lura was converted and gave her hand to become a member of The Regular Baptist Church, and took her membership at The New Salem Church at Harold, Kentucky and was a very faithful member until death.
            She is survived by her daughter Sylvia and son in law, Russell Wilson of Wawaka, Indiana, and her 4 grandchildren, 9 great grandchildren, her relatives, friends, brothers and sisters of the church and neighbors to mourn her passing.<br> I
            have had so many wonderful conversations with her concerning her hard trials of life. And her joy in her's and our precious redeemer, King Jesus. She lived a lonely life by herself after Jake died. She said brother Edd I know I can go live
            with Sylvia in Indiana, and she wanted me to. But I am an independent person.<br> Sylvia and Russell and grandchildren, I know you loved her so very much and she talked of her love for you all. And you stood by her side to answer her ever
            call in her time of sickness in the hospital. But no doubt she is much better off than we are. She has ceased from her labor and went on to rest in peace until as said by Job 14 chapter: 12-15 verses. These scriptures are very much cherished
            by the children of the Kingdom. Having the living Hope in their souls bring to their attention the wonderful consolation of laying down in the grave in peaceful rest in the name of The King of Glory until the wrath of the Great Soverign God
            of all Eternity has passed. And the Heavens be no more. And that he has appointed a time to call them, his believers, the children of the Kingdom, from the power of the grave, give them the new (Spiritual) body, meet them in the air, and convey
            them to Glory to appear in the present of The Father of eternal ages.<br> Bless Christ when our minds is clear of pain, misery, sorrow, and tribulations of this present world and we can thank or he causes us to meditate on him and his righteousness,
            it is then we can say as the old writer did., His joy, kindness, and love is altogether to good for wretched me.<br> So my final words in this obituary is sleep on dear pilgrim sister. May God Bless your little family, keep them, guide them,

            10 years to the day before his death. He was baptized at the Old Regular Baptist Church in Pikeville, Kentucky on May 25, 1974. He loved to go to church as long as he was able to go. His eyes had gotten so bad in the last few years, he could
            no longer read his Bible. Even though he could no longer read the Bible, he was able to listen to tapes of the Old and New Testament, which he enjoyed so much.<br> Dad's last week with us were the saddest days of our lives. It was so hard
            to see him lay there so helpless, but we are all thankful we could be by his side those last days and do what we could to make him comfortable.<br> We would like to thank all the friends, relatives and the members of the Little Ida, and Pikeville
            Baptist Church, who were so kind and thoughtful. In addition, we would like to especially thank Whipple Reynolds. There was no man our father respected more. Dad's resting place is in Johnson Memorial Cemetary, Pikeville, Kentucky.<br>
