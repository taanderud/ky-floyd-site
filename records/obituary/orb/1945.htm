Rice. He was born Feb. 18, 1851, died Oct. 6, 1944, aged 93 years, seven months

and 24 days. He was married to Sarah Sturgill in 1874. To this union were born

five children; three preceded him in death, which left Bro. Sam and Lonzo to

mourn their loss. He joined the United Baptist Church and was baptized by Bro.

Sam, his son, when he was 75 years old, on the second Saturday in July, 1925. He

lived faithful and always filled his seat at church and went to church when he

had to be hauled in a sled. We miss him at the old church and his home. He was

loved by his many friends and relatives. He believed in the doctrine of

salvation by grace. We trust that his grandchildren will strive to meet him in

the city of the blessed. &nbsp;<o:p>

is with a sad heart that I try to write the obituary of one that was so dear,

to-wit: my husband, Thomas B. Scalf, who was born March 10, 1894, and died Oct.

2, 1944; was married Dec. 25, 1917 and to this union was born one daughter,

Evelyn, and on Nov. 22, 1919 he was injured in the mines which left him a

cripple for the rest of his life which was 25 years and 10 days. On Easter

Sunday 1920 he was carried to the water in a sheet and was buried in baptism in

which he had lived a faithful Christian life until God saw fit to call his dear,

broken body home where he will never suffer any more, which I had to see him do

so much. He has gone to that mansion he has read and talked to me so much about.

He is not only missed at home but I believe all his brothers and sisters in the

church miss him. He was a deacon and clerk of New Life Church where he was a

member, also the treasurer. So many times when he would not be able to go to the

churchhouse his good brothers would come to our little home and have the

meeting. He always loved to feed the church people. He would always say,

&quot;Lilly, fix the best we have got, that's all we have got to live for.&quot;

He would say, &quot;We have not got much of this world's goods, but I do know we

have got friends, and for that I am thankful.&quot; He is not dead but only

sleeping, waiting for the sweet resurrection when he will come forth with a

perfect body likened to Christ's own body, then he won't need a wheel-chair or

have to be cared for like a baby. He told me before he died that he would not

get well. He said, &quot;Looks like I have been at death's door so many times

but God has been good to me and let me stay all these many years, but this time

I will have to go,&quot; and he told me who he wanted to preach his funeral and

said, &quot;When I am gone I want you to go to all the good meetings, you have

missed so much on my account and I want to say to Evelyn and George, if you ever

see your daddy again you will have to be born again and follow in his

footsteps.&quot; I have heard him pray so much for you both. As I sit on my

porch I can see the little mound where he is sleeping, waiting, the redemption

of his body that won't be a cripple, as I have heard him sing, He will heal the

crippled and give sight to the blind and teach our children how to walk. He will

raise up the dead that is sleeping underground and send them home to God.&nbsp;<o:p>

the second Saturday, 1913 and was ordained to preach October second Saturday,

1916. He was always faithful to the charge. He went night and day when called

on. He had the care of three churches when he had to leave us. The time I talked

to the rest of his children, if you see your father again you will have to take

your father's advice. You don't know how many times I have heard Brother Sam

pray for you. Brother Sam isn't dead but just sleeping till God will wake the

dead. I don't have any doubts about him because he bore the fruits and the Bible

says by their fruits you shall know them. Sister Cretie and children, don't

weep. When this short life is over we shall meet Brother Sam again. It is with

girls and four boys. One preceded her in death. Father departed this life in

1931. Mother joined the Regular Baptist Church in 1901. She was a faithful

member and was loved by all who knew her. In 1904 she was taken into the United

Baptist Church on recommendation on account of bemg more convenient for her to

attend church. She said she could see no difference in their doctrine. Mother

always liked to attend church. Mother being afflicted for several years before

she died she didn't attend church as often as she wished. She moved to Ohio in

1925. She still held her fellowship at Clear Creek Church, Fed, Ky. I am

afflicted and could not be with mother during her last days on earth. When she

passed away they brought her to my house and kept her with me three nights. Her

funeral was preached here at my house by Charley Holbrook and Torn Smith. Oh,

how I miss mother coming to see me. She always looked back at me as she went out

the door. She always told us children not to grieve after her. All she hated to

die for, she hated to leave her children. I feel she is resting in heaven where

there is no pain nor sorrow. I am trusting in God I will meet her in heaven. She

would always counsel us children to do the right thing. There are many good

things I could say about mother. As this obituary is getting too long I will

close.&nbsp;<o:p>

request I will attempt to write a short sketch of the life of my dear, loving

brother, Will Conn, who has gone to live with Jesus. He told me there was

nothing in his way. He was born March 19, 1869 and departed this life Oct. 21,

1944. He was 75 years, seven months and two days old. He was a son of Sill Conn

and Charity Conn and was married to Martha Taylor Nov. 28, 1894. To this union

were born seven children, six boys and one daughter. One preceded him in

infancy, leaving his good companion six children, three brothers and one sister

and a host of grandchildren and friends to mourn his loss. Bro. Will joined :the

old United Baptist Church about the year 1914 and always filled his seat until

physically unable. For several years he was unable to attend his meetings, at

last the dreadful disease seized him so severe. His loved ones gathered around

his bed to minister to his needs, His dear old heart-broken companion, who stood

over him day and night, was ready every call to soothe his pain. Oh, how sad

when I saw her lay her hand upon his dying brow and said, I have done all I can.

I knew he must soon answer the great summons from on high, where the bright,

dazzling light will never fade away that I saw shining on the foot of his bed in

his departing moments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is missed

by all his friends and neighbors, he was always so kind to everybody, and always

delighted to have someone come to his home and talk to him on the Bible and

about his home over yonder. He never let any one leave his home hungry near meal

time. Brother was very patient during his suffering and called for his preaching

brethren to come to his home and have meeting for him a 'short time before he

passed away. Oh, the old home is so lonesome to me when I go there and his dear

old companion is so lonesome. I often see the tears trickling down her face and

I heard her say she wished her departure of this life would come soon. I feel in

the sweet by and by I will see Brother Will again in a land of everlasting joy,

where brother will not be worrying about his dear boy in the army. He watched

the door so patiently for him to come just before he passed away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Children, I will now say to you, he is watching a greater door now for

you to come, and if you ever see father again you must be born again, not of a

corruptible seed but incorruptible. I believe brother is resting in the paradise

of God with his father and mother and the rest of the family, awaiting the great

trumpet to sound that awakes the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>sleeping

dust, when Jesus comes in the cloud of glory to gather His elect home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Oh, what a happy meeting there will be when we take our flight on wings

of love to meet Jesus in the air when the song starts that never ends, and to

hear the voice of Jesus, &quot;Fly open wide we everlasting gates and let my

bride come in.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun:
