He was born Feb. 18, 1851, died Oct. 6, 1944, aged 93 years, seven months and 24 days. He was married to Sarah Sturgill in 1874. To this union were born five children; three
        preceded him in death, which left Bro. Sam and Lonzo to mourn their loss. He joined the United Baptist Church and was baptized by Bro. Sam, his son, when he was 75 years old, on the second Saturday in July, 1925. He lived faithful and always filled
        his seat at church and went to church when he had to be hauled in a sled. We miss him at the old church and his home. He was loved by his many friends and relatives. He believed in the doctrine of salvation by grace. We trust that his grandchildren
        will strive to meet him in the city of the blessed. &nbsp;

        on Nov. 22, 1919 he was injured in the mines which left him a cripple for the rest of his life which was 25 years and 10 days. On Easter Sunday 1920 he was carried to the water in a sheet and was buried in baptism in which he had lived a faithful
        Christian life until God saw fit to call his dear, broken body home where he will never suffer any more, which I had to see him do so much. He has gone to that mansion he has read and talked to me so much about. He is not only missed at home but
        I believe all his brothers and sisters in the church miss him. He was a deacon and clerk of New Life Church where he was a member, also the treasurer. So many times when he would not be able to go to the churchhouse his good brothers would come
        to our little home and have the meeting. He always loved to feed the church people. He would always say, &quot;Lilly, fix the best we have got, that's all we have got to live for.&quot; He would say, &quot;We have not got much of this world's
        goods, but I do know we have got friends, and for that I am thankful.&quot; He is not dead but only sleeping, waiting for the sweet resurrection when he will come forth with a perfect body likened to Christ's own body, then he won't need a wheel-chair
        or have to be cared for like a baby. He told me before he died that he would not get well. He said, &quot;Looks like I have been at death's door so many times but God has been good to me and let me stay all these many years, but this time I will
        have to go,&quot; and he told me who he wanted to preach his funeral and said, &quot;When I am gone I want you to go to all the good meetings, you have missed so much on my account and I want to say to Evelyn and George, if you ever see your daddy
        again you will have to be born again and follow in his footsteps.&quot; I have heard him pray so much for you both. As I sit on my porch I can see the little mound where he is sleeping, waiting, the redemption of his body that won't be a cripple,
        as I have heard him sing, He will heal the crippled and give sight to the blind and teach our children how to walk. He will raise up the dead that is sleeping underground and send them home to God.&nbsp;

        and four boys. One preceded her in death. Father departed this life in 1931. Mother joined the Regular Baptist Church in 1901. She was a faithful member and was loved by all who knew her. In 1904 she was taken into the United Baptist Church on
        recommendation on account of bemg more convenient for her to attend church. She said she could see no difference in their doctrine. Mother always liked to attend church. Mother being afflicted for several years before she died she didn't attend
        church as often as she wished. She moved to Ohio in 1925. She still held her fellowship at Clear Creek Church, Fed, Ky. I am afflicted and could not be with mother during her last days on earth. When she passed away they brought her to my house
        and kept her with me three nights. Her funeral was preached here at my house by Charley Holbrook and Torn Smith. Oh, how I miss mother coming to see me. She always looked back at me as she went out the door. She always told us children not to
        grieve after her. All she hated to die for, she hated to leave her children. I feel she is resting in heaven where there is no pain nor sorrow. I am trusting in God I will meet her in heaven. She would always counsel us children to do the right
        thing. There are many good things I could say about mother. As this obituary is getting too long I will close.&nbsp;

mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">By request I will attempt to write a short sketch of the life of my dear, loving brother, Will Conn, who has gone to live with Jesus. He told me there was nothing in his way. He was born March 19, 1869 and departed this life Oct. 21, 1944. He was
        75 years, seven months and two days old. He was a son of Sill Conn and Charity Conn and was married to Martha Taylor Nov. 28, 1894. To this union were born seven children, six boys and one daughter. One preceded him in infancy, leaving his good
        companion six children, three brothers and one sister and a host of grandchildren and friends to mourn his loss. Bro. Will joined :the old United Baptist Church about the year 1914 and always filled his seat until physically unable. For several
        years he was unable to attend his meetings, at last the dreadful disease seized him so severe. His loved ones gathered around his bed to minister to his needs, His dear old heart-broken companion, who stood over him day and night, was ready every
        call to soothe his pain. Oh, how sad when I saw her lay her hand upon his dying brow and said, I have done all I can. I knew he must soon answer the great summons from on high, where the bright, dazzling light will never fade away that I saw shining
        on the foot of his bed in his departing moments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is missed by all his friends and neighbors, he was always so kind to everybody, and always delighted to have someone come to his home and talk to
        him on the Bible and about his home over yonder. He never let any one leave his home hungry near meal time. Brother was very patient during his suffering and called for his preaching brethren to come to his home and have meeting for him a 'short
        time before he passed away. Oh, the old home is so lonesome to me when I go there and his dear old companion is so lonesome. I often see the tears trickling down her face and I heard her say she wished her departure of this life would come soon.
        I feel in the sweet by and by I will see Brother Will again in a land of everlasting joy, where brother will not be worrying about his dear boy in the army. He watched the door so patiently for him to come just before he passed away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Children, I will now say to you, he is watching a greater door now for you to come, and if you ever see father again you must be born again, not of a corruptible seed but incorruptible. I believe brother is resting in the paradise of God with his
        father and mother and the rest of the family, awaiting the great trumpet to sound that awakes the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>sleeping dust, when Jesus comes in the cloud of glory to gather His elect home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Oh, what a happy meeting there will be when we take our flight on wings of love to meet Jesus in the air when the song starts that never ends, and to hear the voice of Jesus, &quot;Fly open wide we everlasting gates and let my bride come in.&quot;
        <span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">&nbsp; </span>I will say again to the children, if you want to be one in that number and expect to see father again, you must fall out with sin and join with the free of fered mercies of God before it is finally and. everlastingly too late.&nbsp;
