<p><strong>ELMER CLYDE AND ESTER REE TACKETT <a href="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1992/elmer_ester_tackett.jpg"><img src="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1992/elmer_ester_tackett_small.jpg" alt="elmer_ester_tackett.jpg (15311 bytes)" width="52" height="67"></a></strong> There just aren't enough words or space to express the sadness in our lives, since Mom and Dad passed away. With broken hearts but loving memories, we will do our best to write an obituary of our most beloved parents, Elmer Clyde and Ester Ree Tackett. Both were born in Pike County, Kentucky. Dad was born on August 21, 1914, the son of the late Franklin "Dock" and Cora Tackett. Mom entered this life, March 24, 1922, the daughter of the late Ulysses Grant and Magdalene Tackett. .In February 1937, Mom and Dad were united in marriage. Very poor and barely kids themselves, they struggled and managed to raise seven children, 3 boys and 4 girls. Dad was a retired coal miner from Wheelwright, Kentucky, and member of The United Mine Workers of America. Mom was a homemaker and member of the Long Fork Old Regular Baptist Church. In September 1973, a car crash claimed the life of Mom and Dad's baby son, James Mason, who was only 27 years old. Dad had the dreaded disease, black lung, which developed into cancer. We feel the Lord had a better place for him and ended his suffering in June 1989, at the age of 74. Mom and Dad's daughter, Shirley Ann Ethridge, had bone cancer and was called home, only 4 months later, October 1989, making her stay here on earth only 49 years. She was a member of the Long Fork Freewill Baptist Church. June 1991, we lost our precious Mother, to leukemia, skin cancer and other illnesses, at the age of 69. Perhaps, she could not bear to face another death in the family, as she knew her baby sister, Bonnie Ann Tackett was dying with lung cancer. Approximately two months later, Aunt Bonnie passed away at the age of 61. June 1992, Mom and Dad's son, Clyde Eugene, suffered his second massive heart attack, while at work and never recovered. He was only 48 years old and getting ready to retire, after 30 years at General Motors. We have lost five members of our family in less than 3 years. In the immediate family, only four of us remain: Redgal Dale Tackett of Plymouth, Michigan, Ruby Jewell Tackett of Ypsilanti, Michigan, Hannah Francis Fleming and Teresa Gayle Lewis, both of Virgie, Kentucky. Other survivors include 13 grandchildren, 12 great grandchildren, Dad's two sisters - Delphia Steffey of Marion, Ohio and Mae McCown of Virgie, Kentucky. Mom left one brother, Virgil Tackett, and one half sister, Tina Johnson, both of Virgie, Kentucky. The hard work, raising us children, and the lack of money, left very little in life for Mom and Dad to enjoy. Our needs and the needs of others always came first. We thank God, they lived long enough to celebrate their 50th Wedding Anniversary, February 1987, at the Johnson Elementary School, Long Fork of Virgie. The pictures and videos of this special event are two of the most treasured gifts Mom and Dad left behind. The family and a host of friends and neighbors watched as they so enthusiastically opened their gifts. The light in their eyes and sweet smiles was a sight to behold. We feel that was only a small portion of the happiness which they are enjoying today, united with loved ones passed on. We miss them with all our hearts, but we feel they are "ALL" together in God's loving arms. Their spirit and most precious memories will remain in our hearts forever, especially those moments when we were all safe at home together. We have lost, but Heaven has gained abundantly. Mom left us a priceless gift of songs that she wrote and recorded. In those songs she pleads with us to meet her around God's Great Throne, and she promised to be waiting at the gate. Somehow, we feel they will all be waiting there. What a glorious and happy reunion that will be! Written by the Remaining Brokenhearted Children</p>

<p>In loving memo but with sad and broken hearts we will write an obitua of the most precious Wife and Mother, who ever lived, "Bonnie Ann Tackett". Mom was born in Pike County, Kentucky on October 5, 1929, and was called away to that eternal place in Heaven, August 26, 1991, making her stay here on earth, 61 years. She was the daughter of the late Ulysses Grant and Magdalene Tackett. In April 1946, Mom and Dad (Orlando Chester Tackett) were united in marriage. To this union was born 6 children, 3 sons and 3 daughters. She is survived by her husband, Orlando of Ecorse, Michigan and 6 children -Patsy Gay Rumsley and Kimberely Ann Jacobs, both of Tucson, Arizona, Rita Carol Tackett of Lincoln Park, Michigan, Terry Allen, Perry Joe and Shannon Dale Tackett, all of Ecorse, Michigan. Other survivors include 10 grandchildren, one brother, Virgil Tackett and one half-sister, Tina Johnson, both of Virgie, Kentucky. In 1963, Mom and Dad moved to Michigan, in order to make a better living for our family. Dad worked for General Motors and Mom for a dry cleaners. Life was hard and yet it was good, because we had what mattered most - health, love and the security of just being together as a family. Mom was a "special" person to all who knew her. She was always there, especially in bad times for those who needed her, whether it be to comfort them, to talk or just to listen. Her love, memory and spirit will remain with us to guide us through life. She was not only a wife and mother, but the greatest friend anyone could have. She just couldn't do enough for others. Her needs were the last thing on her mind. Mom fought for 16 months to stay here with us, after her illness was diagnosed, because she didn't want to leave her family. We feel that God had a better place prepared for her, where she is free from pain, sorrow and worry. We feel she is happy, united with family loved ones who preceded her, in death. The void in our homes and our hearts, left by the passing of our Mother will never be filled. We are so sad without our dear, sweet Mother, but happy for her, as we believe she has found eternal happiness in that Heavenly home. In our hearts, we believe that she is in the hands of God, and what better place can there be for an humble, loving Mother and Wife such as she? Our loss is great, but Heaven's gain is even greater, by adding one more precious soul to the fold, "Our Mother. Written by Her Brokenhearted Husband and Children</p>

<p>Was born March 6,1914 and went to be with the Lord on December 4,1990. She was the daughter of the late Ballard and Hannah Little. Mom and Dad, the late Leonard Tackett, were united in holy matrimony on May 25,1932. To this union was born four children, Hobert Dale, Beavercreek, Ohio; Charlotte Doraine Booher, Kettering, Ohio; Lynn Randall, Virgie, Kentucky and Lynda Carroll Ratliff, Paintsville, Kentucky. Mom left four children and in-laws: Hobert Dale and wife, Joyce; Charlotte and husband, Gary; Lynn Randall and wife DiAnn; Lynda Carroll and husband, Gary; four granddaughters, Nevilyn Mae, Tawnya Michelle, Candice Dawn and Gayla Denise; two grandsons, Anthony Dale and Shawn Keith; two step-grandsons, Dennis Jeffrey and Douglas Neal; three great grandsons, Alonzo Craig, Benjamin Pierce and Solomon Lewis; one greatgranddaughter, Bailey Price; four half sisters, Draxie Hall, Luenda Burke, Irene Little and Alloween Little; one step-sister, Della Tackett. Mom and Dad shared more than 57 years together before God called Dad home. They were never separated except for work and during hospital stays. They were very close and loved each other very much. Mom was the finest, most patient and most understanding person we have ever known. Her loving and caring ways touched the lives of many during her life time. Mom remained so strong and was so patient as she cared for Dad during his long-term illness. We learned of Mom's terminal illness two days before Dad passed away. God knows best and he chose to take Mom home only one year, one month and five days after Dad left us. God's grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. II Corinthians 12:9. Mom was a Godly woman. She feared the Lord. She loved the Lord, and according to her testimony, she accepted the Lord. Although Mom did not join the church by water baptism, when she accepted the Lord, she received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that is what is required to be born again. She expressed her love for the Lord and the church not only with words but by the life she lived. Mom left a beautiful example for her children, relatives, friends and neighbors to follow. Our lives are touched daily by the sweet memories Mom left us. Mom, we love and miss you very much but we know our loss is heaven's gain. Written By Her Children</p>

<p><strong>DUANE "MAG00" LITTLE</strong> <a href="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1992/wpe66454.gif"><img src="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1992/1992.h1.gif" alt="wpe66454.gif (71362 bytes)" width="72" height="80"></a></p>
<p>With a saddened and broken heart, I will try, with the help of the GOOD LORD, to write the obituary of my beloved husband, Duane. Duane was the son of Milton and the late Anna Rose Martin Little of McDowell, Kentucky. He was born May 15, 1944, in the family home at Minnie, Kentucky. He departed this world September 10,1991, making his stay on earth 47 years, 4 months, and 25 days. On October 15, 1966, Duane married Sharon Rose Hall. To this union was born two sons, Jeffrey Duane and Shaun Douglas. These boys were the pride of his life, and he loved them both dearly. Duane, it would make you so happy to know that we now have the daughter that we so wanted; on May 23, 1992, Jeff married Melissa. Sometimes we don't know how well liked and respected someone is until they have passed away. This was evident at Duane's funeral. I know that Duane was watching and that he was very pleased. I believe that if Jeff and Shaun can follow in his footsteps and become half the person that Duane was, they will go far in this life. Jeff and Shaun, I know how much you loved your dad, and I loved him very much also. But, GOD loved him more. Duane can't come back to us, but if we live our lives to serve the LORD, someday we can go to him, and we'll all be together again. Remember boys, Duane will never die as long as we keep his memory and his love alive in our hearts. Duane is survived by his wife, Sharon, two sons, Jeff and Shaun, his father and step-mother, Milton and Alice Little of Fairborn, Ohio, his sister Sharon R. Blair of Fairfield, Ohio. Also 5 nieces, 4 nephews, his Aunt Black and Uncle Wendell, whom he loved so dearly, as well as his 94 year old grandfather, Ellis Martin. Duane also left a host of friends and relatives who mourn his passing. UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN MY LOVE. Written by his wife and sons, Sharon, Jeff and Shaun</p>
