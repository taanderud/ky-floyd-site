<p><u><b>JAMES EDWARD CAUDILL:</b></u></p>
<p>Rejoice with them that rejoice ans weep with them that weep...a commandment 
God gives us as we travel here on earth.</p>
<p>His footstool. Through God's infinite mercies and his strength under girding 
us, we will try, by request of the family to write the obituary of our dear 
nephew James Edward Caudill.</p>
<p>James E. Caudill, Jimmy was born into this life August 20, 1955 departed this 
life June 29, 1980 making his stay here on earth 24 years ten months, and eight 
days. Born the only child to Herbert and Marietta Caudill Jr. making much joy in 
their home till that call went out and Jimmy answered the appointment we all 
will keep.</p>
<p>Beside his mother and father he leaves to mourn his passing his grandfather 
Herbert and grandmother Mary (deceased) Mattie Caudillof Premium, Kentucky and 
grandmother Minnie Sexton of Colson, Kentucky (the widow of the late Elder John 
Sexton). Also a host of aunts and uncles survive.</p>
<p>A flower has been taken, one that fulfilledthe joy of parent- hood resting 
under that Great Altar, waiting for that joyful day of ressurection, God's 
own-redeemed. Jimmy was loved by all that knew him, a smile for those he met. 
Hardly had he time in his short stay here to wander far away.</p>
<p>To Herbert and Marietta - don't let that ring of love in Heaven be severed. 
Let God enter your lives that you may be united again. To his many friends and 
family - be close together in this life, share and love one another, this is 
only the first one to share sorrow over, but its inevitable if we live here long 
enough.</p>
<p>Repent and let God be your Saviour, that Heaven may be yours and the family 
united over there together. Our humblest prayers and God's consoling peace rest 
and remain with each of you.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b><u>ADA SLONE:</u></b></p>
<p>Ada Slone was born February 23, 1897. She departed this life December 24, 
1978, making her stay here on earth 81 years nine months and 24 days. She was 
the daughter of Aminda and Perry Slone.</p>
<p>Early in life she met this wonderful man Miles M. Slone who preceeded her in 
death on April 30, 1977. She mirried Miles in 1913 and unto this union were born 
11 children one preceeded her in death, which leaves ten still living.</p>
<p>Camellus Slone of Tennessee, Myrtle Pratt of Michigan Clyde Slone of Albany, 
Ohio; Marie Prater of Dundas, Ohio; Winston Slone of Kendallville, Indiana; 
Herman Slone of Missouri ; Ruby Tiller of West Virginia; Ruth Pyck of 
Kendallville, Indiana; Mirando Slone of Dunsas, Ohio; and Bernard Slone of 
Alburn, Indiana; and one step- daughter Brookie Tiller of Oak Hill, Ohio.</p>
<p>Mother has been a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church family for about 
40 or 50 years. She was a hard working woman, raising her children, but was so 
loving and kind to us all. I am sitting here in my home tonight so lonesome for 
my mother and dad.</p>
<p>Miranda and mother made their home with my husband, Melvin and me after dad 
died. Miranda and I took such good care of her with Melvin's help. I guess there 
wasn't anything we didn't try to do for her and dad. She would want the brothers 
and sisters in the church to come and have services. They were sweet to us all 
in time of our sickness and death of our loving mother and dad. She has several 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren who miss her very much.</p>
<p>She had her fellowship with Maggie Home Church in Dundas, Ohio. I feel like I 
will meet them both in that beautiful home around the throne of God. I walk and 
talk with them in my dreams at night.</p>
<p>There is just no way of putting on paper how much I loved my mother and dad, 
only God knows my heart.</p>

<p><b><u>EARL TACKETT:</u></b></p>
<p>With the help of God, I will attempt to write an obituary oy my precious 
brother, Earl Gene Tackett.</p>
<p>Earl was born December 13, 1938 in Weeksbury, Ky and died January 24, 1980 in 
New Boston. Michigan, making his stay here on earth just forty two years.</p>
<p>Earl was the son of Sol and Annie Osborne Tackett. He was married to Shirley 
Smith in 1956. To them were born four children; one daughter, Debra; three sons 
Jeffery, Wade, and Wayne. He leaves his family, four brothers James, Clarence, 
Sol Jr, and Oscar Robert; and five sisters Kathryn, Bertha, Margie, Mae, and 
Mary. Many friends and relatives mourn his loss.</p>
<p>Earl was a hard woeker and a good provider for his family. He was a frim 
believer in work and respect.</p>
<p>He taught his children that all through life. He was good to people and had 
more friends than I could men- tion. God knows all things and he is the Judge. 
He does all things for a purpose.</p>
<p>Earl will be missed in our family reunion this year.</p>
<p>But I hope someday we can have a bigger and better reunion in Heaven, where 
there won't be anymore heart attacks, and things to take our loved ones away. I 
want to say to all the family that has not repented, to repent and live for 
Jesus, for Jesus and His way. We all love and miss Earl so muchand I know his 
good companion and children have spent many lonely hours. But be patient and 
press on.</p>

<p><u><b>NANCY THOMAS:</b></u></p>
<p>The obituary of Sister Nancy Thomas R. R. 6 Greensburg, Indiana, born August 
10, 1901in Whitesburg, Kentucky, the dau- ghter of Jake Adams, departed this 
life December 30, 1979 at 8:30 a.m. at the Margaret Mary Hospital in Batesville, 
Indiana.</p>
<p>On April 5, 1924 she was married to Culbert Thomas and unto this union were 
born six children two daughters Mrs. Rolland</p>
<p>(Nina) Mozingo, Greensburg, Indiana; and Mrs. Bobby (Shelby) Bockover of 
Greensburg, Indiana and four sons: Richard Thomas of Greensburg, Indiana; Gerald 
Gay Ocoee, Florida; Gobel Lan- caster, California, and Lawrence C. died in 
infancy.</p>
<p>She leaves her good companion five children 14 grand- children one 
great-grandchild, two sisters and many many friends and loved ones to mourn her 
passing. Sister Nancy joined the Old Regular Baptist Church at Thornton, Letcher 
County, ky and in the year 1956, she came to Little Pilgrim's Home Church near 
Milan, Indiana by letter and attended faithfully to all the Sister Churches that 
she could and as long as she was able. Surely, everyone that knew Sister Nancy 
can say she really let her light shine and will always be remembered by her 
brothers and sisters in the Lord and friends of this community.</p>
<p>Sister Nancy lived her life and I feel that she is now resting in the 
Paradise of God. So Culbert, to you and the children we can't bring her back 
now, but by the Grace of God. we can go where we feel she has gone. So children 
please make it as soon as you can. Sister Nancy's body sleeps at Little 
Children's Home Church Cemetery, Laurel, Indiana.</p>

<p><b><u>LILLIE THORNSBERRY:</u></b></p>
<p>It is with great sorrow and grief we will try to write this obituary of our 
loving mother, Lillie Thornsberry. She was born December 19, 1906 in 
Prestonsburg, Kentucky and died Nov- ember 13, 1979, making her stay on earth 72 
years ten months and 12 days. She was a very good mother to us and we loved her 
so much that words can not tell.</p>
<p>She has left behind to mourn her loss; three daughters Mary Alice Hall, 
Maggie Hicks, and Ethel Risner, all of Willard, Ohio and her husband Joe 
Thornsberry and six step-children, Mrs. Marvis Tackett of Plymouth; Howard 
Thornsberry of Cleve- land, and Alvin of Detroit, Michigan. She also had 19 
grand- children, 25 great-grandchildren 28 step-grandchildren and three step 
great-grandchildren. She had one sister left to bear her grief- Osie Ousley of 
Stockbridge, Michigan and a host of friends and relatives.</p>

March 3, 1957 and two sons Curtis Ousley who died April 9, 1969 and Warren 
Ousley who died December 9, 1978. Also she has lost five brothers and sisters

Heaven, but most of all, Jesus our Lord and Savior. Mom had been a member of the

<p><b><u>EARL HALL:</u></b></p>
<p>By request of the family, with sadnessin my heart, I will try to write an 
obituary of my beloved brother Earl Hall. He was born at Etty, Pike County, 
Kentucky, November 4, 1917 and departed from this life August 1, 1979, making 
his stay on earth 61 years. nine months and four days. He was the son of the 
late James Ellis and Judy Bentley Hall.</p>
<p>In early life, he was married to Leona Mullins. To this union were born ten 
children. Sister Leona and Little Hubert and Betty preceeded him in death. He 
later married Shirley Syck. To this union were born two children. Other than his 
wife he leaves to mourn six sons - Hurston of Paintsville, Kentucky; Eugene and 
Roger, both of Greysville, Alabama; Marvin of Ypsilanti, Michigan; Earl Kent and 
Jason both of Trenton, Michigan; four daughters - Dean Mullins of Vinton, Ohio, 
Janice Mullins of Bidwell, Ohio, Gwen Skinner of Greysville, Alabama and Rhonda 
Gulyban of River View, Michigan. 20 grandchildren six great grandchildren, two 
brothers Milford of Dorton, Kentucky and Leonard of River Rouge, Michigan; one 
sister Draxie Tackett of Thurman, Ohio and a host of friends and relatives 
survive.</p>
<p>He spent his working years, 21 years as a coal miner before going to the 
steel industry at McClouth Steel Corp. in Trenton, Michigan where he worked 20 
years. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church 21 years ago. For many years, he 
had his letter at the Little Pearl Church at Vinton, Ohio.</p>
<p>The last years of his life he sufferedvery much. He bore his afflictions with 
patience until the end. The pale horse and his rider came by that August evening 
at 7:10 p.m. at the Seaway Hospital in Trenton, Michigan. I will always remember 
the wonderful talks I had with him the last few months of life. He was umble.</p>
<p>We all miss him very much. His happy smiles and loving voicewill never greet 
us in this world anymore. Brother Earl has gone home to die no more over on 
Canaan's Happy Shore. With Jesus from Galilee in that Kingdom that has no end. 
Where no sorrows ever come. Many seasons may come and time will pass away. He 
will rise on that great Judgement morning.</p>
