    <strong>SHERDAIN TACKETT <a href="images/../public_html/ORB_Photos/1979/sherdain_tackett_ORB.jpg"><img src="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1979/sherdain_tackett_ORB_small.jpg" alt="sherdain_tackett_ORB.jpg (15895 bytes)" width="57" height="50"></a></strong>    I will try with the help of God to write an obituary of my beloved father, Sherdain Tackett. He was the son of Green and Ruthey Newsome Tackett. He was born August 18, 1896, and deceased this life October 23, 1978; making his stay here on earth 83
    years 2 months and 12 days. He was married to Sarah Hall in the year of 1814, and to this union was born 13 children; two preceded him in death, leaving his wife Sarah Tackett, two daughters Gerty Bolen of Kendallville, Indiana, Sola Williams of Printer,
    Kentucky and nine sons: Joe, Lee, Walker, and Earl all of Kendallville, Ind., Freel Tackett of Ecorse, Mich., Raymond J. of Oklahoma, Charles Tackett of Lexington, Kentucky, and Robert Tackett of Springfield, Ohio. He left 55 grandchildren, 33 great
    grandchildren, 12 great great grandchildren, and a host of friends to mourn his loss. We feel he as went to sleep in the arms of Jesus. He talked so to us about Jesus and the home that was prepared for him. I believe someday I will see him again,
    where there will be no sickness, troubles or pain. He was sick for many years. He was a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church since October 23, 1966, and was baptized by Elder J. P. Hall. I would say to the children that haven't made peace with
    Jesus; if you ever want to see Daddy again you will have to fall out with sin and be born again. Daddy loved you so much. I pray that you will turn to Jesus before its to late. I could go on writing the good things about him. I'd love to say to all
    the children we want to remember our sister Gerty and her husband Shelton Bolen who took such good care of our daddy. In the Books of Psalms 16 Chapter, verse 9; therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope for
    thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption at thy right hand there are plea. sures for everyone. Remember God loves all of you so be pre, pared to meet dad in that beautiful Home where we can live
    for ,r, ever never to part. May God bless all that reads this. Written by Elder Ballard Williams, and his broken hearted Daughter, Sola Williams

    <p><strong>MAGGIE SALMONS <a href="images/../public_html/ORB_Photos/1979/maggie_salmons_ORB.jpg"><img src="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1979/maggie_salmons_ORB_small.jpg" alt="maggie_salmons_ORB.jpg (13246 bytes)" width="60" height="50"></a></strong>        I have lost a very precious person, my mother. I will try with a very sad heart to write her obituary, she was born May 28, 1905 to the late Mexico and Nancy Jane (Ousley) Pitts, she was married to Boonie Salmons and to this union were born 9
        children, 4 infants preceded her in death, the 5 surviving children are Herman and Buford Salmons, Franklin, Ohio, Raymond Salmons, Claypool, In., Mary N. Ousley, Silver Lake, In. and Tealie Goble, Warsaw, In. Mom joined the church over 30 years
        ago at Spurlock and attended there until she came to Indiana and here she attended the Northern Little Dove and surrounding churches, you couldn't hardly get her to church early enough, she loved visiting with the people and hearing the singing
        and good preaching, we would get in the car to come home after church and she say "Nancy" how did you like to hear this one preach or that one preach, she was a faithful member as long as she was able to go to church, she was at a communion meeting
        when she took sick, she shouted during church, they noticed something was wrong when Sister Barbara Flannery was washing her feet, Sister Barbara asked her if something was wrong and mom told her not to worry about her that she was alright, that
        is one consolation I have, I know she is at rest. She was homesick for heaven, she would hear of a death and she would say, "why couldn't that have been me"? I went to get her at the church house at North Judson, In., she never spoke another word,
        she had a fatal stroke, she lay in a coma three days. Mom raised us children by herself, we wore a lot of hand me downs and didn't have much to eat a lot of times but there is one thing we had, a loving mother and very good advice, she prayed
        so much for her children. Her struggle here on earth is over, she has gone to rest from that struggle and awaits that g lorious morning when God comes to gather his children home, I believe Mom will be one in that number. I could write a book
        but this is getting lengthly. She leaves to morn her death 4 brothers, Hobert Pitts, Allen Pitts, Darvis Pitts, and R. L. Pitts, 21 granchildren, 8 great-grandchildren and a host of friends and relatives. A precious one from us is gone A voiced
        so loved is stilled A place made vacant in the home That never can be filled. Written by her broken hearted daughter, Mary Nancy Ousley</p>

        to Joppa Regular Baptist church at Melvin, Kentucky, for several years. I want to say to her husband (Hayden) press on and keep the Faith and you can meet with your loving wife again where there will be no more sorrow or pain. I also want to say
        to her two brothers and one sister in Flesh, if you want to meet with sister Dorothy again, fall out with sin and call upon the same God Dorothy did. He never turns a praying soul away. You can meet sis and cousin Dorothy again in the Glory Land

        miss her very much because when I pass by her home, she would be sitting on the porch but now her chair is empty. I know F. D. misses her most of all, because in her ill health he waited upon her very patiently, but one cold December night, the
        Angels came and took her home to live with "Jesus". Aunt Lissie belonged to Joppa Regular Baptist Church for many years at Melvin, Kentucky. She filled her seat as long as she was able, but now her seat is empty, she was the oldest member at that
        time.I want to say to the three living children if you haven't made peace with the one Aunt Lissie begged you to, it is not too late to start. If you want to see Mother again, for I believe she is resting around the Throne of "God" where she suffers
        no pain. She had many grandchildren and great grandchildren, and probably many great, great grandchildren, so I say to them also get on the straight path which leads to Heaven and you can meet grandma again. So sleep on "Aunt" and "Mother". I
        her niece (Hazel) has a hope of meeting her again. I know "children" you loved "Mother" but "Jesus" loved her more. Hazel Henson Langley (Niece) F. D. Cole (Son)</p>

Survivors include three sons: Burlin Caudill, Virgil Caudill, and Wilburn Caudill.
        Three daughters: Mallie, Judy and Shirley. She also leaves behind her husband William to mourn her loss, and also four brothers: Evan, Ben, John L., and Merlin Hall and two sisters: Rosa Johnson and Sara Harris. She had 9 grandchildren and one
        great grandchild. Early in life she met and married William and no doubt they worked very hard to raise their children. Though they lived 53 years together, they can look back and see that its only been but a few days and full of trouble as Job
        said about it. "A man that is born of woman is but a few days and full of trouble." They had many happy moments together, but the best moment of her time was when she closed her eyes in death to awake in the arms of Jesus. William said he believes
        her soul is at rest. I want to say, the family knew more about her than all the neighbors and friends, because they were with her day in and day out. So children, let me say you will never see Mother as she was, but by the Grace of God, you can
        be with her in that City that God has gone and prepared for all that love his appearing. So children as I close, let me say to you all, you still have dad. Be good to him and to one another. Written by Elder Ellis Holbrook</p>

    <p>Sister Oshie was born Oct. 8, 1900 in Paintsville, Ky., the daughter of the late John Wesley Collins and Nancy Elizabeth Lawson, and passed away Sunday, January 28, 1979 in a Shreveport, Louisiana hospital. Early in life, she met and married Dewey
        Bryant who preceded her in death. He was an Ordained Elder in the Regular Baptist Church. Sister Oshie is survived by seven sons: Eugene of Ind., Delmar of Ohio, Frank and Jackson of Mich., Earl and James of Fremont Ohio, and Wendell of Washington.
        Two daughters: Mrs. Ruth Govle of Ohio and Mrs. Justine Yennor of Michigan. A brother, Jesse Collins of Ohio and a sister, Mrs. Mae Newsome of Ky. Also surviving were 29 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. Sister Oshie was a member of the
        Joppa Regular Baptist Church and she always attended regular until she moved to Michigan, but sister Oshie always returned for our communion and did she enjoy it. I can see her as I write this obituary, rejoicing in the Lord as the brothers and
        sisters began to sing the old songs of Zion and to preach the Gospel of King Jesus. Oh children, if you could see her as I, you would say, "Mother I'll meet you some sweet day around the Throne of God where we will be together eternally. So children,
        I could go on writing about your mother and those many times I've been in Church with her, but I'm sure you children know her life better than anyone else. May I close by saying as the Psalmist David, "She is gone from us and can no more come
        to us, but by the Grace of God, we can go to her." Written by Elder Ellis Holbrook</p>

    <p><strong>MARTHA TACKETT <a href="images/../public_html/ORB_Photos/1979/martha_tackett_ORB.jpg"><img src="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1979/martha_tackett_ORB_small.jpg" alt="martha_tackett_ORB.jpg (8111 bytes)" width="79" height="57"></a></strong></p>
    <p>By the help of the Lord, I will try and write a short obituary of this dear sister in the Lord - to wit Sister Martha Tackett. She was the daughter of the late Mayland Johnson and Usley Hall Johnson. Early in life, she met and married Brother Lint
        Tackett and to this union was born six children. Two sons: Truman and Herman Tackett of Weeksbury, Kentucky. Four daughters: Mrs. Hazel Vanover and Mrs. Victoria Vanover, of Weeksbury, Kentucky. Mrs. Vada Hall and Mrs. Anna Lee Hall of Michigan.
        Sometime ago, Sister Martha and Brother Lint got to thinking of death and needed a Savior and went to Jesus for their help. We believe after they suffered for their sins, Jesus came to their rescue and delivered them out of sin and set them on
        the Rock and on their way to Heaven. Sister Martha and Brother Lint were both members of the Joppa Regular Baptist Church of Melvin, Kentucky. They attended church as long as they were able to go. After Brother Lint crossed the chilly tide, Sister
        Martha was so lonely and longed to go to be with her loved one. So Children, you knew your mother's life better than anyone. Take the Council she gave you all and meet them in that country where we, the Children of God will be satisfied and not
        have to depart anymore. Sister Martha also has one brother living, Brother Charley Johnson, of Weeksbury, Kentucky, also a member of the Joppa Church. Brother Charley, being left alone, no doubt knows that the next call will be for him. Sister
        Martha and Brother Lint loved for the Brothers and Sisters of the Church to come and visit them, and the love they had for their neighbors was great. So we all miss them very much and the children are having their Memorial preached the 4th Saturday
        and Sunday in May 1980, at the home place and everyone is welcome. The family wants to thank everyone that stood by the family in their time of sorrow. May God bless all. Written by Assisted by Elder Alvin Caudill Elder Ellis Holbrook</p>

    <p>With sadness and a very weary heart I will try to write the obituary of my mother Rebecca Tackett. She was the daughter of Ben and Elizabeth McCowan Tackett. She was born November 26th, 1896 and passed away May 1, 1979, making her stay 82 years 5
        months and 6 days. She was married May 3, 1917 to Henry Tackett and unto this union was born eight children. Five girls and three boys. Two girls died in infancy. One son and also her husband preceded her in death, leaving two sons and three girls.
        Oliver Tackett of Weeksbury, Kentucky, and Elzie Tackett of Gahanna, Ohio. Gladys McKinney of Weeksbury, Kentucky, Edith Akers of Melvin, Kentucky, and Sadie Johnson of Weeksbury, Kentucky. Mom joined the Old Regular Baptist Church May 30, 1937.
        She lived a faithful life and attended church as long as she was able. Then after she got sick she would have the children to ask the Brothers of the Church to come and have her a little meeting. She was one of the kindest sweetest mothers on
        earth not only to her children and grandchildren but to all her neighbors and their children and because of her kindness the whole neighborhood called her BeckyMa. She was never too tired as long as she could prepare something for any that came
        to eat. Her last few days she would talk mostly to Daddy and her babies. The ones in the hospital said when she sang "Will the Circle be Unbroken" she just seemed so happy. Then she wanted to know how all the family was at home when we told her
        all was okay her reply was, "I am going to stay with you a little while and then I am going on across and the sweetest smile I believe I ever saw came on her face and was still there as she left this world. No one knows the heartaches only those
        who have suffered can say nor of the grief that is silent for mother the one we loved so dear.Maybe someday we will come your way. Her memorial will be preached the 3rd Saturday and Sunday in July 1980.</p>

    <p><strong>HAYDEN REYNOLDS</strong> By request of a sister in hope I will try to write an obituary of Brother Hayden Reynolds, he was borned April 5th, 1911 and departed this life July 27th, 1979. Early in life he met and married Dorothy Cole Reynolds
        and unto this union no children was born. Dorothy proceeded him in death. Brother Hayden joined the Joppa Church of the Regular Baptist, the first Saturday in September 1962, and was baptized the same day by Elder Jerry Hall Sr. and Elder Charlie
        Jones. Brother Hayden didn't have any children to take care of him during his sickness, but I feel he had Jesus, and Jesus said, "In the day you give me your whole heart I'll be found with you, Job 5: 19 and he shall deliver thee in six troubles
        yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee. And I believe Brother Hayden is resting in the Paradise of God waiting for Jesus to come riding on the cloud of his glory to take his children home where there will be no sickness but it will all be
        peace and joy forever. So I would like to say to his relatives if you haven't already met Jesus in a pardon and remission of your sins, and if you ever want to see Brother Hayden again, you must fall out with sin and be born again. Written by:

        Wayne, Michigan, Five daughters, Bonnie Moore of Garrett, Kentucky, Darlene Hicks, of Maysville, Kentucky, Thelma Smith of North Judson, Ind., Freeda Combs of Westland, Michigan, and Ellen Cheatham of Garden City, Michigan. She is survived by
        fourteen grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. She joined the Old Regular Baptist Church about 1943, living in full love and fellowship with her brothers and sisters at the Stone Coal Church of which she was a member for all those years.
        Mom loved to fill her seat as long as she was able to attend church. She became ill and suffered so much during the last two years of her life, but she always had patience with her afflictions. Mom was always pleased when we could all get together
        for the family reunion. She would ask us to sing some of her favorite songs and seemed to enjoy it so much. While I was at her bedside in the hospital, she said "I love my saviour God." I tried to meet her request by singing that song. To see
        her raise her feeble hands and give glory and honor to Jesus brought so much joy to my soul. Another one of her favorite songs was "On the other side of Jordon." Now that she has made that crossing, she knows what it is like on the other side.&nbsp;
        Mother was blessed to see some her children profess a hope in Christ and come into the church. I believe it is the most beautiful bunch of flowers that a mother could receive when one of her children makes peace with God. The community in which
        she lived has suffered a loss and she will be missed so much by everyone. She left a bright and shining light for all of us. Precious memories of you dear mother will linger in our minds, so sleep on and take your peaceful rest in the arms of
        sweet Jesus. By the grace of God, we will meet again someday. Written by her son, and brother in Christ, Freeman Lawson</p>

Mom was born on November 21, 1906, to the union of the late Dollie and John Lawson. Mom passed away on January 28, 1979 at the St. Joseph's
        Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky, making her stay on earth 72 years. She married Kendle Frasure in June of 1924, and unto this union were born four daughters and four sons. Her husband and a daughter of eighteen months preceded her in death. Those
        children remaining to mourn their mother are: Bernice Spencer of Willard, Ohio. Tessie Medbourn of No. Judson, Ind., Janice Bolen of Garrett, Kentucky. Arnold Frasure of Romulus, Michigan. Jack Frasure of No. Judson, Ind., And Bobbie Frasure of
        Portage, Mom was a true christian who faithfully served her Lord for thirty years as a dutiful member of the Stone Coal Regular Baptist Church. She presented a light to her children that they might walk out of darkness. Although death has taken
        her light from this world, it still burns brightly in the hearts and minds of her children and friends who knew and loved her. Mom was gentle, kind and generous, and she was endowed with that old pioneer spirit which enabled her to boldly withstand
        hardships and sickness with a firm determination to overcome and continue on. She always accepted her sickness gracefully, and she never allowed any illness to interfer with the caring and welfare of her children or her husband. We came first
        in her life, even above her own comforts. She knew each of her children's favorite foods, and this particular food was waiting for us when we came to visit. Each of us could predict the menu before we arrived. I have never left after a visit with
        mom that I did not leave with a heart full of love and a filled stomach. Preacher Lawson once said that if there are assignments in Heaven my dad will be handing out food, and if this is true, mom will be preparing it. Mom and dad lived and loved
        a union of fifty years before his death on December 8, 1974. We felt that a great part of mom was buried with him. But mom became whole again as they were reunited in the early hours of January 28, 1979 when Jesus extended a joyous welcome home
        to her at Heaven's gate. Mom and dad will never again know the agony of separation, and now they await their children's homecoming. WILL OUR CIRCLE BE UNBROKEN? In loving memory of my mother, by her son, Jack Frasure And her children whose loss
        know no bounds</p>

        Bryant, known to everyone as "Dock", was born November 16, 1913 to Duran and Sarah Ann Bryant at Beefhide, Kentucky. At the age of 13 he was supporting his mother and three sisters. On May 15, 1936, he married Haley Tackett and she became his
        life-long companion. To this long, rich, at times troubled, but always loyal and loving union was born six sons and five daughters, all of whom survive their father. The sons are: Forrest Bryant of Pinckney, Michigan; Curt Bryant of Arlington,
        Virginia; Bobby Bryant, U. S. Army; Danny Bryant and Ronald Bryant, of Hi Hat, Kentucky and Gene Bryant of Lexington, Kentucky. The daughters are: Joyce Adkins, of Hi Hat, Kentucky, Fern Clark, Clotine Norris, and Gail Hall, all of Lexington,
        Kentucky; and Dixie Bryant of Nashville, Tennessee. There are also 15 grandchildren. Daddy labored for 34 years in the coal mines and spent what spare time there was farming, and on three occasions trying his hand at business. He had too big a
        heart to succeed in business, so most of his life was spent at hard work; the coal mines, farming, and raising his family. In March of 1974 Daddy and Mom, together as always, joined the Old Regular Baptist Church, and for the rest of his life
        were loyal and participating members of the Little Nancy Old Regular Baptist Church at Hi Hat, Kentucky. In his long and painful illness Mom was his constant companion, always at his side, suffering with him to the end. We join with her now in
        saying farewell to a kind and gentle man. Over the long years, he built up a reputation for hard work, honesty, and loving kindness. So let him be remembered that way-a hard-working man who always took care of his own; an honest man who won the
        respect of all who knew him; and, above all, a man with enough love in his heart not only for all of us but for everyone he met. "Little Dock" we love you and we are proud to call yo,, father. Written by his loving wife, sons, and daughters.</p>

    <p><strong>CROFFORD MOSLEY</strong> Crofford Mosley, the son of Clabe and Polly Mosley. Born April 16, 1899. On December 14, 1978 about the third watch of the night, then silently and swiftly that heavenly host of angels visited the U. K. Medical Center
        in Lexington, bringing a honorable discharge. No more will we join our voices to sing. I come to the spot where the white pilgrim lay, but them that remains the echo of your voice will still ring. The same hand that led me through scenes dark
        and deary, will kindly conduct me safe home. In the year of 1917, Brother Crofford married a young woman, Sister Bell Truman, and unto this union were born 9 children, 2 preceded him very early in life. Two more Sylvan and June Anna after they
        were grown, leaving 5 - Jewel, Iva, Broma, Dorothy, and Langley, and his dear wife. He had 22 grandchildren, 20 great grand children, 1 sister Elizabeth Hall, 1 brother Tom Mosley, and many other close relation. Brother Crofford told us his experience
        in roaming the swamps and hills of Virginia till he found the mercies of God. When all hopes seemed to be gone, God came to his rescue and saved his Soul. Soon he joined the Old Regular Baptist Church not long after that he felt the call to the
        ministry and began to preach the unperishable riches of God's love to a dying world of mankind. So, somewhere in the flower garden of the paradise of God there awaits a soul for that great resurrection morning. Five sisters and two brothers have
        already crossed deaths cold stream. Father and mother also have been gone along time. Write blessed are the dead that die in the Lord. Written by: Elder Bert Hall</p>

        James Kent Dye, and Josie Ann Cornett. They also had 73 grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren, and a host of friends and relatives, to mourn their loss. I believe our loss is Heaven's Gain. Mom joined the Old Regular Baptist Church of Jesus
        Christ in 1940, and filled her seat as long as she was able. I want to say to Mom and Dad's children and grandchildren and loved ones that you know not Jesus in a Pardon and Remission of your sins that you must be Born again, if you ever want

    <p><strong>REBECCA TACKETT</strong> The subject of this sketch was born in Mingo County, W. Va. August 19, 1837. She was the daughter of a Pioneer Regular Baptist preacher to wit: Rev. Jessie Caudill. She was married to Abel Tackett, Sr., February 22,
        1855. She joined the Long Fork Church of Regular Baptist April the third Saturday, 1879. And was baptized on the third Saturday in May, 1879 by Rev. William McCown. From that day up to the end of her earthly life, she lived the life of a faithful
        christian. We believe the world was made better by the life of this noble christian woman, Her examples of virtue and modesty will live in the minds of her children, grandchildren and neighbors for many years to come. We were truly grieved to
        give up this good sister and mother but it pleased God whom she has served so faithful for about thirty three years to call for her and to take her from this world of trouble into a world of eternal rest, where today we do believe she is sweetly
        resting on the "banks of sweet Canaan" in company with her dear old father, husband and daughter who crossed the stormy Jordon before her, Yes in company with a host of Angels. All playing on harps of gold awaiting redemption, to wit: the redemption
        of their bodies. The funeral of sister Tackett will be preached on the second Saturday and Sunday in September, 1914. All of her relatives, friends and neighbors in fact all lovers of christian virtue is invited to be present. Written by: Willard

        and Artie Newsome Clarke, making her stay on earth 75 years and 12 days. She deceased this life one cold January Day in 1970 at Mercy Hospital, Portsmouth, Ohio. Mom was married to our father in early years at the age of 13 years old. Our father
        was the son of Bud and Mary Ann Jones Henson. Dad left us in the year and day Januarv 19, 1924. To Mom and Dad were born 6 children, Troy Henson, deceased; Gracie Henson, deceased,; Leonard Henson, deceased; Jeanette Nenson, deceased; Maudie Edmonds
        of Francisco, Indiana; Hazel Langley, Robinson Creek, Kentucky, Mallie Allen of Franklin Furnace, Ohio. Dad left Mom to raise us children, which I feel she done a wonderful job. She worked very hard to raise us, but didn't seem to mind. I feel
        she done great by us. We didn't have what many fortunate children have today, but we were pleased with what she gave us. I can truthly say we never went dirty or hungry. She died with the dread disease of Leukemia. Mom always believed in the Old
        Regular Baptist. She never attached herself to the Church, but before leaving us she told Rev. Rodney she was just waiting for the Angels to open the gate. We brought her back to Kentucky at Ligon, Kentucky, where she lies today. I believe if
        we keep on trusting in a Merciful God, we will meet with her some day. Sadly years have come and gone, since she went away. The sadness still lingers in our hearts for it broke our hearts to see her go, because part of us went with her that day.
        So please Dear God, let her know that we did not forget for we loved her and miss her more each day. They say that time heals all broken hearts, but time so far has proven how much we miss her. As we stroll by her grave side and breathe a silent
        prayer, we ask Dear God, to help us bear our Burdens here. Sadly missed by her 3 daughters, Maudie Edmonds, Hazel M. Langley and Mallie Allen, 2 sons-in-laws, a number of grandchildren, great grandchildren, great great grandchildren. Written by

        seldom complained, he always had a comforting "pat on the shoulder" for everyone else, I am sure if he could speak to us now he would say "Love one another" and keep on that straight and narrow road to Heaven. He loved to talk about the Bible
        and to tell others how much God had done for him, about the miracles he performed, how he healed the sick, made the blind see and the lame to walk. The last scripture Brother Russell heard was Romans Chapter 14, verses: 7, 8, and 9: "For no man
        liveth to himsel and no man dieth to himself, for whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Whether we live therefore, or die, we that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. So to you my Brothers

        February 18, 1971) December 17, 1925. Since then dad was a lonely man. He said to us children many times, "I would love to go on to Heaven and be with your mom." Thank God He answered his prayers and took him on to Heaven to be with mom and give
        him that peace and happiness he was looking for. I know my dad met mom in Heaven because he died without a struggle and it seemed without pain. He yawned once and went to a peaceful sleep. Dad was baptized in the Bethel Regular Baptist Church
        in May 1962. I'm so glad my dad had a chance to live a christian life many years before leaving this world. He left six children and one foster child to mourn his death, Ila Bond, Wayne and John Adkins, Frances Vondenhuevel all of Sidney, Ohio,
        Elsa Compton of Tallahessee, Florida, Alice Isaac of Martin, Kentucky and Willa Vanness of Logan, West Virginia. Also surviving are 15 grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. Dad had a smile for everyone. We miss that smile and his kind words
        so much. He left an emptiness in our hearts that will never be filled until we meet with him and mom in Heaver some day. Dads life was just like mom's, the old time christiar way. Dad our loss is very great, but our loss is also Heavens gain I

        He was in the hospital so much this past year. Before he went to surgery about 6 months ago, he told me not to worry about him because he had been praying for a long time and that heavy burden was gone. He said after he had come home that he wanted
        to go to the Little Ettie Church. He said he would like to walk in, but if he wasn't able to walk in that he wanted to be carried in. Dad didn't leave a lot of money or worldly goods for his family, but he left the most precious gift - the hope
        of meeting again in heaven. I believe with all my heart Dad is resting and on that bright morning he will not have that big hole in his chest, no pain, and no more need for oxygen tanks. I'm looking and longing for that day to come. I hope and

        Lord to have mercy on him and with tears running down his cheeks he would cry "Oh Lord, let me go like a gentleman". He would reach out his hand to the religious people that came to see him to say a prayer with him. I feel deep down in this heart
        of mine that God heard those feel cries. He didn't belong to any church but his belief was in the Old Regular Baptist. We all loved him so much but God must have loved him better for about 6:45 p.m. on August 26, the sweet Master's Call came from
        Heaven and he just sweetly went to sleep in Jesus's arms and I believe he is with the Angels in Heaven. I want to say to all you children if we want to see Daddy again, we had better start praying and get on the right road to the Heavenly Gates.

        request of the family that I make this effort to write an Obituary of Blucher Kiser. He was the son of Elder Noah Kiser and Sister Dona Bryant Kiser. He was born March 6, 1936, died April 23, 1979. He was 43 years, 1 month and 18 days at the time

        Creek, Kentucky, Clara Jean Kiser, Rt. 4, Pikeville Kentucky. I the writer of this obituary have known Bluche Kiser from his early boyhood days. He was one of the most trust worthy young men that I ever had the pleasure of meeting with. He labored
        hard in the coal mines for twenty some year until he become disable. He was taken down to the Lexington Hospital and was operated on for stomach trouble. He didn' get any better in this old world but we do believe that his soul has gone to and
        upper and better world. We must be born again of God's Holy Spirit if we ever get to the Glory World. Bluche sure did love his dear wife Ruby and his sons. He would go an visit his dear old dad Bro. Noah Kiser when he was not able hardly to go.
        I just say Dear Wife, Father and Mother, Brother and Sisters your dear Brother has gone as we to believe to live with Jesus and his Holy Angels, so it is by the grace of God you all can go to him. So let me ask you all that haven't chosen that
        good part that Jesus said one thing is needful and Mary hat l chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her so Blucher was laid to rest in a little lonesome cemetary on Robinson creek, Kentucky. Sleep on Brother Blucher sleep on
        until that great day when the Lord shall descend from Heaven the trumpet shall sound a retreat of words then arise with a spiritual body not afflicted but alive by the Spirit of God to live forever more. May the God of Heaven Bless this family
        in their lonesome hours. From my heart I Pray your humble Brother. Elder Taulbee Kiser</p>

        Orlando, Florida. Two brothers George Elswick of Caney Creek and Dewey Elswick of Louisville, Kentucky. She also left 15 grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren. Mom joined the Caney Creek Old Regular Baptist Church in October 1952. She enjoyed
        filling her seat in the old church as long as she was able to attend. After her affliction got so bad that she had to lay 0 bed, it would please her so much when the children, friends, relatives and Brothers and Sisters of the old church would
        come and visit. We feel that her soul is in the Paradise of God with Brother Hansford, waiting until that great morning when God will send his Son and ransom our bodies from the power of the grave and fashion them like his most glorious body and

        beloved wife, and two children, two grandchildren: Calvin Jr. and Susan Renee Akers of Ypsilanti, Michigan, four brothers: Thurman and Richard Akers of Dana, Kentucky. Archer Akers of Washington, Michigan and Billy Ray Akers of Warren, Michigan.
        He was sick for quite a while but wouldn't give up. But the Lord had other plans for him, one night He took him home where he could rest without pain and worries. He loved the children so much and worried about them, but Daddy is not worrying
        now children. I am waiting for the day when we can be together again. So children start praying and get things right with the Lord so we can see Daddy again. Won't it be so wonderful to be in that beautiful home all together again. Written by

        5, 1979, both parents are deceased. His parents moved to Letcher County, Kentucky, where he spent his boyhood days, they later moved to Pikeville, Kentucky where Elder James Cook met and married Eulah Taylor, to this union was born 6 children,
        3 sons and 3 daughters, one son preceded him in death (Stephen) a small infant. James was always a good husband, a tender loving father, who worked hard to provide for his family. In the year of 1952 after several months of begging and praying,
        he found eternal life, the grace of God and joined the old Regular Baptist Church, he placed his membership at the Pikeville Church, which he dearly loved, after a year or so later James felt a great burden come upon his soul, this was a call
        from God to preach his ever lasting gospel, he always preached salvation by the grace of God and always gave glory and honor to God, he dearly loved his Brothers and Sisters and always treated them with a special love, and his fellow man with
        great compassion, his life was of a great benefit to the church, his family and to the world as well. James became ill in the month of November, 1978 after the discovery of the dreadful disease cancer, we both felt that the great God of all glory
        would heal him, but after many weary days of suffering with patience he was called out of this world, although we knew he couldn't live the blow was so great we couldn't hardly bear it, because we loved him so much, so sleep on sleep on my dear
        loved one and take your rest, perhaps before long when time shall be no more and he says it is enough we will unite once again in a world of Eternal peace and joy and God shall wipe all tears from our eyes, and together we shall praise him forever
        more. You are gone but not forgotten, memories of you linger on In my heart and mine forever Anchored by undying love. Written by his wife, Eulah Cook and aided by a Brother in Christ Elder Matt Justice</p>

        she always filled her seat in the old church. I feel Sister Lillie is resting from her labor, she is enjoying the singing of the Angels, where she won't have to worry about this old troublesome world any more, cheer up Brother Burley I know you
        are lonesome without your precious mate but God is able to take care of you for he said he wouldn't put more on us than we could bear. It gives us great joy to know we have an almighty God that we can lean upon in time of need. I will say to her
        children if there is one that hasn't made peace with God, don't let this day pass without calling upon his name, because we have no promise of tomorrow. Brother Burley I know you lost a good companion and children you lost a good mother, and the
        church lost a good member, but I feel our loss is Heaven's gain. The family circle is now broken, a link is gone from the chain, though we parted for a while we feel we'll meet again. Written for Brother Burley Kidd and children. By, Nancy Tackett</p>

    <p><strong>FRANCES FRASURE</strong> It is with much sadness that I attempt to write a short sketch of the life of our Sister, Frances Frasure. She was the daughter of William and Elizabeth Frasure. Sister Frances was born in Floyd County, Kentucky, May
        2, 1872, died January 8, 1915, being 42 years, 8 months and 6 days old. Sister Frances were married to Anthony Frasure in the year 1885, unto this union were born 14 children, 9 boys and 5 girls, 4 died in infancy. Sister Frasure professed a hope
        in Christ and was baptized into the fellowship of the Zion Church by Elder M. Akers, Frances lived a true christian life until her death, while she was living with her family she did not cease to give counsel concerning the power, love and mercy
        of her God during the time she lived in the church, which was about 14 years, I lived a close neighbor to her and we had many talks concerning her travel and the love of God. Sister Frances at one time became doubtful of her hope in Christ and
        prayed God to show her if she was right to show her a light, and a light appeared and shined around her. I was by the sister's bedside in her last hours on this earth and she told me she could see the angels all around her, she also said she could
        see a golden crown. The sister's favorite song was: I am wearied of life; I'm alone in this world; Take me home, dear Saviour, take me home. Sister Frances prayed earnestly to die. We believe while her husband and dear children mourn their loss
        on earth that her soul is at rest in the paradise of God and that Heaven is her home. Written by, Mahala Jones</p>

    <p><strong>ELDER LEWIS BRYANT & POLLY JANE HAMILTON BRYANT</strong> Dear Brothers and Sisters, I will try in much grief and sorrow to write an obituary of my father to wit Elder Lewis Bryant and Polly Jane Hamilton Bryant and unto this union was born
        13 children. My Father was born April 5, 1866 and died February 18, 1932 making his stay on earth 66 years. My Mother was born January 5, 1872 and died September 22, 1922 making her stay on earth 50 years. My father was married 1 time before he
        married my mother and unto this union was born 1 child a little girl. She was 3 months old when when her mother died, then 3 months later he married my mother that made 14 children my mother took care of her and she never made any difference in
        them. She treated her step child as if it were her own in every way. My mother had 6 boys and 7 girls and the little step daughter made 8 girls. The girls names are: Martha, Millie, Victoria, Lizzie, Phenie, Emma, Mary Alice, and the step daughter
        Mandy. The boys are: Lee, Mark, Monroe, Noah, Jarvey, and John Wess. Four children died when they were small 2 boys: Jarvey and Noah and the two girls were Martha and Phenie. As far as I can remember father was preaching the gospel, there were
        five children older than me so he must have started preaching before I was born, I believed he preached the gospel too because he had no education. I was a small girl but I can remember when my mother joined the church, they both belonged to the
        Old Regular Baptist Church. I had two brothers died with heart attacks, John Wess and Mark. I had two brothers shot to death, my baby brother Monroe and my oldest brother, Lee, neither of them thought they had an enemy in the world. I am the only
        one living, I am going on 81 years old. Five of the ones dead professed a hope two didn't belong to the church but I believed they professed a hope. I have lived a lonely life, we were poor people but we were honest people, we believed in the
        old time way. I believe I will meet the biggest part of my family again if not all of them. I have seen a lot of sorrow and trouble but the Lord has been with me or I couldn't have stood it. I raised four of my mothers children because they were
        small when she died Emma, Monroe, Victoria and Mark. I have seen a rough life, I am afflicted and don't get to go to church much but I don't forget to go to the Lord, I love to be with my brothers and sisters. I should have written this obituary
        before now but I have been sick and have seen so much trouble. I just couldn't get settled down enough, I could have written much more but time and space won't permit, It has already gotten very lengthy.</p>

        His passing was sudden and by many indications we believe that he might have felt he was nearing the end, we know he believed in God, for he was reading the Bible, and we believe was a praying man . "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst
        after righteousness: for they shall be filled." We believe by the life he lived, that he just exchanged a life of misery and strife to a life of joy and peace. I the writer worked with Raymond and many times he would come talk to me about the
        Lord and the church. Raymond was always a quiet, peaceful man, His nay was nay and yea was yea. He leaves to mourn, his wife, Sister Lois, 2 daughters, 1 grand child, 7 brothers and 6 sisters, 1 brother preceded him in death. Children, mommy and
        daddy were prepared to meet Jesus and I know they want you to meet them in a better place than this troublesome world. Flowers are beautiful, they live, they fade and they die, but memories live forever. Written by Elder Melvin Watts</p>

        his decease, he said that his pain was all gone and remarked, "Thank you Lord." After this he said, "That pretty sunshine!" Friday evening before his death, James visited his parents. He was pleased of the health condition of his father, given
        by the Surgery Clinic Report, made the same day. While talking with his parents, James told his mother that she might have to go to church. At the time of leaving he placed his hand upon Dad's shoulder and said, "I'll be seeing you." James Freddie
        became a member of the First Baptist Church at Mousie, July 13, 1975. He resented speaking evil against a church or member. After attending a Regular Baptist meeting and seeing his mother baptized, he stated that he had never seen a better day
        in his life. He made the remark many times that Jesus was the one that saves. The writing below, written by James, gives an idea of his church. On the opposite side of the writing is a picture of a cross with the words, Jesus Saves, upon it.&nbsp;
        It will bring other people into its worship and fellowship if I bring them. Therefore, with the help of God, I will dedicate myself F to the task of being all the things I want my church to be; and in doing so, I will be what God wants me to be.
        If it is to be, it is up to me. James Freddie Martin James Freddie was a veteran by being in Army service for five years, a graduate of Morehead University and a teacher at Garth Vocational School. Surviving him are his parents, Hubbard and Amy

        to Linville Wicker and unto this union was born 11 children. Her husband, Linville Wicker, died on December 4, 1962 and also two children, Maudie and Woodrow preceded her in death. She leaves to mourn her passing, 7 sons; Columbus of Mousie, Kentucky,

        Ratliff of Hamilton, Ohio. One sister, Martha Griffity, of Monticello, Indiana, 24 grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. Many kindred and friends also survive. On October 22, 1950 Sister Liza was baptized into the fellowship of Ball Branch
        Old Regular Baptist Church by Elder Earl Howard. On the same day Brother Linville was baptized which still lingers in my mind because he had to be lowered into the water on a stretcher. Sister Liza had been in failing health for a long time but
        as long as she was able she faithfully filled her seat in the church. I feel that both Brother Linville and Sister Liza left a great pattern to follow. They have done as commanded when the Bible says, "Let not the children lay up for the parents
        but the parents for the children." According to the life this Sister lived, we feel that our loss is Heaven's gain.</p>

        in July 1921, after which they were devoted to each other. Sister Anna Mae was the mother of nineteen children, eleven of which are still living. Sister Anna Mae died first in her sickness, being very patient as her children took turns waiting
        on her. The children would always sing for her and she told them that she could hear the angels singing the songs of Zion and it was music to her ears. Brother Elza was also very patient in his sickness as he was waited on by his children. He
        had suffered two broken legs in a car accident earlier. His daughter told me she talked with him and he was only waiting on the Lord. Leaving to mourn their passing are eleven children, thirty-eight grandchildren, three great grandchildren and
        four sisters. One brother preceded her in death: Brother Elza leaves one brother, Kendall Bolen, and 2 sisters. Twenty-five grandchildren were left at the time of his death. Their funerals were preached at the Stone Coal Old Regular Baptist Church
        at Garrett, Kentucky. The children fought hard to keep mother and dad with them but now they have gone the way of all the earth. I believe according to the life of Brother Elza and Sister Anna Mae that they are resting from all their labors and
        all their works do follow them. So, to the girls and boys, grandchildren and great grandchildren, if you want to see mother and dad again, you must be born again and make peace with God. David said the child is gone and can't come back to me,

        did all they could for him but he had to go the way of all the earth. He laid out a great pattern to follow. Being an ordained deacon of the church he was for peace and always helped the church in any way he could. He was always willing to help
        his fellowman. I can honestly say from my heart he will be greatly missed by all who knew him. Written by a brother in hope, Elder Ralph Howard</p>

        and cared for him as a mother would her child. Brother Wiley referred to her as mother. He lived a faithful and humble life and was obedient unto death. He often talked of the good Lord and said he had a better home to go to when this life is
        over, and Dixie said he prayed up to the time where he couldn't talk. Brother Wiley had been in ill health for the last several years. He bore his sickness with much patience and was a very humble man and a good patient. His conversation was always
        on the goodness of God. He was a member of the Salisbury Regular Baptist Church and filled his seat faithfully as long as he was able. He was loved by all and will be sadly missed by all. A book wouldn't hold all the good things we could say about
        Brother Wiley. So let us now say, Sleep on Brother Wiley and we will meet you in that beautiful home you so often talked about. For the Bible says Right blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth yea, say the spirit, they may rest
        from their labor and their works do follow them. Think not dear friends that Brother Wiley's labor was in vain. A little sleep, a little slumber, and the folding of the ha :: and the fruit of a laboring man in sweet. My prayers ascend to God for

        a long and fruitful life. She was born March 16, 1893, at Wheelwright, Ky., the fifth child of Marion and Franky Little, her mother died when she was only seven, thus leaving her as a sort of mother to the younger children in the family. It was
        a joy to talk with her only living sister Allie Burke, yesterday, Allie tells of a young girl in her teens, picking up the responsibility of a deceased mother, working in the cornfields, taking in washing and working as a maid. We sometimes forget
        in these affluent times how hard life can be, Liza knew many hard times, but with all this, Allie says Liza had a happy life. Liza was working for Robert Brown in 1912 when she met her husband Newberry Brown, after a three months courtship they
        were married and moved from Wheelwright to what was then Fed., now Hi Hat, Kentucky. On October 21, 1914 their first child was born, they named her Opal, later the marriage was blessed in order of birth, Nannie, Buster, Ellis, Irene, Greta Pauline
        and Joe, she had 24 grandchildren, 35 great grandchildren and 2 great, great grandchildren. Mamaw was a private person, she did not believe in pushing her religion on anyone, but she did live her life in such a way that commanded respect. In this
        day of slick religion we sometimes forget that it is the life we live, not the words we say which will count in the end. in the thirty-two years I've lived I never heard anyone spot her life. She was not perfect; but she was a good woman. Many
        people faced with the same circumstance's Mamaw faced would have been pessimistic. But listen to this testimony she left for her children: Children I have had a hard life, but thanks to God our great King, I'm going to a place where my hard times
        will be over. Be good, do the will of the Lord and meet me in the Glory World, where we'll be happy for evermore. Good-by children, I asked Allie to write this, I told her what to write. Liza Brown's death on Friday evening, July 6, will leave
        a void in our life that cannot be filled. Her long life was an insperation to all of us. Good-bye Mamaw we'll miss you; but its comforting to know we'll see you again. Written by your loving grandson, Morris F. Hayes</p>

        that Tilton is resting around the throne of God. He is waiting for us to come home and live with him. He told Mom and one of his daughters about a week before he died that there wasn't anything between him and his Lord and he was ready to go home.
        Also a few days before his passing he told his Mom and other members of his family that he was alright and ready to go home. Tilton was so lonely after Louise passed away. He told us so many times how awful it was without Louise and you could
        see his lips begin to quiver as he started to cry. Mom and us girls would visit him often during the time he lived after Louise was gone. It saddens our hearts as We think of the way he suffered after her passing but we rejoice to know we have
        a God so good and kind. He can heal all pain and make you new again and we believe he has :done that for Tilton and he is resting now. No more pain and suffering just waiting for us all to come home and live with him and all our loved ones. &nbsp;Written

        neighbor. Just to know her, was to love her. She had a pleasant personality and winsome smile which endeared her to a wide circle of friends and acquaintances. Her love and devotion to her family cannot be measured. She has left a portion of herself
        in each of them, and many other lives have been made riches and fuller because she passed their way. She became a member of the Burning Spring Regular Baptist Church on the fourth Saturday in July, 1975. Now, a seat in this Church has been made
        vacant for God has called His child to her reward. She will be greatly missed by her friends and loved ones, but they will treasure in their hearts everything about her which they cherished most. If it were possible for her to call back a message
        to the ones she leaves behind, no doubt it would be: I am home in heaven, dear ones; oh, so happy and so bright! There is perfect joy and beauty in this everlasting light. All the pain and grief is over, every restless tossing passed, I am now
        at peace forever, safely home in heaven at last. And He came Himself to meet me, in that way so hard to tread; And with Jesus' arm to lean on, could I have one doubt or dread? Then you must not grieve so sorely, for I love you dearly still, Try
        to look beyond earth's shadows, pray to trust the Father's will, There is work still waiting for you, so you must not idly stand, Do it now, while life remaineth - you shall rest in Jesus' land. When that work is all completed, He will gently
        call you Home, Oh, the rapture of that meeting-Oh, the joy to see you come!</p>

        Myrtle was married to Ellis Mitchell who passed away September 14, 1956, and into this union were born five children: Charles E. Mitchell, Ligon, Kentucky, Lum Mitchell, Grethel, Kentucky, Lester F. Mitchell, Ligon, Kentucky, Cleta Caudill, Lincoln
        Park, Michigan and Ralph E. Mitchell, Cincinnati, Ohio. She had four sisters: Mazie May, Hi Hat, Kentucky, Vela Mae Horn, St. Marys, Ohio, Etta Belle Smith, Murray , Kentucky and Gertrude Osborne, Ligon, Kentucky. Two brothers, Curtis McCown,
        Romulus, Michigan and Earnest McCown, deceased. Sister Myrtle joined the Old Regular Baptist Church of Jesus Christ and was baptized in 1951. This is the hardest thing I have ever tried to do is to write an obituary about my sister Myrtle. I can't
        express the words I want to say except that we love you and miss you very much. We know in our hearts that you are at rest with God. She had told me so many times about her experiences with our dear Lord, and I feel in my heart that she is at
        rest. Many months before she died she would call me and say Mazie are you ready to go to church, we would go, but I would look at her and see that she was in pain. She loved going to church so much when she was able. She is sadly missed by all
        her family and friends. Written by her sister Mazie May</p>

        a heart full of sadness, we will attempt to prepare an obituary of our beloved mother, Hattie Jacobs, Mother was born to Clay and Belle Huff on March 7, 1908 and deceased on Wednesday, Sept ember 6, 1978, making her 70 years of age. She was married
        to Canton Jacobs on September 30, 1930, and unto this union were born eleven children. The boys are Levon, Gayland, McArthur and Robert Lee. The girls are Avonelle, Philipie, Joyce, Betty, Genevieve, and Janice. All eleven children still live
        to testify to the goodness of Mother. One sister, Allie Jacobs, and three brothers, Clarence, Marl, and Harold, are left to mourn their sister. Her parents and four brothers, Carl, Lawrence, Earl, and Laurel, have preceded Mother in death. As
        Job said, "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; Blessed be the name of the Lord." God let us share the love of this our mother. He let us reap the harvests of her guidance and care. He allowed us the blessing of keeping her and enjoying
        the warmth of her love, without the sorrow of seeing her bedfast or suffering some intolerable pain. God blessed our mother to be able to spend her last days, the way she enjoyed the mostdoing things for her family. Mother's every worry and concern
        was for the welfare of her family and others. Every time anyone came into the house or upon the porch, she was asking if they wanted anything to eat. She never failed to cook and prepare food for those who might come to visit. No matter how sick
        or tired, her hands would prepare the things which she knew her children would want to eat. She stood on her feet and canned food to give to those of us who had no gardens. Her cabinet was always stocked with crackers or candy for her grandchildren.
        Our mother was one who wanted to be a burden to no one. She'd go without her medicine before she's ask anyone to take the time to take her to the doctor. She was always worried that she would be a burden to any of us and wanted to pay us for any
        thing we did for her; yet she would take nothing for all the food and things she did for us. She'd always just laugh and say, "I just hope its good." or "There's plenty more when you need some." Mother did not belong to any church but she attended
        church faithfully and lived a clean moral life such that the neigh. bors and those who knew her described her as a good woman and many thought that she did belong to the church. "A good woman is better than precious ointment; and the day of death
        than the day of one's birth." (Ecc. 7:1). On the day of Gayland's baptism when he came out of the water, our Mother said, "Lord, help him." We pray that her soul is at Peace and that she will receive a much needed rest. Gayland wants to urge all
        his friends, family, and neighbors to be concerned about the welfare of their souls and to accept the offer of Salvation, if they have not already sought the Lord. Written by her daughter-in-law, Estelean, With the help of the Family.</p>

        away on Wednesday morning at 1:00 a.m., I asked the Lord to let her live and to forgive me for my sins. To John and the boys you can meet her again if you fall out with sin. She left many friends and a family to mourn her loss, how we miss her

        sadness I trust that God will help me to write a few words about a much loved Brother. Bill Francis was one of the humblest Brothers I believe I have ever known. Seemed that he bore his tribulations with a smile and humbleness. We believe the
        written word of God's teaching in Matthew 10:39. We believe the evidence Brother Bill manifested all those years was proven that he loved our Lord Jesus before all the things which pertained to this world. He loved to talk about Jesus and eternal
        life. Elder Bill Francis, the son of Marion and Arlena Francis, was born and raised in Knott County, Kentucky near Carr Creek High School. There is where he began a new life serving our Lord at the age of seventeen, while still in high school.
        This is when he began preaching. I can remember very well at that time he was the youngest minister near about us in the Old Regular Baptist faith who hart received a calling to the ministry of God. He told the great experience he had with God.
        People came far and near -:. hear Brother Bill preach. He continued on in school to Berea College and met his wife Francis. To this union was born four children: a daughter, Betty; and three sons, Bill, Jr., Sam and Sky. Besides his sweet family
        and a loving mother, he left four sisters and three brothers to mourn his loss. He had moved to Arizona several years ago and worked for the City of Phoenix. Brother Bill had the Ancient Regular Baptist Church in Phoenix, Arizona established many
        years ago with the help of others. Brother Virgil Burnett gave the ground to build on. Brother Bill was Moderator. It meant so much to see him coming to visit my wife and me at our place of stay while in Phoenix the times we were there. To me
        he manifested love for the Old Regular Baptist family and it was real. Brother Bill and Brother Virgil Burnett would always come to help me in the churches from Phoenix, Arizona to the state of Washington, 1,600 miles. At times they drove these
        miles, day and night, to make it in time for church. Brother Bill and his wife, Francis, have flown up and back and many times has driven their family up to be with us. I want my Brothers and Sisters to know how much he loved Jesus. Without any
        doubt in my mind, he found that good old way and walked therein until Jesus called him home-Jeremiah 6:16. At the time I was called to his funeral I was very sick with the flu. Nothing else would have kept me from going but sickness because I
        loved him and his family so much. Children let me say this much. You can see Daddy again if you want to if you will fall out with sin and turn to God. God loves you and will answer your prayers. You know I love you all and will pray for God to
        help you to meet Daddy again. Have faith as a mustard seed and he will answer your prayers. I must close and say I have a hope God gave me around 30 years ago that I will be with Brother Bill soon. Written by Elder Corbett Hale</p>
    <p>It is with a sad and lonely heart that I will try to write the obituary of my dear husband William W. Francis. Bill was born October 2, 1918, the son of Marion and Arlena Francis of Carr Creek, Kentucky. Bill and I met at Berea College, Berea, Kentucky
        in 1941. Shortly afterwards he left to serve his country in the Air Force. He was stationed in Kansas, Texas and New Mexico. Bill and I were married June 1, 1943. I followed him while in the service until his discharge at Amarilla, Texas, November
        1945. To our union was born four children - Daphne Elizabeth 1899i, of Austin, Texas, and William W. Francis Jr., Marion Samuel Francis, John S. S. Francis, all of Phoenix, Arizona. Two grandchildren - Michael Lorren and Rianne Lee, of Phoenix,
        Arizona. After Bill left the service he entered The University of Kentucky Law School, receiving his degree in 1951. After practicing law for some time in Berea, Kentucky, we moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Here he worked for the City of Phoenix for
        nineteen years. Bill was well known and loved by all with whom he worked. He was even more loved by his family and mine, those of the church and many, many friends. Bill was an example to his community, family and neighbors. Bill was a member
        of the Old Regular Baptist Church since he was seventeen years old. He deceased this life January 23, 1979. His funeral was preached by Elder Gene Tuttle and the Ancient Old Regular Baptist Church was filled to overflowing with many standing outside.
        Only those who have lost a loved one know how much we miss him. Bill served as Moderator of the Ancient Old Regular Baptist Church in Phoenix since its organization June, 1962. Bill leaves behind his mother, Mrs. Arlena Francis, and a sister,
        Mrs. Ophelia Stewart, both of Lexington, Kentucky; Also a sister, Mrs. Audry Turley of Louisville, Kentucky; Mrs. Daphne Osolnik of Berea, Kentucky; Mrs. Erma Bird of Scottsdale, Arizona. Three brothers: Wallace Francis of Orinda, California;
        Martin Francis of Spokane, Washington and Paul Gene Franics of Phoenix, Arizona. Bill and I have lived in Phoenix for over twenty years and returned to Kentucky nearly every year to visit his family and mine, the Harrison Proffitts of Paint Lick,
        Kentucky, Louisville and Indiana. My family loved Bill as if he were a son. While we were back he attended The Old Regular Baptist Associations whenever he could. Everyone loved Bill and all believe our loss is Heavens gain. Written by his loving
        wife, F. M. Francis</p>

        Sadie Hager I will write an obituary of her son. Odis was born in the home of the late Dewey Hall and Sister Sadie Hall Hager October 31, 1926. Passed from this life to eternity January 31, 1976, making his journey on earth 49 years and 3 months.
        Odis never was a strong man but he did the best he could to work to support his wife and his self as long as he was able. Odis's father died when Odis was a small boy but I feel he had the care and love of a good Christian mother and stepfather.
        Odis was like all the rest of us he grew up to manhood and sinned against God. Therefore when he became sick he saw the need of a Saviour according to what Sister Sadie told me. He prayed with faith and found a remedy for the sins that burdened
        his soul. If I remember correctly she said he wanted to get able to be Baptized but the Lord saw cause to call him from this world of sorrow to a land of Peace and Joy. Odis was married to Lucy Isaac, January 24, 1959 to this union was born no
        children. He is survived by his wife and mother, Sadie Hager. One whole sister, Junita Johnson, Columbus, Ohio, half sister, Ethel Marie Tackett, Melvin, Kentucky, one step sister, Elpha May Peterson of Illinois, step brother, James Russell Hager,
        Dallas, Texas. His stepfather preceded him in death several years ago. I will say to Odis's family tho Odis came to believe in Jesus as the door way in to heaven at the last days of his life. His joy will be as sweet and his crown just as bright
        as if he had served God all the days of his life. I would like to say to all who have not already chosen the good part don't wait until death begins to close in on you to get ready to cross death's river. It is too great a chance to take on your
        precious soul because death can come so quickly. May God Bless each of you is my Prayers Your friend and Brother in Christ Walter Burke</p>

    <p>With the help of the Good Lord I will try to write the obituary of my good friend and Sister in the Lord, Dora Slone. She was born on November 28, 1911 to Sambo and Rhoda Childers Johnson and departed this life on September 1, 1979, making her stay
        on Earth 67 years, 9 months and 3 days. In early life Sister Dora was wed to Harlos Slone and to this union was born 5 children: Leroy of Oakwood, Ohio; Ray of Hindman, Kentucky; Marie Pratt and Florine Hall of Oakwood, Ohio; and Inis Thacker
        of Hazard, Kentucky. She also leaves 1 brother, Miles Johnson of Hammond, Indiana; 1 sister, Delia Caudill of Dundas, Ohio; 7 grandchildren, 1 great grandchild and a host of friends and relatives to mourn her leaving. Sister Dora and her companion
        worked hard all their lives to make an honest living and provide for their children. Not only was she a loving wife and mother, but she was a friend to the whole community. Everyone who knew her knew of her kindness and thoughtfulness. There was
        never anyone who went to Harlos and Dora's home that left hungry. The first thing they would ask was if you had eaten, and would then insist you eat with them. So many times when I knew Sister Dora didn't feel like waiting on herself, she would
        insist on fixing something to eat for a visitor. She was just that kind of person, sacrificing herself for her family and friends. Sister Dora suffered in her last few years, but she bore her illness with patience, trusting in and praising the
        Lord. She didn't complain and she always had a smile ready for anybody who would stop to see her. Many times I have seen her shouting through the church house, praising the Lord and shaking hands with everyone, show. ing them how much she loved
        them. A week before she died, while I was visiting her in the hospital in Ohio, she told me to tell everyone she loved them. We feel that she was born of this great love and it came to her naturally. Both she and Harlos always showed such a great
        love to little children. A few days before she died, Sister Dora told Flo to not look back, but to look forward and up to God, where all our help comes from. She had also expressed a desire for the Good Lord to come on and take her out of her
        suffering, to her eternal home. Sister Dora was fond of pretty flowers, and always had them in her house and yard. But we feel that she is now a rose in God's bouquet-the reward for her long service and faith in the Lord. We could go on and on
        about Sister Dora's kindness and goodness, but her life told it all. We will say to Harlos and the children, she piled up the stones as she passed this way. She has marked the path, and if you will follow in Mother's footsteps, and make her God
        your God, you will meet Mother again some day in Heaven. Written by her brother in hope, C. B. Smith</p>

        request, I will try to write an obituary of a dear brother in the Lord, Elder Leonard Slone. He was born June 13, 1896 and died March 17, 1979, making his stay on earth 82 years, 9 months and 4 days. Brother Leonard Slone was the son of the late
        Mack and Sarah Slone. In early life, he was married to Allie Triplett. Unto this union was born 9 children. Allie and 4 of the children preceded him in death. Three of the children were very little, under six years of age, but Millard was an adult.
        This leaves 5 children from this union still living. They are: Orville Slone, Pippa Passes, Kentucky; Florida Slone of Pippa Passes, Kentucky; Myrtle Slone, Garner, Kentucky; Georgie Smith, Comar, Washington; Dellie Thornsberry of St. Marys, Ohio.
        Later Brother Leonard was married to Parthenia Owens Hall. Unto this union was born 3 children: Clayton Slone of Rome City, Indiana; Canzalia Slone of Willard, Ohio; Lila B. Gibson of Leburn, Kentucky; one step son, Menefee Hall, preceded him
        in death. Brother Leonard leaves to mourn his loss his wife, Parthenia and 8 children and 2 step-sons, Shelby Hall and Arnold Hall of Leburn, Kentucky and 2 brothers Delza Slone and Birchell Slone of Garner, Kentucky and one sister Mary Belle
        Thacker of Leburn, Kentucky; 47 grandchildren and a host of great-grandchildren. Brother Leonard joined the Caney Fork of the Old Regular Baptist Church and was baptized on August 21, 1935. In 1939 an arm was given off Caney Fork Church to establish
        a new church at Hollybush. Brother Leonard was in that arm. Shortly after joining the church, he began to preach and later on he was ordained as a minister. Being qualified to meet the requirements of a bishop, he was chosen by the church as a
        moderator, which he served faithfully for many years. When time came, being not able to look after the care of the church, he began to look for the welfare of the church. In April 1974, he asked A. 0. McKnight if he would be the moderator. McKnight
        and the church agreed. But the church also agreed to retain him as honorary moderator as long as he lived. Elder Leonard fought a good fight and kept the faith and I believe he laid down the cross and picked up the crown and went to a home where
        he will be happy ever more. His life and works will live on here with his loved ones on and on. This is only the beginning of many good things we could say about our worthy Brother. The love for his church, his family and neighbors and little
        children will live on and on. Written by a Brother in hope, Cody Jacobs</p>

        help of the good Lord, I will write an obituary of my good friend and brother in the Lord, Charlie Hall. Charlie was the son of Lee Hall and Florence (Thornsberry) Hall. Charlie was born September 27, 1895 and entered eternal life January 9, 1979,
        making his stay here on earth 83 years, 3 months and 12 days. In the year 1923 he was married to Clarenda Bates and to this union was born ten children: six girls - Dixie Owens, Gertrude Smith, Eliza Sparkman, Virginia Allen, Judy Owens, and Peggy
        Sue Hall; four sons - C. B. Gordon, Tommy and Adrain. Charlie and Clarenda had 55 good years together. Their daughter, Judy, preceded Brother Charlie in death. He leaves his wife, Clarenda, his children, 14 grandchildren, 3 great-grandchildren,
        two sisters Darkie Bates and Alice Maggard, three brothers - Lee, Dock and Jeff, and many friends and relatives to mourn his leaving. Brother Charlie lived an honest life and worked hard as a merchant, farmer and school teacher. After 43 years
        of devoted life to teaching, he retired but he had spent a lot of his life trying to help others have a better life. He substituted teaching as long as he was able. In Charlie's later life he felt the good Lord heard his cries and gave his hand
        to become a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church at Mt. Olive, and he lived a humble life the rest of his days. When any of the brothers and sisters came to visit him at home or in the hospital, he would ask them to sing some of the good old
        songs and hold prayer. He enjoyed them so much. I can see him laying there when we would come in his room, and he would come in his room, and he would look up with the tears running down his cheeks, he would hold up his little feeble hand to shake
        hands and want everybody to know they were welcome. Brother Charlie said he believed with all his heart the Lord had forgiven him and he had a better home after death, and anyone that knew him didn't doubt it one bit. I want to say to all his
        family that now is the time to start to meet Brother Charlie if you haven't already done so. There many good things I could say about Brother Charlie but ire so ,is life said them all. By his good friend and brother in the Lord, C. B. Smith</p>

        making her stay on earth 74 years, 7 months, and 11 days. She was the daughter of the late William Curtis and Ella Compton Johnson. Both preceded her in death. Mother came to Floyd County when she was young. On July 12, 1927, she was united in
        marriage to William Turner and unto this union was born three duaghters: Gertrude Stumbo, Kathryn Youmans of Minnie and Mary Maggard of Drift, Kentucky. She also leaves two step-children that she raised and loved as her own, W. C. (Buster) Turner
        and Euka Hicks both of Minnie. Another stepson Lenville "Bub" Turner preceded her in death, we feel that he is at rest and waiting for his love ones to loin h;m. Buster and Euka prove their love for Mother while she was here with us. Mother leaves
        behind three sisters: Mrs. Laura Johnson, Korea, Kentucky, Mrs. Opal Moore, Mallie, Kentucky and Mrs. Beatrece Francis, Ohio. Mother joined the Old Regular Baptist Church in 1968 and took her membership at the Old Beaver Church. She loved to come
        to Old Beaver as long as she was able. She was sick so long but it seems that Jesus wanted her to fill her seat one more time. Although she could not speak and sing with them she was with her brothers and sisters on Saturday for the last time
        on earth. We are thankful that God gave us such a sweet Angel Mother who left us the greatest blessing on earth, "Love". Her sweet motherly love will never die and will be passed on to her grandchildren and great grandchildren. May we never lose
        sight of the light she hung in the window. Mother was in ill health for many years, however seriously for the past five weeks. She endured her afflection with great patience until the end. Around four o'clock Friday morning at the McDowell Hospital,
        Jesus saw she had suffered enough and said, "Come Home My Child" and she quickly, quietly and peacefully slipped away to the waiting arms of Jesus. Mother leaves to mourn her passing 5 children, 3 sisters and 28 grandchildren, 26 great grandchildren
        and many friends. Jesus picked a beautiful flower when he took our Mother. I could write many good things about her. She has endured many hardships and heartaches here on earth but now she can rest. Her worries and trials are over. Joy will come
        in the morning.</p>

        him only had good things to say about him, Ecclesiates - Chapter 7 and 1st verse: A good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death is better than the day of one's birth. I would like to go to the Pslam of David 116th chapter,
        15th verse, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints". I would like to say to Uncle Miles' children, you are living in the land of the dying and if you fail to make peace with God and be born again, I feel that where your
        dad has gone you cannot go, I believe with all my heart that one day I will walk with Uncle miles before God in the land of the living. Written by a heart broken nephew and a brother in the Lord, Bro. Bal Williams</p>

        of his son Green Bud Mosley, I will try to write a short obituary of my dear beloved father-in-law to wit Edd Mosley aged 99 years and 8 days old. He was born April 26, 1879. Departed this life May 4, 1978. He was the son of Nathaniel and Polly
        Mosley. His grandparents on his fathers side were John and Rebecca Mosley. He was married to Julie Gayheart in 1898, and to this union were born 13 children. His wife and six of his children preceded him in death, leaving seven children still
        living: Bailey Mosley and Lucy Moore of East McDowell, Ky.; Green Bud Mosley, Minnie, Ky,; Polly Howell of McDowell , Ky.; Dick Mosley of Dwale, Ky.; Emma Hammonds of Ivel, Ky.; Armina Hall of Drift, Ky. He joined the Regular Baptist Church some
        fifty years ago, and lived a faithful member until death. He always loved to go to church as long as he could go, and no matter how cold or how bad the weather was he would go day or night to preach for the sick or over the dead. His mind was
        so good he could quote the scripture word by word, and sing songs he knew by heart three days before his death. He always loved to set and talk on the Bible, and what a good home the Lord has for all of them that would love and serve Him, and
        how bad it would be for them that ,Hasn't prepared, to have to go to a place where they would burn for ever and ever and never die. He often told me that he was praying that all of his children would turn and live for the Lord before it was too
        late. I can say I believe with all my heart that his soul is at res waiting for that Great Judgement Day when he can go home with his good wife and little children to be happy forever more. I have been with him, in his family for over 49 years,
        and I can say I was always good to him, and his wife was like my own mother, we always got along good. Written by his daughter-in-law, Awkie Mosley</p>

        the daughter of the late William Newsom and Matilda Hamilton Newsom. She was married to William Bartley in October, 1913. Unto this union were born 5 children. Her husband preceded her in death in July 1950. She also had 1 son, Clemit Bartley,
        to precede her in death. Those left to mourn her passing are her 4 children: Amos Bartley of Penny, Ky., Bertha Tackett of Millard, Ky., Cecil Bartley of Virgie, Ky., and Oma Hamilton of Virgie, Ky. One step-son, Levi Bartley of Virgie, Ky. Also
        16 grandchildren, 32 great grandchildren, and 1 great, great grandchild. Sister Beckie joined the Old Regular Baptist Church in July 1944 and was baptized at the hands of Elder John B. Hamilton and Elder Sollie Kiser. She was a faithful member
        to go to church and so many times we have seen her shout the praises of God. About three years before she died, she was taken sick and was not able to go to church, but she would want the brethren to sing and pray beside her bed. She was in the
        arm that established the Bethlehem Church in the year of 1960. Her membership was still there when she passed away. We realize that she is gone and cannot come back, but by the grace of God, we can see her again. She was such a good companion
        and mother; we miss her so much, but we feel her soul is resting under the altar of God; waiting for that great and notable day of the Lord when He will come back and change these vile bodies and fashion them like unto His most glorious body and
        take us home to reign with Him in heaven through the ceaseless ages of eternity. We could write so many good things about her, but space won't permit, but best of all she lived a good christian life and left a good light for her children to follow.

Brother Vent and Sister Ann were members of Rose of Sharon Regular Baptist Church in Lincoln
        County, Kentucky at the time of their death. They were faithful members, attendin every time they were able. We feel when they could not be ther their hearts and prayers were with us. Their memory lingers on in the hearts of their childrer brothers
        and sisters, and many friends. They both had Compare ions and children who preceded them in death earlier in life. The married and were devoted and happy together for the last sever years of their life. They both have children. I can't remember
        a their names. Children if you want to see Mother and Daddy again, yo must fall out with sin and be born again by praying to the same God Mother and Daddy prayed to. Brother Vent and Sister An were the most humble and friendly people you could
        ever meet They were always happy when people came to see them an especially loved to have church in their home. I never will forget Sister Ann would want us to sing, "I Want to Live So I'll B Ready". At the end she would say, "Won't we all be
        happ there, if we are lucky enough to get there." I believe with all my heart they reached that home the so speaks about. I could write a book of the goodness of both c them, but the life they lived before the world was enough t prove it all.

    <p><strong>EARL CAUDILL</strong> In loving memory I will try to write an obituary for our father, Earl Caudill, who passed away from this earth on April 13, 1977-two years ago. Daddy left behind him the loving memories of the wonderful father that he
        was. He worked hard all his life for his family. His health would not always permit him to do all the things he wanted to do, but he did the best he could and gave us children the best of everything that he was able to give us. Daddy was born
        in Pike County on May 27, 1911. He was married to Minnie Sawyers, Caudill on October 13, 1932. To this marriage was born 5 children, 2 of which preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Minnie Caudill, 2 sons; Lester Caudill, of Hopewell,
        Virginia, and Allard Caudill, of Chester, Virginia. e is also survived by one daughter; Mrs. Pal Mira Caudill also of opewell, Virginia, whom our mother lives with. He has left 7 grandchildren, 2 step-grandsons, and 3 great-grandchildren. He rleft
        4 brothers; Granvel Caudill of Fairborn, Ohio, Jessie h ester, and John Caudill all 3 of Waynesburg, Kentucky. One sister; Mrs. Pearlie Shea, of Kings Mountain, Kentucky. Dad and Mother lived most of their married life in Lincoln County, Kentucky.
        Daddy joined the Little Powell Old Regular Baptist Church when I was a child and was Deacon of the church when he died. I feel like Daddy tried hard to live a good life in front of us children and would want us children to live a good Christian
        life too. So I hope with Gods help we will all be ready to have a better home when it comes our time to go. Written in Loving Memory for our Mother and all his family by his daughter: Mrs. Pal Mira Caudill</p>

    <p>It is with a sad heart that I attempt to write this joint obituary of my dear deceased mother and father. My mother having passed away in 1972 and never having an obituary printed I thought it appro- priate to make this a joint one. Melvina Newsom
        was born on the 17th of June 1892 and departed this life October the 16th 1972. Making her stay on this earth 80 years (plus). She married Charley Mosley on May the twenty-fourth, 1911. Unto this union were born three sons, Clyde Mosley Weeksbury,
        Kentucky, Valis Mosley, Seamen, Ohio, and Kinnel Mosley, Wheelwright, Kentucky. In addition to the children they also left to mourn them 13 grandchildren and 23 great grandchildren plus 10 step great grandchildren. Mother joined the Old Regular
        Baptist Church some fifty years ago, and was baptized by Elder Hiram Hall. Her membership remained with the Old Beaver Church till God saw fit to call her away. She remained a faithful and dedicated member until death. Charley Mosley was born
        May 25, 1888 and departed this life the sixteenth of August 1979. Making his stay on this earth ninty one years and fifty seven days. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church the 16th of May 1979. It was a shock to most people when he joined.
        He had lived such a life that most people believed he was already a member. I am sure that all who knew him would agree that he never held a grudge against any one, and was always a jolly person. I can remember him quoting a scripture found in
        the book of Job, ch. 14 and 14 and 15 verses. "If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come. Thou will call and I will answer thee". They are now resting and awaiting on that sweet call.
        We all miss them so much and hope to meet them again in a better world where there will be no more suffering and pain. God bless all is my prayer. A son in Christ. Kinnel Mosley</p>

He was an inspiration and a true friend to all who knew him. This obituary will be quite hard for a little person, like myself to write. Daddy was the
        son of the late Sherman and Sarah Francis Browning Hatfield. Sarah Francis died when Daddy was only seven years old. This truly was a hardship for him. On March 5, 1921, Daddy married the former Stella May Browning. This union was blessed with
        twelve children: Marie Bosley of Costa Mesa, California; Opal Thomas of Gallipolis, Ohio; Tracy Jr. of Forrest Hills, Kentucky; Ruth Wells of Sacramento, California; Julian of Anaheim, California; Rachael Henderson of Conley, Georgia; Ralph (deceased
        in 1964); Chester of Forrest Hills, Kentucky; Hayes of Hampden, West Virginia; Patty Taylor of Hampden, West Virginia; Patsy (deceased in 1943); and Bennett of Conley, Georgia. In 1933, daddy felt another need in his life. He traveled for about
        six months before he felt the Lord had forgiven him for his sins. He said he was going up the mountain (walking) and he told the Lord he would kneel and pray when he got the top of the rnountain. He said when he came to himself, he was several
        miles down on the other side of that hill. He said everything was different; the trees were more beautiful and the birds sang prettier. That was when he felt the Lord had forgiven him. His experience was different about the Regular Baptist. He
        had never heard of them. He walked miles to different kinds of churches but was never satisfied. He had heard of a meeting (Regular Baptist) at a little school house about fifteen miles from his home. He walked and said he was only there a few
        minutes when he felt the same spirit that had saved his soul. So, the third Sunday in August 1933-Mom and Dad were added to the Rosa Regular Baptist Church. When Daddy came out of the water (after baptism) he came preaching. Daddy was ordained
        in March of 1934. He went to church when he wasn't able and he had to leave Mom unattended when she was sick. He went because he promised the Lord he would do whatever he wanted him to, if he would just save his soul. I feel he kept his promise
        to the end. He went to church the first Sunday in June, that was his last time. Daddy got sick on June 6, 1979. He had been sick for several years, but he wasn't able to do much from June 6th. on Friday, July 13, about 1:00 p.m. he died. He just
        went to sleep. Daddy lived a good life, but he had a hard life too. He fought a good fight, he stood firm in what he believed in. He loved Mother and us children, but he never let us stand between him and his Lord. I feel sure Daddy will be missed
        by all who knew him. I also believe our loss is heavens gain. I must say I hated to see him go, but I am also happy in my heart because I feel after forty six years of labor, Daddy got his pay day on July 13, 1979. I hope he can be remembered
        by all the churches. May God add his richest blessings to each of you. His unworthy daughter. Patty Taylor</p>

        8, 1916 and unto this union was born 7 boys. His first wife Mary Ann died Setpember 8, 1929 and when Dad died he had 3 surviving sons by his first marriage. On January 31, 1931, Willie was married to Elizabeth Hamilton and unto this union was
        born 8 children, 7 of these children survived him in death, he also had a step daughter by this marriage, he had 28 grandchildren and 20 great grandchildren, he has 4 sisters still living. We will all mourn his loss forever, he was a precious
        Dad, he was known by a lot of people and never talked of any enemies. While he was in the hospital, he never gave up hope of getting better so he could return home with us, at times we could hear him mumbling a prayer asking God to open up his
        heart and let him pray for those he loved and let them pray for him. He loved his friends and neighbors and before he died, he said he loved all of his children and he wanted all of us to love each other. Dad never joined the church but you could

        So I want to say to Andy her dear companion, I know you have looked for Stella many times since she has been gone. She can't come back to you, but by the Grace of God you can pray on and try to meet her around that beautiful throne. So I want
        to say to her children, I know the old home place isn't the same since Mom has gone. Mom can't come back to you, but by the Grace of God you can join Mom when this life is over. The Old Samaria Church has lost a wonderful member but I feel and
        believe she is gone on. to Heaven where we all want to go. She was good, to everyone both saints and sinners. I went to see her two weeks before she died. I enjoyed talking with her. She was talking about her children and grandchildren. We thank
        the Good Lord for taking her so easy. She died sitting in her chair. I could go on writing good things about her but her life proved what a good woman she was. So I want to say to the children, obey mother's good advice she always gave you, and
        you won't never go wrong. I feel and believe I will be with Sister Stella some day in that beautiful country where we will never grow old. So children be good to Dad and try to meet Mom when this life is over. Written by a sister in hope who loved

        Lucy A. Hall: On November 3, 1923 the dreaded angel of death broke into the community at McDowell, Kentucky and took from the care and embraces of five sons and five daughters a loving mother. No sadder task could not be assigned me than to write
        a brief sketch of her life. But to recall the motherly, Christian life that she lived and the hope and longing that she often expressed for that heavenly home should be sufficient to remove all sadness, and cause our hearts to rejoice. Lucy Hall,
        nee Hopkins, was born August 1, 1857. Besides her children and grandchildren she is survived by two sisters and five brothers, two of whom, John Hopkins and Thomas Hopkins are Baptist Preachers, and well known throughout the churches of the New
        Salem and adjoining Associations. She joined the Regular Baptist Church at Joppa in September, 1892, living as a faithful member until her death. She was married November 27, 1873 to B. F. Hall, who passed from this life October 21, 1901, leaving
        her with eight children at home principally under her care and support, for whom she labored earnestly and willingly. While her efforts and long years of toil were rewarded with the satisfaction of seeing her children pass to respectable manhood
        and womanhood and have homes of their own, yet her greatest desire was not accomplished. Tchildren, which was found written upon the pages of a book at the home of her daughter, with whom she was living at the time, and which within itself is
        a good obituary. Her children were: E.V., W.J., John, O.C., Thomas, Evelyn, Florence, Rosie, Birdie and Bertha. Dear Children: Will write you a few lines to let you know I am still living, but am in bad health, just can sit up and walk about the
        house, but I am glad the case is as well with me as it is. Did not expect to be living this long, but am yet here, not knowing how long I will be with you but hope you will all do well and prepare for a home in Heaven. It is better than all the
        world. It's where we never will part, can always stay together and never be parted anymore. I feel glad to get to go to such a home as that. I don't claim any home here. Would be glad to go anytime. Written by Lucy Hall This, the 8th day of December,
        1920 "Thought I would write some more. This is from the heart, is not of this world. I never could talk to you as I wish to and as I ought to, but have lost many nights sleep praying for you when you were all asleep." I am glad to say though it
        be with tearful eyes, that she lived to witness with much rejoicing the confession and baptism of the writer, and who of us can't say that she to-day would not rejoice even more at the confession of a wicked son or daughter. During her life she
        was blessed with fairly good health until on August 17, 1919 when her physical activities were suddenly stilled by a dreadful stroke of paralysis, compelling her to live thereafter as an invalid among her children, all of whom administered to
        her freely and willingly. Children, many times have we been called from a distance to "come at once, mother's condition is serious." Now we have had our last earthly call to come to mother's bedside, but in her own language as printed above, there
        is a call, a message from mother, and I pray God that her message may sink deep into our hearts and cause us to so live that when the final call may come for us that mother's hopes may be fulfilled, her prayers answered, and her sleepless nights
        rewarded, as she with praising and rejoicing that she had an interest in her children beyond and above the things of this life is shown by the following letter to her</p>
    <p>joins that convoy of angels to carry our souls to that Heavenly home where there is no paralysis and where God himself is the light. Written July, 1924 by E.V. Hall</p>

        born November 29, 1897 at Hueysville, Kentucky to the union of Marion Manford Allen and Arizona Click Allen. Dad departed this life February 25, 1979 making his stay on earth 81 years, 3 months and 26 days. On April 21, 1921 Dad took in marriage
        Sarah Jane Hyden; to this union were born 4 children: Edgel Allen of Anaheim, California, Juanita Hawkins of Sydney, Ohio, Agnes VanHoose of Langley, Kentucky and William Manford Allen of Langley, Kentucky. All the children: 9 grandchildren and
        13 great grandchildren, are left to mourn Dads passing. Mom and Dad had a marriage of 58 years. Dad was more to us children: He was a friend, counselor, and confidant. The love Dad had for all children was self evident when they were with him;
        especially his grandchildren. I have never known any person that has more love and compassion than did Dad. Dad was preceded in death by his father and mother; four sisters: Hattie Prater, Lona Prater, Artie Hicks and Amy Greene. Two brothers
        also preceded Dad in death: Luther Allen and George Allen. One sister: Daisy Patton survives. Although crippled by the loss of one leg at the age of 18 ears Dad never minded hard work; he did some odd jobs but mainly about 13 years in the coal
        mines and 29 years for Kentucky West Virginia Gas Company from which he retired in 1963. In 1975 Dad had a stroke and never fully recovered from the effects of it. In the last two years of life Dad was an invalid and had to be cared for night
        and day. I n those last agonizing months Dad was attended by Mom and daughter; Agnes Vanhoose. believe God will look pleasingly at Agnes for her devotion and love for both Dad and Mom. We believe that Dad made peace with God before he left this
        life. We live and hope with the promise of the Saviour knowing He is merciful and promises in Matthew 11-28, "Come to me ye that labour and are heavy laden I will give you rest." We hope and pray that Dad is resting, Dad by his own testimony and
        his action when he heard the prayers, songs and preaching of the ministers and friends who visited him in his home. We know for a certainty that Dad prayed for forgiveness and we believe God hears all prayers that go to Him in faith and humility.
        Dad was an Old Regular Baptist at heart and attended the church for many years, and continued to attend as long as his health permitted. Although Dad never joined the church He felt the love and fellowship with all. The singing and preaching made
        a good impression on Dad. God bless you one and all. I believe that one is never gone unless they are forgotten therefore Dad is with us. As Dad's nephew, Leonard Gibson wrote on Dads passing: The gentle words of our merciful and forgiving Saviour,
        "Fear not little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom." With a prayer of thanksgiving to God for the time He allowed Dad to stay with us. We now live and hope that on judgement day we can all be together. We can
        if we have repented and been washed by the blood of the Lamb. On that day we can see our loved ones in the house of God where all have been made whole and perfect. Written by his son, Edgel Allen</p>

        with a sad and lonesome heart that I write the obituary of my dear mother, Mary B. Smith. She was the daughter of John and Emily Moore Newsom, born on October 21, 1882, and deceased December 16, 1978, at the age of 96 years, one month and 25 days.
        She was a member of the Old Beaver Regular Baptist Church most of her adult life. She didn't get to attend as much as she would have liked to because of distance and health sometimes. On August 22, 1900, she was married to Cullen B. Smith, of
        Knott County, and nine children were born of this union. Preceding her in death was her husband, Cullen on March 13, 1968, and three children, Tolby in 1936, Verda Cornett in 1960, and Kermit in 1966. She is survived by two sons and four daughters,
        Homer B. Smith of Dade City, Fla.; Cullen B. Smith, Jr. of Winchester, Ky.; Elizabeth Marvin of Paris, Ky.; Ruby Johnson, Emily B. Smith, and Inez Wilson, all of Lexington, Ky. She had 16 grandchildren, 23 great grandchildren and five great great
        grandchildren. One brother, William Cullen Newsom, of Bradley, W. Va. also survives. She lies at rest in the Evergreen Memory Garden between Lexington and Paris, Ky. Twenty-two years ago my sister Emily and I returned to our parents home to take
        care of them after they could no longer make a living on the farm. We tried to do everything possible to make their lives more comfortable and happy while they were here with us. They both were always able to do for themselves up until the day
        they passed away. The angels came quietly and took them away as they slept. I used to think about one day writing a poem about my mother, but then, I thought, why wait, why not write it now so Mom could know how I felt about her. On her 95th birthday
        I presented her with the following poem, which tells of the kind of woman she was. I would like to share, with you, the poem I wrote for her. Written by Inez Wilson (For Her Mother Mary B. Smith's 95th Birthday-October 21, 1977)</p>

    <p><strong>MARY JANE COLEMAN <a href="images/../public_html/ORB_Photos/1979/mary_jane_coleman_ORB.jpg"><img src="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1979/mary_jane_coleman_ORB_small.jpg" alt="mary_jane_coleman_ORB.jpg (22204 bytes)" width="67" height="53"></a></strong>        I will attempt to write the obituary of Sister Mary Jane Coleman, who departed this life on September 4, 1979. She was born June 2, 1889 in Pike County, Kentucky, and was the daughter of the late Jim and Elizza Adkins Stephens. She was married
        to John Coleman, who deceased in December, 1944. She is survived by two brothers: Jeff Adkins, of Ashland, Kentucky, and Wallace Adkins of Fort Gay, W. Va., and one sister: Fannie Bevins, of Meta, Kentucky, several nieces and nephews. She was
        a member of The Regular Baptist Church of Jesus Christ for many years. All of us who were so close to Aunt Mary will miss her so much. We especially thank God for Aunt Mary's sister, Fannie, and all her family who were so close to her. I know
        God will bless all of you for what you did for my Aunt and dear sister in the Lord. We are thankful for everyone who helped in her last years here on earth. Sister Mary had lived alone for many years. God always has a way of paying people who
        do good deeds. It was always a blessing for me to get to talk to Aunt Mary. She was a model Christian, and bore the mark of Jesus and surely must have had His spirit, which will quickin her mortal body like His most glorious body when He calls
        for us all to be with Him. In closing, we can thank God for such a precious loved one, and I am sure God will let her live on in our hearts till we meet again, and if we truly believe in Jesus, we will live again. Written by Grover Adkins</p>
