<font size="2">Elder Earl Howard was the son of the late Brison and Nancy

Howard. He was born Feb�ruary 22, 1890, and departed this life February 23,

1964, making his stay on earth seventy - four years and one day. In early life,

he was wed to Emma Reed who departed this life July 17, 1958. Then in the second

choice, he was wed to Essie Gayheart in whom he had a very happy marriage in the

last days of his stay on earth. He had been sick with hardened arteries for the

last three years, but he bore his sickness without complaint and continued to

visit churches and serve God. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church about

forty- nine years ago. Through the church, he is known to the community as a

wonderful minister and friend. Brother Earl Howard was a man that devoted his

life to serving the Lord by building church houses, attending funerals, and

serving as the moderator of churches. He was the moderator of Bails Branch

Church when he died. He has served this church faithfully for many years. He had

helped with the building of eight church houses, and we shall certainly miss him

in the circle. He was the father of ten children, five boys and five girls.

Mother and two of the boys, Elder Raymond Howard, and Isadore Howard, preceded

him in death. That leaves eight children to mourn his loss: Norman Howard, Dema,

Ken�tucky; Burton Howard, Mousie, Kentucky; James Dullard Howard, Martin,

Kentucky; Mrs. Eldred Allen, Fairborn, Ohio; Mrs. Imogene Morris, Clarksville,

Indiana; Mrs. Allene Sammons, Franklin, Ohio; Mrs. Goldie Stewart, Cleveland,

Ohio; and Mrs. Donnie Sue Brown, Dayton, Ohio. He also leaves thirty-one

grandchildren, fifteen great grandchildren, one brother Melvin Howard, a large

host of kindred and friends. We have a lot to be thankful for. With the four

that have passed away, they have all left a wonderful hope. So to those that are

left, let me say, we know not what hour the death angel is coming around again

and which one he will call for. So be ye always ready, for you know not the hour

the death angel will caM for you, and the main thing is to be prepared. Let me

say to the children, relatives and friends that are left, farewell, Elder Earl

Howard has just beat us to tl~e happy home. He has died in the Lord and is

resting from his labors. To his wife, let me say, if you want to live where your

husband has gone, prepare to meet God in this life.&nbsp;<br>

Written by his son, Elder Burton Howard<br>

A memorial will be preached the third in October at Ball Branch Church.</font></p>

<p><b>ISTIAMEL GIBSON</b>&nbsp; <a href="images/../public_html/ORB_Photos/1964/ishamel-gibson.jpg"><img border="2" src="../../public_html/ORB_Photos/1964/ishamel-gibson_small.jpg" alt="ishamel-gibson.jpg (11971 bytes)" width="68" height="61"></a>

<font size="2">Brother Ishamel Gibson was born August 15, 1913 and de�parted

this life March 25, 1964. He was the son of Miles Sr. and Lucy Bradley Gibson.

He was married to Viola Huff, December 23, 1932 and to this union was born 3

children. One boy and two girls, Gerald Clark Gibson, Charlene Gibson, and Carol

Faye Gibson. He joined the Old Regular Baptist Church and was baptized by Elder

Bert Howard and Elder Coy Combs on the third Sunday in November of 1954 and took

his fellowship in the Ball Branch Church and re�mained there 7 years. He then

moved his letter to the Steels Creek Church where he remained until his death.

He was the assistant clerk of the Church. He was faithful to fill his seat as

long as he was able to come and was a strong defender of the old time way and

faith. He leaves to mourn his earthly loss his mother and good wife and children

and brothers and sisters who stood by him until the end; also, a great host of

brothers and sis�ters of the Old Regular Baptist Church and many friends, but I

feel down deep in my heart our earthly loss has been his heavenly gain. He said

during his illness, �If he should be permitted to live a thousand years he

would be no more ready to go than now.� He feared no man and he followed no

man; God alone knew his heart. He said he didn�t fear death, but desired not

to linger and suffer so long. So dear children if you want to go where I believe

Broth�er Isharnels soul has gone and where Sister Viola has hopes of going you

will have to serve the same God they have while you live here on this earth.

Ministers he requested in his funeral were Brother Bert Howard, Brother Ellis

Hopkins, Brother Troy Nickels, and Brother Green Bradley.&nbsp;</font></p>

<font size="2">The obituary of B. T. Thomas, the son of James and Sarah Thomas

born October 28, 1963, being 86 years and two days old. He was wed to Manda

Collins in 1906. In early life to this union was born 10 children. Two preceded

him in death, leaving eight still living. Brother T, as we always called him,

joined the Old Regular Church about 42 years ago in which he lived a fruitful

life, one in which his children and his neighbors would do well to take heed of

his life. He. was a Deacon of the Old Ball Fork Church. The church has lost a

good pillar, a member and the community has lost a good neighbor. He leaves to

mourn his passing his wife, Manda, and eight children, sixty grand children and

thirty-nine great grand children. Brother T was loved by practically all men who

knew him. We will not say all because the Bible says �Woe be unto the man

everybody speaks well of,� but as a neighbor, he couldn�t be beat for he had

the respect of everybody. We certainly feel that our loss is Heaven�s gain.

When he was dying Sister Manda said he patted her hand and smiled and fell

asleep. So to his children especially to those who have not made peace with God,

if you ever want to see Daddy again, make peace with God while life and

opportunity affords. We have to prepare in this life if we ever see how the

Glory World looks.</font></p>

approximately 15 years ago and was loved by all who knew him and he was whole heartily

devoted to his family and all neighborhood children. Always showed great love

and admiration for everyone. He was badly afflicted for many years and bore his

sickness with patience. We have no doubt that according to his testimony and the

life he lived but that he has passed out of this life to a life of peace and

happiness with his loved ones gone on before. The family wishes to thank all his

friends and neighbors for their help and concern during his sickness and

death.&nbsp;</font></p>

lived so humble a life and I say to his wife and children if they ever want to

see him again, they will have to be born again. So may God bless them and that

they never will forget the good preaching he always preach to them. So I feel I

dear sweet Mother who is gone but not forgotten. She was born May 11, 1866 and

departed this life April 9, 1960. She was a member of the Caney Fork Church for

forty years. She loved her church and was a faithful member as long as she was

able to go. She was so humble and kind to everyone. I can remember when I was

growing up, people would pass by and she would go out to the road and ask them

to come in and eat with her. She would say �I have it on the table, come and

eat with me.� She loved to see anybody come to visit her. Oh, how we miss her

no tongue can tell. She visited my home about a year before she went away. She

said, �I want to see where you live before I go away.� I am living in hopes

that I will see her again when this life is over.&nbsp;</font></p>

<font size="2">With a saddened heart, I will try to write the obituary of my

father and mother. Father has been gone for 26 years. I want their obituary

written together. John Owens was the son of Vencon and Lucinda Owens. He was

born June 18, 1878 and died June 9, 1985. He was 57 years, 11 months, and 21

days old. He was afflicted with that dreadful disease T. B. He suffered severely

for 18 months. He said he was just waiting for God�s time. Just a short time

before he died he said, �0 Lord, haven�t I suffered long enough to go home?,

take me on.� He seemed to suffer but little more. Helen was the daughter of

Tandy and Ann Slone. She was born August 29, 1878 and died November 23, 1961.

Mother was afflicted with hardened arteries. She was so humble and bore her

sickness with patience. She was sick for sometime. They were married in the year

of 1892. Unto this union was born fifteen children, 6 boys and 9 girls. They

joined he Old Regular Baptist Church about the year of 1911. They were faithful

members as long as they were able to go. They served the church as deacons for

several years. They showed great interest in the church as long as they lived.

They prayed for their children and gave us good advice. The good council of our

mother and father is still living in our hearts today. The family is almost

gone. Six children are left to mourn their loss. They are: Alva Owens, Hindman,

Kentucky; Kennel Owens, Lackey, Kentucky; Edward Owens, Garner, Ky.; Ethel

making his stay on earth seventy-five. years, eight months, and five. days. In

early life, he was wed to Sister Emma Hays. To this union was born four children

to wit: Ezra Turner and Trimble Turner, both of Wayland, Kentucky; Hatler

Turner, Dema, Kentucky; and Zeda Turner, at&nbsp; home. Morg Turner has been a

life long resident of Wayland. He was a good neighbor and will be badly missed

grandchildren, J o h n Morgan T u r n e r, Tennessee, and Joe Turner, Tennessee;

two great- grandchildren, one brother, Buck Morris, and one niece, Bill Turner�s

wife and a host of friends and relatives to mourn his loss. Brother H a w 1 e y

Warrens asked Morg just before he left for the hospital that in case he did not

come home, how the case was with him. Morg told Brother Hawley that there was

nothing in his way; he was alright and ready to meet God. We of the Regular

Baptist will certainly miss him in the old church, because he was more faithful

than some of the members in filling his seat. The good Lord was mighty good to

his family. Morg was the first one to go out of the family. However, let me say

to the children; if you want to see Daddy again, you will have to come to God

and repent and be born again. To Sister Emma, the time won�t permit us to wait

too long before you see Brother Morg again. Jesus says in Revelations,. �Blessed

are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth says the spirit they may rest

from their labors and their works do follow them.� Let me say that the best

word was for Morg to say that there was nothing in his way.&nbsp;</font></p>

born May 5, 1894 and departed this life July 19, 1964. He was seventy years, two

months and a few days old at the time the death angel made its visit to his

home. Johnnie, to his neighbors lived a good life. H~ had belonged to the Old

Regular Baptist Church, of which he was a deacon, about twenty-six years. lie

was wed to Wanna Hall in the year of 1914 and to this union was born eight

children, one preceding him in death. Two boys, Herald, Lackey, Kentucky, and

James, Dayton, Ohio; Mrs. Ada Martin, Dayton, Ohio; Zelda Tuttle, Topmost,

Kentucky; Noe Slone, Lackey, Kentucky. Brother Johnnie became sick and went to

the hospital for an operation and received a shot in the spine which para�lyzed

his whole body. lie bore illS sickness with patience and Sister Wanna must have

been blessed because she waited on him day and night standing over him

continually. There was a love between them that could o n I y be separated by

death. We believe according to his life among his children and his neighbors,

that Brother Johnnie has just left a world of trouble and now is resting from

all his labors. He leaves to mourn his passing, forty grandchildren, thir�teen

great-grandchildren, his wife, three brothers, James Hall, Cold Grove, Ohio;

George Hall, Bevensville, Kentucky; and Willie Hall, Bevensville, Kentucky; one

sister, Anna Slone, Faulton, Ohio; a large host of kindred and friends. To the

children that have not made peace with God, Brother Johnnie has passed from this

world to a never ending eternity and I am sure he would like for his children to

follow him, but if you don�t repent, I do not believe you will ever see your

daddy again. He left this world telling his com�panion he just wanted to go

home and was not afraid to die and face God. A memorial will be preached the

a great friend in time of sickness. She was a Mid-wife and was always ready to

minister to the sick and ready to lend a help�ing hand, but now she is gone to

enjoy that happy home that Jesus said he would go and prepare for his children.

A few words to Sister Nora�s children - you should be so glad of those sweet

words she said while dying - �I am going Home�. Alaf air, I feel you will

meet mother again some day, and Harmon, you and Herbert can too, if you haven�t

<font size="2">While sitting here alone, if the Lord will give me the mind and

strength, I will try to write a short sketch of the life of my loving husband,

Berry Tackett. He was the son of Andy and Hannah Tackett. He was born April 29,

1910. He died April 28, 1964, liked one day being 54 years old when sweet Jesus

sent and took him home to live with his daddy that left him in 1949. He was

first married to Elvie Hamilton in July 1928. To this union was born 6 children,

4 daughters and 2 sons. His companion and one daughter preceded him in death.

Then he was married the second time to Mahala Tackett in July, 1942. Unto this

union was born 3 children, 2 sons and 1 daughter, which the Lord loved our baby

better than we did and took it when it was only 3 weeks old. So I be�lieve that

Berry is resting with the rest of the family that God has taken away from us. He

leaves a lonesome wife, 3 girls, 4 boys, a sweet mother and 23 grandchildren,

also a host of friends to mourn with us. Berry loved every body. While he was in

the hospital he had so m a n y visitors, the nurses said he had more friends

than anybody. Berry didn�t belong to the church, but he loved the Baptist

family. We always went to church. We loved to go to church. It Was for a while

before Berry took sick that he worked so hard that he wanted to stay at home and

rest. But still he would talk about not going to church. He told me and his

mother not long before he died that he would like for the good Lord to let him

live long enough to tell the people what he had done for him. He said with his

sweet trembling voice that he had a better home to go to. He told his mother

that him and her was standing on a little platform and a ladder to it and one of

the others had to climb that ladder. So I feel like that sweet Jesus sent one of

his Angels to climb the ladder with him. He loved his family so much that he

wanted them to stay around him where he could see them at all times. He would

say it done him good for any of us to have our hands on him. He had so much

faith he wanted some of the good people to stay with him so they could put their

hands.. on him and try on him. Seems like it would give him ease. He enjoyed

people coming in and talking with him. Old brother Jerry Hall and some of the

other good people stayed Sunday and Monday night with him. Jerry got up at mid

night and started home. He looked up at Jerry and said with a very weak voice,

Jerry if you leave me I, will be dead before daylight. So Jerry stayed with him.

He hated to leave his his family so bad on Monday night before he died he called

all his children and talked to them he told them he was going to Heaven and for

them not to put it off to late to live right. I was standing at his back with my

hands on his head he looked up at me and said to me, my sweet wife will you meet

me in Heaven? I told him yes I don�t feel like there is anything in between me

and my Lord and I believe me and Berry will live together again. We did

everything that we could do for him. All the children were good to stay and did

every thing that their daddy wanted them to do. I stood by him and held to his

hand just as long as I could stand it. It was hard to do but I knew that was

With a sad and lonely heart I will try to write an obituary of our b e 1 o v e d

mother and grandmother Darcus Gayheart for mama and their other children. She

was born June 16, 1877, and departed this life September 25, 1962. She was

married to Richard Gayheart (deceased) in 1892. To this union was born five

children, three boys and two girls, Millie Hall, Lum Gayheart, Melda I-JaIl,

Milford Gayheart. and Granny joined the Old Regular Bobby Gayheart, deceased.

Baptist Church in September of 19~7. She loved to go to church so much. She

believed in filling her seat as long as she was able to get there. She was

afflicted for several years before she died. She loved all her brethren and

sisters so much and would send for them to come and preach and sing for her.

Seems like she would get so happy. I have seen her unable to get over the floor

by herself and some of us would hold her up while she shouted and praised the

Lord. She was a firm believer in the old time doctrine. She told me so many

wonderful things. One thing she told me so many times that she didn�t believe

Brother Troy would tell the church any�thing wrong. She talked to her children

many times and beg�ged them to fall out with sin and live for the Lord.

Children if you want to see mother again be ready to meet her when the Lord

comes again. Milford remember how often mother talked to you and begged you to

live for the Lord. Get ready to meet her. She told us so many times she didn�t

mind dying that she was going to a better home. Granny loved all her good

friends so much. Sadly missed by her children and grand�children.&nbsp;<br>

Brother Bert Conn was here on Saturday before he died on Sunday morning. He was

talking with him and when he started to leave he told Brother Bert he wanted him

to come back and have church for him and he died on Sunday morning between the

We feel that some day we will all be together again where we won�t have to

says blessed and holy is he that has a part in the first resurrection for on

departed this life August 13, 1963; making his stay on earth 80 years, 4 months,

joined the church to told his wife he wanted to talk to her ond she asked him

what he wanted and he said I am not satisfied this way, I want to have Church

here at home. We asked him when he wanted Church and he said next Saturday. So

we had a called meeting here at home and he joined the Church. He had been sick

for a long time with heart disease. Papa was always good to everybody and he

always wanted everybody to come and eat with him. He would give the poor and

needy the last dollar he had. We were broken hearted to see him depart from us,

but mortal man cannot stop the hand of death or the will of God, when he reaches

forth his long and fruitful life, a long stop over here on earth in a earthly

home. And it is not for his soul that we weep but for the belief that when he

passed beyond this realm of pain and suffering he entered the door of God�s

eternal kingdom. He told his daughter not many weeks before he passed away that

he was ready to die, that there was nothing in his way. His two daughters and

wife have professed a hope in Christ. We miss Papa very much, his place at home

In remembrance of my lov�ing Mother and Father, I will try in my weakness to

write in regard to my Mother and Fath�er�s life. My Mother, Mrs. Sallie Scott

Griffith was born September 21, 1888 and departed this life November 25, 1962

being 74 years and a few days old. Mother was the daughter of Dan Scott and

Sarah Hoover Scott of Garrett, Kentucky. My Father, Harrison Grif�fith was born

May 29, 1884 and departed this life April 20, 1964. Dad was the son of Jim

Griffith and Betty Hicks Griffith of West Virginia at Big Creek. Dad and Mother

were married early in life and to this union ten children were born of which

four proceeded Dad and Mother in death. The remaining children are Richard

Griffith of Tekonsha, Michigan, Sol Griffith of Garrett, Kentucky, Mrs. Sarah

Price, Rushville, Indiana, Mrs. Sadie Mink, Indianapolis, Indiana, Mrs. Dolly

Hunter and Mrs. Harvey, both of Dema, Kentucky. Mother and Dad were both members

of the Old Time Regular Baptist Church at Stone Coal and served the Lord

faithful some forty five years until their death. Mother and Dad was loved by

all who knew them and I can say with great confidence that their doors were

always open to the people of God. Ican remember Mother coming to the old church

at Stone Coal and shout the praises of God as soon as she entered the church

door. The many friends that knew Mother had great confidence in her and often

they would come to their little home on Stone Coal and have Mother to pray for

them and try on them that her great faith in the creator would help to relieve

their suffering. To the children that remain to walk this life, I want all of

you to follow in the foot steps and after the same example �left you by Dad

and Mother. I believe with my whole heart that Mother and Dad has left a world

of suffering and gone on to receive their crown of glory which the Lord promised

to every one who would love and serve him. Dad and Mother were both poor people

and could not leave us any wealth but I had much rather have the con�fidence

that Mother and Dad are resting in the hands of sweet Jesus, than to have

inherited a mansion from them. Dear children remember the many good things that

Mother and Dad taught us when we were around the old fire place at home. I am

sure that you want to see them again and my advice to each of you if you haven�t

made your peace calling and election sure with God ... I beg to each of you

close in to the offered mercies of God and let all of us be united together

around God�s great throne with the one who gave his life for us all ... Ye

must be born again...&nbsp;</font></p>

She leaves three boys, one step son, and five girls. Children, I know you will

much in this world. I do hope you will make the choice mother made. ~ She came

By request of the family, I will attempt to write a short sketch of the life and

death of a beloved brother in the Lord. Brother Marion Slone was born November

11, 1891, the son of Adam (Ad) and Tena Slone. On July 12, 1912, he was united

in marriage to Rosetta Short, and to this union was born eight children; four

boys and four girls. One boy preceded him in death, leaving seven 3hildren, a

great number of grandchildren, a dear compan�ion, and a multitude of friends to

mourn his passing. Brother Marion joined the Mount Olive Church of Old Regular

Baptist the first Sat�urday in April, 1961, and I feel that he lived a good Christian

life until his death. He bore the fruits of love and charity within the church

and among his neighbors. It gave him great pleasure for his brothers and sisters

of the church to come in his home and hold services for him. He seemed to take a

special delight in feeding the congregation, and was not satisfied until

everyone had eaten. On November 11, on his 72nd birthday, he was stricken down

with a stroke, and was never able to speak again. A few days later he was taken

to Mount Mary�s Hospital, Hazard, Ky. On the Sunday before he died, I, (the

writer) went to visit him. When I went in, he was lying with his eyes closed,

and it looked as if he could not live long. I asked the family if they thought

he recognized anyone; they said they did not. I was very much grieved because I

wanted him to know that I was there. With a heavy heart I walked out in the hail

and began to ask God if it was his will He would let Brother Marion understand

that I was there. Then I went back inside, stooped over the bed and said �Brother

Marion,� he did not seem to notice, so I spoke again, �Brother Marion, open

your eyes and see if you know me.� As soon as I had spoken, he opened his

eyes, cast them upon me, and his lips began to tremble. He raised up his arm as

if to embrace me. This makes me believe that God answered my prayers and let him

realize that I was there. On November 27, 1963, the terrible monster, death,

entered the hospital and took Brother Marion away. Though his family, friends,

and the church greatly miss his presence among us, we rest in hope that he

gained that haven of rest beyond this vale of tears. I would like to say to his

children: Children, your Daddy prayed for you when you were gone from home, He

begged God to let you return safely. Children, if you could only see the things

that are prepared for your Daddy and all that loves and serves the Lord, you

would try to be better boys and girls and meet your Papa in a better

world.&nbsp;</font></p>

By request of the family, I will try to write a short sketch of the life of a

dear brother in the Lord. Brother G. J. �Bud� Slone was born Feb.11, 1883,

the son of Billie and Martha Slone, and departed this life Oct. 13, 1963. In the

year of 1902 he was united in marriage to Hannah Elizabeth Slone, and to this

union was born seven children: Canton of Lexington, Ky. Cephas, Emmitt, and

Hulda of Pippa Passes, Ky., Bertha of St. Marys, Ohio and Dora of Wauseon, Ohio;

one girl, Tina, died in infancy. Brother Bud�s companion, also, answered the

summons of death, and in the year of 1920, he was married to Elizabeth� Slone;

they had one son, Berlin Slone of Pippa Passes, Ky. So, Brother Bud leaves seven

children, 25 grandchildren, 45 great grandchildren, 2 great- great-grandchildren

and a dear companion to mourn his pass�ing. In 1939 Brother Bud joined the

Mount Olive Church of Old Regular Baptist. He preached for. several years, but

was never ordained for the ministry. He was ordained as a deacon, and fulfilled

the qual�ifications in a conscientious and upright manner. He at�tended church

as long as he was able, and was faithful to visit the sick. I have seen him many

times tottering along the road on his cane, to visit some sick neighbor, and I

have honestly thought that the person he was going to see was more able to visit

than he was. Brother Bud, like all good Christians, received some criticisms,

but he would say, �It is not what people say about you that counts, it is what

God knows about you. While they�re talking about me, they�re letting

somebody else alone�. Finally the terrible grip of cancer was fastened upon

the frail body of Brother Bud, and he was stricken down to bed, but he continued

to plead and counsel young and old to seek for a better life. I believe one of

the greatest tributes to Brother Bud was the confidence and respect shown to him

by the younger people. After he got beyond speaking they would come in and gaze

sorrowfully down at him as if to acknowledge that they were losing a dear

friend. There are many wonderful things I could say about Brother Bud, but space

will not permit, so I will conclude this obituary by saying to his family: I

know that you miss your Daddy, and nothing will ever be the same as it was when

he was with you, but try to comfort yourself with the hope which he left you. I

firmly believe that in his dying moment, he viewed his eternal happiness; the

refuge of the weary pilgrim. If any of you are still out in sin, let me be~ you

to get ready to walk with Brother Bud in that shining city where separation

cannot come and heartaches are no more. </font></p>

write a sketch of my precious grandson, one so dear and near to me. Jimmy Wayne

was born April 23, 1946, died Sept. 7, 1963 at the age of 17 years. He was the

son of Ezra and Doris Martin. He had one sister and one brother. The best of all

he left us a good testimony he wasn�t afraid to die. He was baptized into The

First Baptist Church at an early age about 14 years old. He was involved in a

Motor Cycle accident. He told them he was going to die to tell his Mother, and

take him to the hospital and just give him something to relieve him and let him

go on. He asked them to pray for him and he prayed with them. He told his Mother

and others just a short time before he wasn�t afraid to die, he wouldn�t

care to go on, that this was a wicked old world to live in so much trouble. The

life he lived and the way he talked, we don�t worry about his soul, only the

great loss. He was the flower of our home. It is so hard on us to give him up. I

can see now what Wayne meant when he said I hate to leave you here, you have so

much trouble. Wayne had only been gone seven months when Jimmy Wayne left us. I

have dreamed of seeing them together looking so happy and smiling. I feel, they

are together. I get home sick to go to heaven I want to go and see them. I have

so much trouble and hardships here. I want to say to Ezra and Doris just press

on, Jimmy is gone never to return any more in our home buy&nbsp; by the grace of

God we can go to him to never have to part no more.</font> </p>

With sadness and a broken heart I will try to write an obituary of my sweet and

be- 1 o v e d companion, Virginia Elouise Sandefur Stratton. She was born

September 4, 1920 and departed this life July 1, 1964. She was the daughter of

James L. and Henrietta Pauley Sandefur. She was married to John George Stratton

January 22, 1944 and to this union were born 8 daughters: Gladys Irene, Wanda

Sue, Rita Gay, Neitha, Loretta, Sandra, Lenetta, and Kay which are all at home.

She has six brothers: Robert Sandefur, Sidney, Kentucky; James L. Sandefur,

Jr. Portsmouth, Virginia; Carmen Sandefur, Norfolk, Virginia; Melville Sandefur,

Portsmouth, Virginia; T/Sgt. Winifred Sandefur, Air Force Homestead, Florida,

and Henry Sandefur, Portsmouth, Virginia. Three sisters: Mrs. Susie Chapman,

Ferndale, Michigan; Miss Roberta Sandefur, Forest Hills, Kentucky, and Mrs. Ruby

Mozis, Hopkins, Minnesota, and her mother and father James L. and Henrietta

Sandefur who reside at Sidney, Kentucky. Elouise joined the Old Regular Baptist

Church March 9, 1947, and was a faithful member to attend church as long as she

was able. The good life she lived at home, in the church, before her neighbors

and the world I believe proved that she was born again, and that in the hour and

article of death that she just went to sleep in the arms of Jesus. If it could

have been God�s will I wanted her to stay with me and the children a little

longer and I prayed to this end, but Jesus seen cause to call her home to Glory.

So Friends, Neighbors, and children remember the life that Elouise lived, and

when Christ visits you and bids you to accept Him as your personal Savior don�t

turn him away. So pray that God�s will be done and may He prosper and Bless

the Old Regular Baptist Church. </font></p>

my heart but I believe if he ever sees mother again he will have to repent and

look to the same God that mother looked to and I sure hope that he will do so

before it is too late. Mother loved him so much and she told me after she got,

bad off if she didn�t never get to talk to him any more for me to tell him to

meet her in a better world and she didn�t never get to see him but I believe

if he will be a good boy and repent he can live with mother where they will be

happy together and I feel deep down in this sole of mine I will see mother again

in a place where we will be happy and won�t have to part no more, but I get

lonesome in my home thinking of mother. I waited on her so long, but I believe

the good Lord held me up to wait on my little poor sweet mother. She would say

to me so many times God bless you, Lona and I believe that come from her heart

eyes, but I believe some day they will be wiped away. The other children�s~

while here on earth. She was not wise in her own conceit, but lived an unselfish

life and close to God. She was tolerant of people who did not look, think, act,

and believe as she did and was able to accept those people for the fine

qualities they possessed. Doria did not like self-pity, for it destroys fine

character; she had a true love for humanity in her heart and was always doing

things for others. Jesus says, �Fear Not.� and that was the way she lived.

She would not allow fear to come in, but surrendered it to God. She did not show

an inner strain or a lack of confidence and poise. Doria had faith which gave

her power, love, cheerfulness, compassion, friendliness, gen�erosity,

tolerance, and justice. She seemed to use herself as a �measuring rule� to

find out the dimensions of those with whom she came in contact. She thought

human sight was never clear enough to justify in passing judgment; for we can

be well pleased with his fellow�ship and when his brother and sisters came to

see him, he would rejoice. I can truthfully say that he was always a good friend

of mine as well as all of his other brothers and sisters. Brother Lee worked

hard for his family as long as he was able and he was always pleased when people

came to see him. Now children and mother, daddy is gone and he cannot come to

you, but by the grace of God you can meet him someday. I love brother Lee�s

family because they were all so good to him, and someday I hope they will meet

him in a better world. I am sure they can do this because the good Lord never

turns any one away that comes to him in faith. I feel that our church has lost a

good member and I a good friend. I have a hope that someday I can meet him in a

better world beyond this one here below. There no nature ~n ever enter and all

will be peace, joy, and love, and all will be of one mind. Brother Lee�s

Memorial will be preached on Buckingham Cemetery the third Saturday and Sunday

in July of 1965, by Johnie Jones, Oliver Meade, Joe Burkes, Robert Bates, Walter

Burkes, and Trip Hall.&nbsp;</font></p>

words to express the loss of a loving mother, Liza Robinson Hoover. She was born

Dec. 17, 1900, she diel Feb. 26, 1963 making her stay on earth 62 years, 2

months, and 9 days. She was the daughter of Newt and Betty Robinson� She was

married to Granville Hoover in 1917, to this union was born 11 children, 4

preceded her in death, leaving 6 sons and 1 daughter and husband to mourn her

loss. Her Sons are Ray and Clyde of LaGrange, Ohio; Lester and Elmer of Wayne,

Michigan; Willie at Garret, KY.; and Jackie home with their Dad, and one

daughter, Mrs. Delbert Castle of Wayland, Ky. A host of grandchildren and

friends and neighbors, three sisters and one brother to mourn her loss. Mom~

joined the Old Stonecoal Church of Regular Baptist at Garret, Ky. May 2, 1949

and was baptized by Bro. Earl Howard. Mom was sick and afflicted for many years,

her condition was such that she couldn�t fill her seat as often as she desired

to, but she loved to hear the gospel preached in its sweetness and power, which

caused her to rejoice in the God of her salvation, giving praises and glory unto

the one who had washed her soul in His blood and made her an heir of God and

joint heir with Jesus. When I would go home for a visit mom would ask me to sing

and hold prayer and she would be so happy, that the tears would fall from her

face as she clapped her hands and praised God, she would say, �How happy I

would be if I could have all of my children to walk with me�. The last letter

I got from mom she was in the hospital waiting to be operated on. She said, �Ray

I feel my way is clear with the good Lord. Eleven days later they called us mom

was gone. God had seen that mom has suffered enough in this world of sorrow and

troubles, and had called her home to rest from all her toils. No more to know

the sorrows of this earth. Not long before Mom had to go into the hospital, she

was unable to leave home, being left alone while the family was away, her sister

went to see about her and she said, �Kate I have shouted all over the yard

today. Mom is re�joicing, in the presence of her King now, no more to be parted

from his joy. So I feel to say to the rest of the family, if you ever expect to

see mom again, you have to serve the same God mom did. She bowed humbley to his

will and guidiance and so you will have to do the same. I expect to see Mom

again soon, for I have the sweet witness in my soul that Mom�s Shepherd is

mine also. Daddy don�t wait too long, you are nearing the end of your stay

here on earth, make preparation if you expect to see mom again. I hope the

family circle will not be unbroken. I trust by the Grace of God the rest of the

family will accept God�s call and be ready when death comes.&nbsp;</font></p>

the daughter of the late Lee Hall and Flourance Thornsberry. Rean was born

December 14, 1888, departed this life September 20, 1963, making her stay on

earth 74 years, 9 months, and 6 days. She was united in marriage to Elder Jerry

Campbell November 30, 1931, and they seemed to live a well-devoted life

together. Rean had been sick for a long time with sugar diabetes and high blood

and in much pain. She was always kind to everyone. I visited with them several

times and she told me the hardest thing that she now had to contend with was the

diet the doctor had her on and not being able to help Brother Jerry with the

work. The last week of Rean�s life was in the Lady of the Way Hospital in

Martin, Kentucky and she prayed all the time. Two days before she died, she said

she saw her father and mother and brother and sister coming to take her home..

Rean had never joined the Church but she always held up for the Old Regular

Baptist so we believe from the testimony she left that in the resurrection

morning her body will come from the grave and reunite with the soul and then go

home to sing and praise the Lord forever and forever.&nbsp;</font></p>

his loss. He bore his sickness with great pride. He had a stroke the 3th day of

October and was taken to the hospital but nothing could be done for him. We

stood by him and did all we could for him but Jesus loved him best. He wanted to

be baptized that was all his talk so he joined the Regular Baptist Church the

16th of October 1963. He was baptized by J. L. Hamilton, Butler Howell, Miford

Adams, and Bill Martin. He was baptized in a sheet when we brought him back home

he didn�t want us to change his clothes. He said they felt so cool to him and

seemed like he felt so much better. So on the 18th of October, 1963 Jesus called

him home to punish no more. He was buried the 20th of October on the Noah

Newsome Cemetery. He had 7 great-grandchildren, 48 grandchildren. I could write

lots more but time won�t permit.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2"><b><u>DAVID FAIR SLONE</u></b> With much

sadness, by request of the family, I will try to write an obituary of a dear

uncle, Fair Slone. He was the son of Elder Morgan and Susanna Slone. The best we

can figure he was born July 22, 1886 and deceased this life November 19, 1963,

being a little over 77 years old. He was married to Carrie Draughn and unto this

union was born 13 children, 11 living and two dead. He had 22 grand�children

and 9 great-grandchildren. Fair joined the Ivy Point Church of the Old Regular

Baptist Sept. 1960 and was baptized by Elder Cephas Mosley and Sam Johnson.

After Fair joined the church, he wondered why he had stayed out of the church so

long, feeling the Lord had forgiven him years ago. That Spirit of God had bided

him to come home so many times, not realizing the many Blessings he was being

robbed by his disobedience. But God was merciful unto him and let him live a few

years in the church, in God�s kingdom here on earth, where there is food for

the children of God. Fair has left many good memories of his life. He piled up

some stones, he left some foot-steps for the children to follow in, in that path

of the good old way, it will lead them to that Eternal Home, whose maker is God.

The Lord was ever his conversation, that was all he wanted to talk about. He

would get so happy talking on the Bible, just like he was preaching to you.

Those that have been born again, their treasures are on high. The last time I

visited Fair, we sat in front of the fire, there in his home, and he was talking

about praying for his children. He said, �As long as I live I will never stop

praying for them, no never, he said it won�t do to give up, for prayer unlock

Heaven�s Door�. He was so worried afraid they would put it off too late. No

doubt there has been many hours he and Carrie have sit there alone and cried

over their children, as well as the many hours they sung songs and talked of the

Lord. I believe Fair has gone where trouble sickness, sorrow can not come, where

there will be no heart attacks, to call the children home in sadness. But there

is a voice calling to them, that they can go meet Daddy, if they will repent of

their sins, where there will be no separation. Those that hasn�t repented,

children repent now before it�s too late and while Mother is still with you to

see your Christian life. Oh! how happy she would be. One thing, I myself am,

thankful for, that Fair didn�t have to lay and suffer week after week, he was

up and around his home, God seen fit to call him home, he went in just a moment

of time. So I believe he has just crossed over Jordan and entered into that

long-waited for peace and joy, where Carrie will soon go to meet him. No doubt

he has said many times, �how long dear Savior, how long? will it be till I can

come and live with you. I am looking for that day when I can say �Farewell

vain world I�m going home, I feel having a witness I will meet him again in a

re�union of God�s children, where be no goodbyes. The last thing he said to

me, was if he never again was permitted to meet me here on earth, he felt we

would meet on High. How happy his soul must be today. So children, get ready to

meet Daddy, prepare yourself to live after deaths Mother is here, sow the

flowers now for her, while she is still with you, don�t wait till after death,

your flowers to her will be repenting of your sins, telling her you are going

home with her. May God Bless and comfort Carrie with that Spirit from on high,

in her lonely hours, may he be near her, May God Bless each one of the children.

May we meet in that Eternal home.&nbsp;</font></p>
