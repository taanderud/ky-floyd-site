    <p>&nbsp;===================================================================</p>
    <p><strong>RALEIGH SHEPHERD</strong>: By request of the family , I write the obituary of Raleigh Shepherd, the son of Wilson Shepherd and... Margaret Vanderpool Shepherd, both being deceased. He was born May 30, 1903 and deceased this natural life December
        21, 1988 at home. During his... lifetime he lived in Magoffin County, Gunlock, Kentucky. On March 18, 1926 Raleigh was united in marriage to Virgie Hale, who survives. Unto this union were born seventeen children. Daughter Maxine being deceased.
        Nine boys and seven girls survive, namely: Gertrude Pattee of Wabash, Indiana Ethel Vanderpool of Gunlock, Kentucky; Eugene Shepherd of Greenwich, Ohio; Kenneth Shepherd of Claypool, Indiana; Joyce Hale of Ypsilanti, Michigan; John Clayton Shepherd
        of Gunlock, Kentucky; Jewel Dean Joseph of Aler, Ohio.... Buell Shepherd of Germany; Edward Lee Shepherd of Pierceton, Indiana; Kermit Shepherd of Wabash, Indiana Paul- ine Schrader of Plymouth, Ohio; James Gordon Shepherd of Lansing, Michigan;
        Haskel Shepherd of Garrett, Kentucky; Wanda Faye Bailey of Garrett, Kentucky; Janet Gay Conley of East Point, Kentucky and Raleigh Shepherd Jr of Pikeville, Kentucky. There are forthy-five grandchildren surviving and twenty-threre great-grandchildren.
        Raleigh and Virgie were honored to have six sons to serve their country: Kenneth, John Clayton, Buell, Edward Lee, Haskell and James Gordon. One sister survives, Emily Conley of Lackey, Kentucky. Deceased sisters are: Sis Hale, Rebecca Bailey,
        and Darcus Vanderpool. Many relatives and friends are left behind, too... numerous ro mention in this obituary. Raleigh retired several years ago from Inland Gas Comp- any of Ashland, Kentucky, having the position of gas well field operator. Raleigh
        and his good, companion had to work hard to bring up as large a family as their, but God prospered them to do so, I believe. Raleigh was always a quite, soft-spoken man who seemed to get along with all his fellow men. He with the help of his good
        companion, was blessed to rear a large, honest and respectable family, teaching them to be so. Raleigh has been afflicted for several years, but God permitted him to live a long life. He did not have membership in any church here on earth, but
        it gave me great satisfaction to hear he... told Brother Crisp that he was saved. His companion said she could hear him praying at night. My mind goes back to the past and reminds me just how fast the aged friends, who were the foundation of our
        surrounding area in which we live, are passing on into eternity. I pray to God that the younger generations will continue and remember what a great county we have had and that they will strive to per- serve that. The only way in which to do so
        is to put God first. To the children and relatives, which is such a large number together at this time. I admonish you (if you have not made peace with God,) I would beg you to do while life and opportunity affords you, and travel as a Christian
        with your good mother, who has been serving God for many years. Written by Brother Monroe Vanderpool.</p>

    <p><strong>FLORA DELILAH CLICK LITTLE</strong>: It is with great honor and privilege, yet mingled with much sadness, that I write this obituary of my grandmother Flora Delilah Click Little. She was born June 14, 1905 at Lee City in Wolf County. She was
        the daughter of the late John P. and Martha Jane Riley.... Click. She spent her childhood days on the banks of the Old Tog River. These early years proved to be the happiest of her life. Grandma moved to Weeksbury, Kentucky as a teenage girl with
        her mother. At the age of fourteen, she was united in marriage with my grandfather Lish Little at Melvin, Kentucky July 27, 1919 by Brother Harm Hall, an Old Regular Baptist Minister. This marriage was blessed with sixteen children. Grandma was
        preceded in death by her husband of Sixty- four years, Lish Little. She was also preceded in death by four children Clifford, Naomi Ruth, Ronald Lee, and Raymond; several grandchildren four sisters and two brothers. Left behind to mourn her passing
        are thirteen children. Sons: Claude, Jesse and Claude Preston all of Weeksbury, Kentucky, Merle Little of Prestonsburg, Kentucky, daughters: Lossie Hall and Pat Branham of Weeksbury, Kentucky, Peggy Sue Holbrook of Melvin, Kentucky, Rene Mae Taylor
        of Neon, Kentucky, Martha Anderson, Leota Barnette, Mary Ann Ridout, Carol Endicott, all of Columbus, Ohio, and Betty Jo Bostic of Charleston, West Virginia. Also left to mourn her passing are forty-two grandchildren; forty-six great-grandchildren
        and eight great-great-grandchildren; two half-brothers: Teddy and Rufus: two half-sisters Maggie and Dolly, all of Hazard, Kentucky and a great host of friends. Our family has not been complete since God called grand- pa away August 8, 1983, but
        we did still have grandma. But since God has seen fit to call her home April 10, 1989, our family will never be the same. I know that my grandmother's prayer was that one day all her family would get their lives right with God so that one day
        we could all be united in heaven as an eternal family, where we'll never have to say goodbye. Written by: grandson, Terry Franklin Bostic.</p>

    <p><strong>GEORGE HOLBROOK</strong>. It is with an aching heart but so many precious memories that we will attempt to write the obituary of a kind, loving father and faithful and devoted husband to wit George Holbrook. Daddy was born September 24, 1937
        to the late Noah and Healtha Hudson Holbrook of Pike County. He left this earth September 30, 1988 at his residence at Melvin, Kentucky at the age of 51 years six days. Dad met and married our mom Peggy Sue Little Holbrook, November 21, 1959.
        One of the joyous times in dad's life was the birth of his four daughters: Yvonne Carol Holbrook Bryant of Wheelwright, Kentucky, Daddy gave Yvonne away in marriage to Billy Gene Bryant. Dad thought of Billy as the son he never had; he knew he
        could depend on him when- ever he needed him. Daddy was very pleased at the birth of his two granddaughters; Jaclyn and Amanda Rene Bryant. He got so much pleasure out of seeing them play and grow. He would sit and watch them swim for hours. He
        took such an interest in them that their little hearts are broken at the loss of their Ps Paw. Daddy also leaves behind two brothers and two sisters; Clifford Holbrook of Varney, Kentucky, Sidney Holbrook of Nashville, Tennessee, Billie Williamson
        of Varney and Jennifer Geunin of Alexandria, Virginia. He loved his brothers and sisters and spoke of them often. Daddy was raised in these mountains he called home until he was drawn by his love for the sea to join the U.S. Navy at the age of
        seventeen. Dad really enjoyed serving his country for twenty-two years. He did it so well and with a great deal of pride. Daddy was... really gifted with leadership abilities, which enabled him to receive many honors and medals, some of which....
        were National Defense, European Occupation, Good Conduct Madeals, Good Conduct Awards, American Expedition, twice, Vietnam Service Medals, Vietnam Campaign Award and Action Combat Ribbons. Daddy often said he missed the sea; the smell of salt
        water, the calmness he felt with himself when there was nothing but clear sky and still, blue water. Although Daddy didn't return to the ocean, even with all of it's serenity, we feel as if there is no comparison to the peacefulness he now sees.
        Dad encountered his frist heart-attack in June of 1976, which forced him to retire in October of the same year. Daddy was baptized June 7, 1980 by Elder Charlie Jones and Elder Jimmy W. Hall. Dad spent many hours of work and pleasure at the Joppa
        Church. He wanted the church to grow and prosper. He tried to do what he could for the upbuild of Joppa Church. We could write so many things about Daddy but we know that those that knew him knew the kind of man he was. He was always ready and
        willing to help those who needed it. We truly feel that the family and community has suffered a great loss. Although Daddy is gone from our home, he could never be taken from our hearts. Our lives will never be the same. Death took Daddy from
        us but Jesus Christ shall give him life. Written by: his broken-hearted family.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;===================================================================</p>
    <p><strong>CLAUDETTE BROWN</strong>: It is with a feeling of sadness and great loss I will attempt to write this obituary of our loving mother, Claudette Brown. Mom was born February 14, 1934 and passed away June 5, 1989 makeing her stay upon this earth
        55 years six months and five days..... She was the daughter of Evan Hicks and Alice Chaffins Hicks. Mom was married to Jack Brown May 24, 1951 and she was a loving wife for thirty-eight years. To this union were born six children. She leaves to
        mourn her death her husband two sons; Sherman Brown of St. Mary's Ohio and Harold Brown of Mousie, Kentucky. She also leaves three daughters; Melouvan Trysinger of St. Mary's, Ohio; Naomi Brown of Mousie, Kentucky; and Eileen Mullins of Hueysville,
        Kentucky. Her fourth daughter Jackquline Ruth is deceased. She also leaves behind eleven grandchildren and two step-grandchildren. With a heavy heart I will try to write a few words about Mom. She was a good and loving mother; was always there
        for us children, whenever we needed her, in good times as well as bad. Even though we miss her every day of our lives, we know that no one will miss her like Dad. We can no longer see Mom, but she is still with us in our hearts. A mother like
        ours is more than a memory; she'll always be a living presence. Mom was a member of the Old Regular Baptist. Her member- ship was at Garrett Stone Coal Church. She was a faithful member. We know that Mom has gone to heaven and is at rest with
        a cheesy smile and a wave of her hand. Mommy wandered into the promised land. Written by: a heartbroken family.</p>
    <p>===================================================================</p>
    <p><strong>BOSS SLONE JR.</strong>: I will try to write an obituary of Boss Slone Jr. Boss was born April 14, 1927 and deceased this life March 24, 1989, making his stay here on earth 61 years three hundred and forty days. Boss Slone Jr was the son of
        the late Green and Rhoda Slone, who pre- ceded him in death. Early in life he was married to Zona Huff. Unto this union were born five children; four sons and one daughter. Left to mourn his passing are: his wife Zona Slone four sons Manuel Slone
        of Hindman, Kentucky; Michael Slone of Pippa Passes , Kentucky; Daniel Slone of Indiana, Samuel Slone of Indiana; a daughter Katherine Shepard of Indiana; also six grand-... children are left to mourn his passing. Also left to mourn hie passing
        are four brothers: Austin Slone of Pippa Passes, Kentucky; Conard Slone of Ravenna. Ohio; John L. Slone of Ligoner, Indiana; Austin Slone Jr of Garner, Kentucky; five sisters, Merkie Slone of Pippa Passes, Kentucky, Tina Slone, also of Pippa Passes,
        Dovie Maggard of Ligoner, Indiana, Imogene Huff of Hebron, Indiana, one sister... Linda Slone preceded him in death. Also left to mourn his passing are a host of friends and relatives. Boss worked to raise his children and was liked by all who
        knew him. This is very sad for me to try to write this obituary of my brother-in-law. He was always good to me and to all who... came to visit him. Boss was a retired coal miner and was sick for over a year before he passed away. From what I heard
        he was... praying before he died and told some how he love the Lord and was in his hands. I hope he fell asleep in the arms of Jesus. I had the privilege to work in the mines with Boss for a few years and I enjoyed working with him. I want to
        say to all his children, friends and relatives, if you haven't already fallen out with sin and fallen into the mercies of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who came down here and died for all mankind, and rose from His tomb and a few days after
        He ascended back to the Father and is sitting on His right hand making intercession for them that loves and serves Him. He told us before he ascended back to His Father I will go away but I will come again to receive them unto myself... that who
        has loved and served me, Jesus said you must be born again. I will close this obituary by saying may our great God of heaven bless all as he has already so many times. Written by: a sad and broken-hearted brother-in-law Lee Maggard.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;==================================================================</p>
    <p><strong>BROTHER RUIE COLEMAN</strong>: This is an obituary of a good man that made a little community called Greasy Creek, his home for eighty years. April 17, 1934, Brother Ruie Coleman married Sister Annie Charles and to this union were born ten
        children. One son Johnny, preceded him in death. That leaves to mourn his death his wife Sister Annie Coleman of Greasy Creek, Ken- tucky; five daughters Connie Bently of Flint, Michigan, Sylvia Meace of Lombard, Illinois; Mae Clearcy Sandera

        Coleman of Barberton, Ohio, God also blessed Brother Ruie and sister Annie with teenty-five grandchildren and fifteen great-grandchildren. God blessed Brother Ruie and Sister Annie with a wonderful family and a happy life and in the twilight of
        his life God bless- ed Brother Ruie to be baptized into the old Regular Baptist... Church. On Saturday, October 29, 1988, Brother Ruie was baptized by Elder Ked Adkins and Elder Clarence Bowersock in the Fishtrap Dam. Brother Ruie and Sister Annie
        both took membership at the Chloe Creek, Old Regular Baptist Church. Written by: Elder Ked Adkins, with help of the family.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;===================================================================</p>
    <p><strong>DAVID RAY THACKER</strong>: By the help of God I will try to write the obituary of my son David Ray. He was born August 31, 1965 to the late James R. Thacker and Faye Keene Thacker. He passed this life on June 12, 1989 making his stay on earth
        23 years nine months and.... twelve days. His dad preceded him in death December 30, 1982. He leaves his mom one brother Johnny, and one sister Hala to mourn his death; also eight uncles their wifes five aunts their husbands and one grandmother,
        Dollie Hunt Thacker. I love my son he was a special rose when he was born. My heart has been broken since God took him away, but God needed another rose for his bouquet. God called and David answered. To his friends, cousins and all the young
        people David would say "Get ready to answer that call for it's coming to us all sometime in life. David served four years in the U.S. Navy. He spent three months at home with me. The last two months David lived, he started going to church and
        I feel he made a change. He told his uncle Ted Robinson that he didn't want to be the man he once was, but wanted to be a better man. I do believe he was on praying grounds when he left this world. He told a friend when he went into church it
        would be the Old Regular Baptist Church where his mom belongs. I feel David made peace with God before he left this world. It seemed he was warned of his death by the things he would say sometimes when he was talking. I hope my loss is heaven's
        gain. My home will never be the same. It is so lonesome since my son and husband have gone away, but by the grace of God, I hope I will meet them again some day in that land where we will part no more. Witten by: his broken-hearted mother, Faye
        Thacker

    <p>===================================================================</p>
    <p><strong>OMA KATHERINE GRIFFITH</strong>: I will try to express the thoughts and feeling, the heaviness of heart, the sweet memories, and the tears of the family of Oma Griffith, if God will allow in the name of sweet Jesus. Oma Katherine (Conley)
        Griffith, 70 of 13753 N. Drive st. Tekonsha, died Wednesday, September 21, 1988, at home after a lengthy illness. She was born in Morgan County, Kentucky and came to Tekonsha in 1954. She attended the Little Polly Church of Jesus... Christ of
        Old Regular Baptist Faith and order. Surviving are her husband Richard Griffith; daughters Mrs. Elbert (Nadine) Castle of Mason, Mrs. Thomas (Faye) VanZandt of Marshall and Mrs. Cletus (Barbara) Pritchard \of Tekonsha; sons Dave, Arnold, Jerry,
        Henry and Larry Griffith, all of Tekonsha, and Bob Griffith of Independence, Missouri; seventeen grandchildren; three step-grandchildren; one great-grandchild; two step-great-grandchildren, a step- mother Mae Conley of Ohio; brothers Bubby and
        Ara Conley of Ohio; a sister Rosssline of Kentucky; and two half-brothers Charles Conley of Ohio and Jimmie Conley of Kentucky; two sons Randall and James Griffith, and a stepson Rayful Griffith preceded her in death. The family still mourns the
        passing of their mother, wife grandmother, mother-in-law and most of all a sweet friend. She was these things and more. She was a light to all who knew her. She was kind and gentle, hard-working and ever so humble, sweet-natured and patient. She
        treated her in-laws as her own children. She loved going to church or even just being where the good word was spoken, or a song of Zion was being sung. If Brother Rich headed for his car to go to church or just to visit someone, she was right
        there at his side. Her hardest time came when she could no longer go to church. She would gently rebuke you if you talked about someone. She never gave her hand to the church. Maybe the affliction of Alzheimer's overtook her first, only God knows.
        But we are convinced that she made her peace with God a few years ago and is in a better land. The affliction tried to destroy her mind and imprison her in a world by herself, but God would not allow that. Right to the very end she could greet
        us with a smile or a touch. The Lord was always on her mind. Many times when asked how she was doing, she would answer, I'm just waiting for the Lord to come and take me home. When the brothers and sisters from the church would visit sometimes
        they would sing a song of Zion, or hold prayer, it never failed to bring s.... smile and often many tears of joy to her eyes. She and brother Rich raised a large family, working long and hard because she loved them so much. I am a witness that
        her children and and the families of her children did every-thing possible to return that love. Many of them gave up their own personal lives to take care of their mother, often around the clock, seven days a week. for weeks on end. I never once
        heard any of them say it was their duty, but rather I do what I do for my mother because I love her. But they did not need to speak for the love they showed was very evident. And even though Oma was bedfast, she was always kind and loving and
        never had a cross word for anyone , no matter how bad she felt. Now the family has many fond memories of their mother so why do they still mourn her? Maybe because for several months many of them almost lived at her bedside. When you love some-one
        the way this family loved her, it takes a long time for the sadness to go away. But each day that passes, it gets a little easier, but we will never stop missing her, and her memory will never fade away, we won't let it. We think God for his tender
        mercy. Her suffering has ended and she is in a better land. We thank the friends who were there for us, and a special thanks to those at the Stone Coal Church. Your kindness will not be forgotten. And a very special thanks to Brother Earl Lawson,
        Brother Raymond Lawson, Brother Morris Wicker, Brother Jerry Manns and brother Danny Adams for going that extra mile with us. Written by: Brother Thomas VanZandt, her son-in-law</p>

    <p><strong>NANCY JANE PITTS OUSLEY</strong>: With a sad heart I shall try to write the obituary of my beloved mother. Nancy Jane Pitts Ousley was born March 31, 1898 and passed onto her eternal home July 7, 1989, making her stay here on earth 91 years,
        three months and seven days. Mommie married my beloved father March 1, 1920. He preceded her in death January 14, 1974. Unto this union were born twelve children, six of them survive. The surviving children are: Evie Thornsbury, Gardis Ousley,

    <p><strong>JEFF HALL:</strong> With the help of the good Lord I will write an obituary of my good friend and brother in the Lord, Jeff Hall. Jeff was born January 22, 1897 to Lee (Dog) Hall and Florence Thornsberry Hall, both of whom preceded him in
        death. He left this world February 12, 1989 to join four sisters and five brothers who have already gone on. In early life Jeff was married to Lena Triplett and they were blessed with eight children; three of whom preceded... him in death: Effort,
        Ivan, Estill. H e was then married to.... Cuba Jacobs, who also preceded him in death. Jeff then married Sylvia Slone and they were blessed with three..... children. Left to mourn his passing are his wife Sylvia four sons: Hershel, Lee, Jeffie
        and Vernon; two step-sons:.... David H. Jacobs and Mitchell Short; four daughters Jeanette Slone, Percy Childers, Tishie Johnson and Vadessa Combs; one brother John Wesley (Doc) Hall; two sisters: Alice Maggard and Darkie Bates, twenty-eight grandchildren,
        forty-one great grandchildren; twenty-one great-great-grandchildren; and a host of other relatives and friends. I have known Brother Jeff from a lad up. He has always been a hard-working man. In his younger days he ran a sawmill and worked continuously
        to support his family. He sawed all the lumber for the foundation and framing of the Hollybush Church. He did this and donated his time to help raise the foundation for the church. He had respect for the church and what it stood for. Brother Jeff
        has always been an honest man. If he gave you his word, you could rely on it. He was well-known and liked by all who knew him. Throughout his life he made many friends. I considered him one of my best friends. From a lad up he show- ed me love
        and respect. Never did I ask him for help but that he did all he could for me and he has helped me a lot over the years. He proved over and over again that he was my friend. Brother Jeff had been sick for the last few years. Loy and I have visited
        him many times in his home, the nursing home and the hospital. Before he got of bad, I had a long talk with him. He looked around at me with tears streaming down his face and told me that he had been praying and that he felt like the Lord had...
        forgiven him. He said he had done many things in his life that he regretted, but God is a big forgiver and has so much love for us all. He had mercy on Jeff and heard his cries. I am so thankful that Brother Jimmy, Hershel, Sylvia and Vadessa
        got to hear Brother Jeff tell that the Lord had forgiven him. He told us all that he was just waiting for the Lord to come and get him. The Lord blessed Brother Jeff greatly in his life. He let him live for ninety-two long years. Jeff put it off
        a long time and did a lot of suffering, but the Lord let him realize that he need- ed Him before he died. All the suffering and pain was worth the reward he gained in the end. Don't put it off like Jeff did. Time is too short and too precious.
        Brother Jeff could have gotten so much more joy out of life if he had turned to the Lord in his younger days. God wants us to serve Him. He blesses us in so many ways and loves us all so very much. If Brother Jeff could speak back to this family.
        I am sure he would tell you children and grandchildren to not do like he did and put it off. Now is the time to get ready, while you still have your life out in front of you. We have no promises of tomorrow, but we do have a promise of a bright
        morning and eternal life. God will.... stand by us when everyone else fails us. There is joy in serving the Lord. Words can't describe the joy that Brother Jeff found in his last days. Only God had the power to let him rejoice and..... welcome
        death. Don't be sad that Brother Jeff is gone, rejoice in the fact that he is happy and at peace. So get ready. Start today to make heaven your home. So many loved ones have already gone on. Follow in their... footsteps and be ready when the Lord
        calls. Written by a good friend and Brother in the Lord C.B. Smith</p>

        Rest with Jesus where there is no more pain and heartache. Be assured that some bright and.... glorious mourning our Lord will call us home where we will be together forever. Written by: daughter Sue Pugh and wife Viva Coleman.</p>

        and do what God wanted them to do and to pray and ask for forgiveness. Ever since Daddy has been sick and when he was at Him- self, he was praying for his children and sinner men and Women. I'd like to beg Daddy's children that have not made it
        right that you would fall out of sin and beg our Savior that He might hear them before it is too late. Not only them, but sinner men and women this wide world.... over. We don't want to write alot about our Daddy for we feel he lived the life
        before his children, his neighbors and his neighbor's children. We feel our loss is heaven's gain. Written by: his son Willard Hicks, and family.</p>

    <p><strong>MILLARD RAY BARNHAM</strong>: It's very hard for me to sit down and write the obituary of my favorite uncle, Millard Ray Barnham. He was a special uncle. Millard Ray a son, uncle and brother, was born May 26, 1924 to Duvale Barnham and Delphia
        Rowe Barnham. His father was killed in a mining accident when Ray was nine years old. Two years later his mother married Hursel Ramey and he became the father of this family, raising Ray and his..... sisters and brothers with as much love as any
        father could give. Ray left this life for a better life on January 3, 1989. he leaves behind his mother Delphia Ramey, at home two sisters: Faye Haley of Paintsville, Kentucky and Reable Smallwood of Wheelwright, Kentucky; one brother Goble Braham
        of Stoutsvills, Oh; and his nieces and nephews. A brother Jesse Barnham and his step-father Hursel Ramey preceded him in death. Ray entered the Kentucky School for the Deaf at Danville, Kentucky in 1933 and was educated there for ten years. Ray
        took pride in the fact that he worked and supported himself. He was employed by Inland Steel and later Island Creek Coal Company as a clerk in their stores. Ray's life was centered around his family and he lived to please his nieces and nephews.
        On November 14, 1987 Ray... was added to a much larger family. On that next day he was baptized as a member of the Pilgrim's Rest Regular Baptist Church by preacher Vernon Rose, Woodrow Dye, and Chuckie Hall. His church was his life, although
        he didn't get to go as often as he wanted due to sickness. Our family never thought of Ray as a handicap, as many in this outside world would say. He was thrilled to communicate with everyone that would take the time to spend with him. It pleased
        him to find anyone that could hear and take time and be interested in learning the deaf alphabet or sign language. We all know of those special times we shared with Ray and we know that it didn't take much to please him. Our family was blessed
        by God to have him and he will be greatly missed by all. He's so much better off than we are. He isn't suffering anymore. He is in God's care. Written by his nephew, Jeffrey Smallwood and mother Delphia Ramey.</p>

        a good neighbor to those who knew him. Howard never belonged to any church, yet he liked to go when he was able. I often had service here at home for him. He would talk about this dream ha had of a castle on top of a hill. There was a light on
        top of the castle and it was a struggle to get there. He also talked of this place where the water was clear as a crystal, and how on night his spirit left his body while he lay there awake and knew everything, and then returned. I feel he made

        preceded him in death. I miss him and our home is sad without him, but he suffered so long. I know he is much better off than he was here. Written by: his wife Elma Smith.</p>

    <p><strong>PATRICIA ANN GIBSON:</strong> In much sadness and with the help of the good Lord, I will try to write the obituary of my dear sister, Patricia Ann Gibson. Patty was born October 29, 1954 at Raven, Ky and departed this life February 1, 1989
        at Marion, Ohio, the result of an automobile accident. Early in life Patty was married to Carl Dwayne Gibson. They moved to Ohio to work and decided to raise a family up there. They were blessed to have two beautiful children: a daughter, Katrina
        Sue Gibson and a son, Vincent Dwayne Gibson. Left to mourn her passing are: her husband, Carl Dwayne Gibson, daughter Katrina Sue Gibson, son Vincent Dwayne Gibson; also left are her broken-hearted mother, Bethel Slone of Hollybush, Kentucky;
        four brothers: Dempsey Ray of Calendio, Ohio, Bobby Ray of Marion, Ohio, Gary of Pippa Passes Kentucky and Dwayne Eddie, also of Hollybush; one sister Barbara Jane Slone of Marion, Ohio; also a host of other relatives and many friends grieve her
        passing. Patty always worked so hard for her children and wanted them to have the things she never had. She loved them very... much and was always caring for them. She was a good mother. Patty was such a special person. She never met a stranger....
        always making friends where ever she went. She was always so jolly and always had a smile on her face. She was always willing to help others in any way she could and was always there in... their time of need. About five months before she died
        Patty Kim (my wife) and I had a long talk about the Lord and His goodness and mercy. I believe she became concerned about the welfare of her soul. Later she told the family that she was trying to get right with God. I don't believe that God will
        turn a praying heart away. nor will He let them that are praying for forgiveness die in their sins until He saves them. God doesn't look on the outside of a person He looks and searches the heart. In a dream that I believe God let me have and
        understand, I feel that sis is at rest and is waiting for that great day. So, to the rest of the family, if you don't know the Lord and you want to see Sis again start out begging to God for His mercy and forgiveness. Written by: her brother Dwayne
        Slone

    <p><strong>BELVA TRUMAN MOSLEY:</strong> It is with loving memories that we try to write an obituary of a beloved mother, grandmother, aunt and sister in the Lord,... sister Belva Mosley. She was born April 26, 1899 to Sylvester Lee and Mary Alice Truman.
        She was married in 1915 to Crofford Mosley. To this union were born nine children; four of whom preceded them in death. Brother Crofford died in 1978. Sister Bell died June 7, 1989 in Sandston, Virginia. She left four daughters and one son who
        loved her, miss her very much and will never forget her. She also has one sister: Sister Florence Caudill Cook. She is also survived by a host of grandchildren, great grandchildren, great-great-grandchildren, nieces and nephews who all loved her.
        Sister Bell wanted to die because she said she was ready to go. Everyone who knew and loved her felt a great loss when she died, but they all felt blessed to have known her. She brought... much joy to many lives. Sister Bell joined the Caney Fork
        Regular Baptist Church on December 5, 1971 and was baptised by Elder Crofford Mosley, her husband, and Elder Clive Hall. She loved the church and went as long as she was able. After she moved from Kentucky to Sandston, Virginia to live with her
        children, every time I went to visit her, her favorite subjects were the Lord, the church and her brothers and sisters of the church. To the family of aunt Bell, I would like to say that I don't know what is in your hearts, who has repented or
        who has not. But if you have not made peace with the Lord in this life, while you have the time and change, now is the time to make peace with Him. There is no repentance after death. So if you want to meet your mother again, during this lifetime
        on earth is when you must repent. May God bless you all.</p>

        and loved by the late Bird Mullins Younce. Although she was not his natural mother, his love for her was natural as God had intended. Brack is survived by Helen Ratliff Younce, his wife of forty- two and one-half years. The time they had together
        was a picture of love. An example for all the world to see. And no greater love... has ever been shown, as God had intended. Brack is also survived by his five children and eleven grandchildren. They are Larry and Sherry Younce and their children,
        Camy, Tessa and Giner; Gary and Dianna Younce and their children Gary Jr., and Misty Kay; Helen Cook and her children Allen Shane and... Debea; Brenda Carol and Butch Mace and their children: Ritta Faye and Sindy Lou; Sandra and James Flemming
        and their children..... Jamie and George. Our father and grandfather has not left us, for he will live in the hearts of his children forever, as God had intended. Brack Younce shared his time on earth with his two brothers; Ted and Sam Younce;
        and ten sisters; Rebecca, Rosie, Lona, Willa, Ruby, Mary Ellen, Betty Barbara, Drewsillia and Debbie. As the wife, children and grandchildren of Brack Younce we can assure you, his brothers and sisters, that he spoke of each of you often and that
        he loved each of you in his own.... special, silent way, as God intended. Brack raosed his family by working the coal mines in West...., Virginia and Kentucky. Though the hard times and the strubbles in the coal fields, Brack managed to keep his
        children fed and clothed, and gives credit to the United Mine Workers of America for ensuring a decent livelihood for his family. Brack Younce was a farmer, sowing seeds of love that will grow in the hearts that knew him, for eternity, as God
        intended. Brack Younce has gone to prepare a place for...,. Helen, our mother, whom we need now more than ever, so we ask you God to give her the strength to bear her grief so that she can continue to give us her love that we so desperately need,
        as God had intended, Amen. Written by family.</p>
