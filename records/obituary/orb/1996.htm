<p align="left">In loving memory of a dear husband and father, Evan Dewey

Adkins. He was born November 3, 1924 and passed away March 21, 1996, making his

stay on earth 71 years, 4 months, and 18 days. He was born at Galveston, Ky. to

the late Willie and Nancy Jane Akers Adkins. He was a retired coal miner and

construction worker. He was a World War II veteran and received the American

Theater, EAME Theater with four Bronze stars-good conduct and victory medal

while serving his country. He joined the Pilgrim's Home Old Regular Baptist

Church at Grethel. He was never baptized because of his illness. He loved to

hear the Regular Baptist Ministers preach and sing. His favorite song was,

&quot;Gone Away With A Friend. &quot; On March 1, 1946, he married Goldie Evans

Adkins. We spent fifty happy years together and were as close as two people

could be. We have eight children, Girdell, George, Phillip Dale, Earl, Clara

Lou, Michael, Mary Ann, and Patty Sue. He was a loving father and was always

there when his children needed him. He always enjoyed sitting on the porch and

visiting with family and friends. He never met a stranger. When he got sick his

neighbors, friends, and church members all visited every chance they got. His

family was always so good about staying with him. The family always made sure

someone was with him at all times. He was well-liked by all who knew him.

Besides his wife and children, he leaves 25 grandchildren and 21

great-grandchildren, one brother, Lee Adkins of Napponee, Indiana, two sisters,

Minnie Rogers of Harold, Ky., and Melba Macabee of Michigan, and a host of

family and friends to mourn his passing. Our loss is Heaven's gain. Daddy we all

love and miss you so much.</p>

<p align="left">Grant Davis Akers, son of the late James Akers and Nancy Tackett

Akers was born March 28, 1932, and deceased Sept. 26, 1996. His stay on earth

was 64 years 5 months and 29 days. He was married to Wanda Lee Hall on April 29,

1952 at the home of her parents Cleveland and Virchus Hall, by Elder Mahlon

Burke all of Jonancy, Ky. To this union were born two daughters, Lou Ann and

Sheryl Kaye. Grant leaves to mourn his loss his loving and devoted wife, Wanda;

one daughter, Lou Ann Bentley, and her husband, Herbert Bentley; one

granddaughter, Tara Ann Burke, and her husband David Burke; one grandson,

Christopher Bentley, and one great-granddaughter, Chelsea Ann Burke. She was a

special rose in his life. His daughter, Sheryl, preceded him in death. He also

leaves four brothers who will miss him: Dewey, Luther, Charlie, and Otis, all of

Dorton, Ky; one brother, Noah, preceded him in death. He leaves two sisters,

Lucille Estep of Dorton, Ky. and Gladys Carico of Fort Blackmore, Virginia.

Three sisters have preceded him in death. They were Romadale Bennett, Lissie

Flanary, and Nicie Younce. He also leaves a host of relatives and friends to

mourn his loss. At birth in 1932 he was welcomed by natural parents, but much

more important than that was his birth some time before he joined the Old Union

Church of Regular Baptist on September 10, 1983. We feel he was welcomed by

Jesus and all the saints of Heaven. He was a member of Little Robinson Creek

Church of Old Regular Baptist when he deceased.</p>

<p align="left">With the help of the Lord and a heavy heart, we will write this

obituary of our beloved sister, wife, mother and grandmother. Virginia Faye

daughter of Walter Wright of Dorton and the late Betty Quesenberry Wright. Jenny

caring and sacrificed herself to help others. Her light shone so brightly and in

her death shines brighter still. She left a light in the window and piled up a

few stones along the way to guide her loved ones home. Though our hearts are

broken and our eyes are filled with tears, we truly believe she's with her

mother and her daughter, Lucy in Heaven. Surely our loss is Heaven's gain. We

<p align="left">With saddened hearts we will, with the help of the Lord and our

family try to write this obituary of our dear mother. Dolly Marie Alexander was

born in Adams County on August 31, 1928 and passed from this life on May 25,

1996 at her home after a long illness, making her stay on this earth 67 years, 8

months and 24 days. She was preceded in death by her father, Oren Talbert Blair;

her mother Glenna Marie (Case) Bartlett; her husband, Carl Alexander; her

sister, Mary Dorothy Blair; and her brother, William Edward Blair. She is also

survived by four children: William Tong of Lynchburg, OH, Randy Tong of Port

William, OH; Roger Tong of Peebles OH; and Sue Bosier of Hillsboro, OH; two

brothers, Oren Blair Jr. of Elmville OH; and Gene Bartlett of Martinsville, OH.;

11 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren. Mom was always so active and enjoyed

life to its fullest. When Mom would be playing with the grandchildren she was as

one of them, always full of energy and vitality. Mom was a very good-hearted

lady, who knew no strangers, and fed everybody who walked in her house. Mom was

not a selfish person and she always worried about everyone but herself. But then

Mom was stricken with cancer. Before she had her operation I had one of the most

serious talks with her. I asked her that if her life would end that night, where

would her eternal home be? Heaven or Hell? She said that she had been praying

and knew that her home in Heaven was a better home to go to when she left this

old sinful world. After this, our conversations were always on Jesus and how

Heaven would be when she got there. Every time the family would gather together,

she always wanted us to sing her some old songs of Zion and hold prayer. This

past year I became closer to Mom than I ever have. Mom told us she wanted to see

us all in Heaven someday. We know that she has gone home to be with Jesus, and

she will be loved and missed by all. Some have said if God ever put an angel

here, it was Dolly.</p>

<p align="left">Cora was born February 21, 1931. She departed this life April

26, 1996, making her stay here on earth 65 years, 2 months and 3 days. Cora was

born in the home of the late Herman Mullins and Callie Stacy Mullins. Early in

life she met and married John D. Amburgey, who preceded her in death 11 years

ago. To this union were born 6 children, 1 son - Alonzo Amburgey, Indianapolis,

IN and 5 daughters - Lawana Thornsberry, Redfox, KY., Jonnie Dale Wright, Isom,

KY, Martha Amburgey, Mallie, KY, Betty Lou Thornsberry, Raven, KY and Mona

Wakesha Sammons, Jeremiah, KY Cora had 7 grandchildren whom she loved So much.

Cora is also survived by 3 brothers and 7 sisters. Cora was so good to help take

care of her loved ones. When they would get sick, she was always there to take

care of them. She would leave her home to go and take care of other people. Cora

has lived a lonely life since J.D.'s passing away. Her children have always been

so good to visit and help all they could. Cora was always an easy-going woman.

She always had a smile for everyone she met. Cora never believed in anything

fancy. She was plain and old-fashioned. She reminds me of the virtuous woman the

Bible speaks about. She was just a genuine person. Cora never did join any

church but by the life she lived and the love she had for everybody she gives us

reason to think she is in Heaven today. Her soul is resting around the throne of

God waiting for the redemption of the body. I would like to say to her children

that, if you want to see Mommy again, you will have to fall out with sin while

you live here on earth. If Mommy could speak back to you, she would tell you

that she is safe at home where she doesn't have to suffer any more. Be good to

one another and meet Mommy in Heaven where we won't have to part anymore.

Paul were taking Daddy to work, when they were struck by a drunk driver, on June

Above you have read the obituaries of two of our brothers. The simple words

written here can never give expression to how much we loved and will miss them.

It has been a great comfort to our brokenhearted parents to know that three

months before his death Tommy gave his life to God. Also, I would like to note

that after Jimmy's death, Mommy had a dream; she was sitting on the porch and

Jimmy came down in front of her, his feet didn't touch the earth. She reached to

hug him near her but was stopped when he said, &quot;Don't touch me, Mommy I

ain't been to the Lord yet.&quot; God tells us many things through our dreams

and it is our hearts' biggest hope that Jimmy is resting with Tommy at God's

feet. Written by their loving sisters</p>

Kentucky, the son of the late Wilson and Zettie (Hall) Bates. He departed this

life here on earth July 5, 1996, making his stay here on earth 76 years and ten

my heart. Sometimes I think I can't go on with out him. Vence lived eight months

after the doctors told him he had cancer. He endured his illness well. Vence was

a member of the United Mine Workers of America, he was a faithful member of

Local Union 5899 for over fifty years. He also was a member of the Joppa Old

Regular Baptist Church. He joined the Church on Feb. 27, 1996 and was baptized

<p align="left">Proverbs 31:28 Her children arise up and call her blessed; her

husband also, and he praiseth her. It is with much sadness and humbleness that

we write the obituary of a dedicated, loving wife and mother, Dova Terry

Bentley. Dova Terry was born December 5,1913 at Raven Kentucky, the child of the

late Samuel and Ruthie Reynolds Terry. She passed away on her birthday, December

5, 1995. When she was seventeen years old, Mom married the love of her life, the

late Robert Hamilton Bentley, Jr. Mom and Dad were married at Lackey, Kentucky

and they were happily married for fifty-six years. To this union were born ten

children: Clyde Bentley, of Mt. Dora, Florida; Glenna Cook of Topmost, KY; Gert

Martin of Umatilla, Florida; Betty Bentley and Sammy Bentley of Wayland, KY;

Bert Bentley of Cleveland, Ohio; Bruce Bentley of Brunswick, Ohio; Charlotte

Joseph of Prestonsburg, KY; David Bentley of Abilene, Texas and Novella Froman

great-grandchildren, as well as daughters- and sons-in-law that dearly miss her.

Also surviving to mourn her loss are her sisters, brother and sister-in-law as

follows: Elizabeth Caudill, of Melvin; Augusta Stanley, Beatrice Boyd and

Clearance Terry, all of Sandusky, Ohio; Clova Watkins of Lackey, Ky and Lanie

Terry of Estill, KY Mom was a wonderful, giving, sacrificing Mother and great

cook. These words seem to fall short in describing her. Everyone was made

welcome to her home and she took great joy in cooking for her family, friends

and visitors. Mom was, first and foremost, Mom to her children. She loved for

them to come home; her family was her life. During her illness, Mom's attitude

was a great inspiration. Mom had cancer and she said, &quot;It's just one of

those things, everybody had to die. It's just my time.&quot; She had such

dignity during this trying time. Mom never got over losing Dad and is now in

Heaven with him where they are having a wonderful reunion. If Mom could talk to

us now, she would simply say, &quot;Get ready to meet us in Heaven.&quot; We

miss her so much. Like when King David lost his son, he said, according to II

Samuel 12:22 &amp; 23: &quot; . . . while the child was yet alive, I fasted and

wept: for I said, who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the

child may live? But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him

back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.&quot; We can all

get ready to meet the Lord and we can have a big family reunion in Heaven

<p align="left">Dorothy Compton Billiter, daughter of the late Jim and Della

Compton, was born July 10, 1916, at Yeager, KY. She passed away October 20,1995

in East Liverpool, OH. She was also preceded in death by her husband Sherl

Edward Billiter, and one brother Willie Lee Compton. Survivors are a son, Larry

Edward Billiter, East Liverpool, OH, and a daughter, Lena Faye Guysinger, Akron,

OH, seven grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. After completing college,

Dorothy taught school several years. When her husband passed away she moved to

Ohio to be near her children, and worked as a sales manager there. Dorothy was a

devoted mother and grandmother. She always had time for a game with a nephew,

school event with a grandchild, or an afternoon babysitting a great-grandchild.

Dorothy had a lot of love to share and she shared it every day. She loved her

husband Ed, and loved her children. She began her life in the church when her

son was six years old. He was seriously ill and she prayed that if he would

live, she would dedicate her life to the Lord. She kept her promise and spent

the rest of her days as a faithful member of the Old Regular Baptist Church. She

enjoyed reading the Bible and read it completely through many times. Through a

long illness, her faith never wavered and she bore her pain uncomplaining. She

loved her parents and sisters and brothers, and there are so many pleasant

memories of the early years when all eight children were together. In later

years when the sisters and brothers married and some, like Dorothy, moved away,

they all continued to stay close and gather together each year. Dorothy

especially loved these times and though she can no longer be with us, in days to

come when the family gathers, her love and laughter will be remembered. Since

the writing of this obituary, Dorothy's only daughter, Lena Faye passed away May

25, 1996, and is buried beside her mother and father on the Compton cemetery at

Collins.</p>

on earth in southeastern Kentucky. He meet and married Hazel Conn Jarrell Boyd

on February 27, 1940 and took three young girls as his own. They were blessed

with a daughter, Georgene. Poppy was a veteran of World War II, entering the

U.S. Army on January 30, 1941. He was there at the battle of Normandy, at the

Rhineland, and the Campaign of Northern France. Among his decorations and

citations were three Bronze Stars, American Defence Service Metal and Purple

Heart. He was a lifetime member of the Disabled American Veterans. Poppy worked

as a coal miner and a carpenter, building houses, bridges and dams. He was a

member of Carpenter Local #23. After a long and trying illness Poppy passed this

earth February 11, 1996, leaving this earth a better place for him having been

here. Those left to mourn his passing are his wife, Hazel Conn Jarrell Boyd, who

was there with him till the end; daughter, Georgene Wright, who will never

forget her Daddy's love; daughters Emogene Boyd, Lillian Boyd and Burlene Neal,

who thank God Granny found Poppy to be their father, and they know how he loved them. He leaves brothers, Henry, Luther and John Boyd. They will never get to go squirrel hunting or ginsinging with him on this earth again. He also leaves sisters: Goldie Conn, Mary Jarrell, Lassie Hart, Minnie Crisp and Claudla Manhart, who will miss a brother's love. He leaves 15 grandchildren, who are better people for having had Poppy; 36 greatgrandchildren; 14 great-great-grandchildren; who will lose, for they will not have had the chance to know Poppy. He also leaves a great number of nieces and nephews whom he loved, and they in turn loved him. Also many many friends.<br>

Poppy enjoyed going to church and had a great belief in God. Although he never attached himself to any church, his desire was to be kept the last few days and nights on earth at the Little Salem Old Regular Baptist Church. This leaves me to believe that our loss is Heaven's gain.<br>

Poppy we love and miss you.<br>

world on January 8, 1996. She was the daughter of the late George and Mary

Hamilton Tackett. At age 20 she married the late Carl Leon Brafford, and to that

grandchildren and a large number of nieces and nephews. A special friend, Fern

Sword of Robinson Creek, is also left behind to mourn Arizona's passing. Arizona

was a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church on Robinson Creek for over 24

years. She was an inspiration to all who knew her, and many of her relatives and

friends drew strength and encouragement from her perserverance, as she suffered

a number of serious illnesses, including cancer. From the beautiful life that

she lived, all that knew and loved her should be comforted with the thought that

our loss is truly Heaven's gain. The memories of her kind heart and sweet spirit

will be written upon the hearts of those she left behind, for generations to

<p align="left">It is with a sad and lonely heart and the help of the good Lord

that I will try to write the obituary of our dearly beloved husband, father, and

grandfather, Hiram Branham. Hiram was born February 15, 1922, the son of Belva

and Nellie Egan Branham. He is survived by his wife of nearly 49 years, Margie

Gregory Branham, whom he married April 12, 1947. To this union was born one

daughter, Kay Branham Strode. He leaves his daughter and grandsons, Harold Wayne

and Darby Layne Strode, whom he loved very much. God called him home January 13,

1996 at St. Claire Medical Center, Morehead, Kentucky, at the age of 73 years,

10 months, and 29 days. Also surviving are his 91-year-old mother, 1 son-in-law,

4 brothers, 4 sisters, and a host of friends and relatives to mourn his death.

His father and one sister preceded him in death. At the age of 36 years he

surrendered his heart to Jesus. On the second Sunday in July, 1958, while down

on his knees in our home, he felt the Lord saved his soul. He was so happy! On

Saturday, October 1, 1958, he gave his hand to become a member of the Hayes

Branch United Baptist Church and was baptized on Sunday. He was a faithful

member for 28 years and served there as a deacon for 20 years. At the time of

his death he was a member of the Mt. Sterling Old Regular Baptist Church, where

he served as a deacon for 9 years. Hiram truly loved the Lord and the old-time

Baptist way. He loved all the old songs. Some of his favorite ones were &quot;I

Love My Savior God Because He First Loved Me,&quot; &quot;Amazing Grace,&quot;

and &quot;How I Come to Love These Pilgrims.&quot; He told us many times that

when the good Lord called he was ready to go and that he was not afraid to die.

Shortly before he left us, he tried to tell me something. I said, &quot;Honey, I

didn't understand you. What did you say?&quot; In a low, calm voice he said,

&quot;You'd be surprised. you'd be surprised.&quot; I believe with all my heart

that through spiritual eyes, he viewed his Heavenly home. Our home here is so

lonely without him, but I feel for a surety that some sweet day we will meet

where there will be no tears, pain, or sorrow. And, we will never again have to

say, &quot;good-bye.&quot; So, children, grandsons, brothers, sisters, and

friends, if you haven't made peace with the Lord, his prayer would be,

&quot;Repent and be born again, and meet me in Heaven.&quot; Written in loving

memory by his wife, Margie, and family</p>

Five daughters: Emma Lue Peppard of Nova, Ohio; Anna Sue Lilly and Jewell D.

deceased in 1979. Mom joined the `Pilgrims Home' Church in Grethel, Ky. on July

19, 1951. Dad joined there on March 26, 1954 and was baptized on April 17, 1954.

In 1955 Charlie and Clara moved to Nova, Ohio. They both moved their letters to

the Little Pilgrims Home Church in Ruggles, Ohio. Dad and Mom named this church

and were members there until they retired and moved to Ocala, Florida in

September 1979. They then moved their letters to churches in Florida. Mom

belonged to Mary Elizabeth in Hollister, Florida under Elder Hansford Short, Jr.

Moderator. I recall Mom calling Brother Short &quot;Little Boy.&quot; She loved

singing and rejoicing the good old-fashioned Regular Baptist songs. Our hearts

are so sad dened from the loss of our dear mother and loved ones who are gone to

live with Jesus. Mom never met a stranger! Her smile and open arms were always

open to express how much love and kindness she had for everyone. Mom and Dad

taught us to love each other in so many different ways. They lived for Jesus

through the good times and hard times. God was like a hammer pounding in their

hearts that guided them throughout their lives. I deeply feel that my Mom and

Dad both are together in Heaven. I had a vision that Mom is a angel with wings

of gold. She met Daddy at the gate on March 25, 1996. Mom had an uncountable

number of friends from everywhere. She loved to live, travel, and sing for her

Lord for as long as I can remember. My dear mother was an inspiration to us all.

She gave us love, advice, and prayed for all of her children, grandchildren and

great-grandchildren. Mom loved her church, family, and friends. Daddy and Mommy

left us all a large trail to follow!! I feel God blessed us with the greatest

parents in the world. The memories are what we must cherish and treasure until

we meet them again. If Mom and Dad could tell us, it would be this:

&quot;Children look up and follow us; we are safely home now with all of our

loved ones, don't weep over us; we are rejoicing with Jesus; Take up the cross,

dear little ones and follow Jesus, so Mom and Dad can meet you again

someday.&quot; Spiritually, I know Mommy is in Heaven rejoicing. It's nature's

flesh that we'll miss. Just remember to look up and give Jesus the praise for

Mommy and Daddy are together forever. Our loss is Heaven's gain! Pray to God and

live for Jesus. Sadly missed by her family and friends. God Bless All. Written

It is with much sadness and a broken heart that Iwill try to write an obituary of my father, Calvin C. Burke. Dad was born december 8, 1924 in Weeksbury Kentucky. The son of Boles and Lille Mae (Ray) Burke. He departed this life on July 4, 1996., making his stay on this earth 71 years 6 months and 27 days.<br>

Dad married Bertha (Ramsey) Burke on January 16, 1945. Unto this union were born three children: two sons, C. Michael Burke of Huber Heights, Ohio, and Kenneth R. Burke of West Chester, Ohio; and one daughter, Dawn Rita Rider of Springfield, Ohio. The Lord blessed Dad with eight grandchildren and thirteen great-grandchildren. He also had four sisters, Edith Burns of Springfield, Ohio, Melissa Blevins of South Vienna, Ohio, Dorothy Grizzel of Hamilton, Ohio, and Dora Watson of Mildford, Ohio. He had a host of friends and family to mourn their loss. He was preceded in death by his loving wife and his parents.<br>

Dad's life was all about the Old Regular Baptist Church. He placed his membership over 45 years ago at the Enterprise Old Regular Baptist Church at Indian Creek, Kentucky. He joined the church in July of 1951. Because we moved to Ohio, Dad would travel to all the churches around Ohio. Where he went the most was Little Bethel. Dad never met a stranger; he would love to talk to anyone about the Lord who would listen. Dad would love to travel to all the Associations arid find out about all the churches.<br>

Dad had been sick for years, but the last year Dad went down real fast. In June the doctors told Dad he had cancer; it didn't stop his faith in his Lord. He said, " I can't give up," and he said, " I will be satisfied when the Lord's will is done, and not my will." Dad always wanted the Lord's will done and it was. He would love for the brothers and sisters of the church to come and visit him. Two nights before

Dad died some of the brothers and sisters were sitting up with us and Dad's dear

friend, Larry Dixon, sang &quot;Gone Away With a Friend.&quot; Well, that is

just what Dad did, he went away with his friend, Jesus. I believe the angels

were in his room waiting till the Lord said, &quot;No more suffering, bring my

child home.&quot; If we are ever to see our daddy again, we to have to turn to

the the Lord and wait until He calls us home. I am glad I had him for my father.

He gave me lots of love and understanding, but most of all he showed me how to

love and live for the Lord. I will always miss my daddy, but one day the Lord

will call me home and there Iwill see my mother and father again. Written by his

daughter, Dawn Rita Rider</p>

<p align="left">It is with a sad and aching heart that I will try to write the

obituary of my beloved mother and sister in Christ, Arizona Moore Frazier

Caudill. Mom passed on to that eternal home on April 21, 1996. First, she was a

Christian and a member of the Pilgrim's Rest Church of the Old Regular Baptist.

She was born December 22, 1912, making her stay on this earth 89 years and four

months. She was the daughter of the late Richard Moore and Hannah Gayhart Moore

Adams. She was one of six children of whom three brothers and one sister

preceded her in death. Only one sister remains, Wyoma Tackett. Mom had been in a

nursing home for 14 months prior to her passing. Birdie was there daily to see

her and attend to her needs, to prompt her to get out of bed and face a new day.

Arizona was married to the late Armpie Lewis Frazier, December 24, 1929, and to

this union was born two children, Rubin Delmas Frazier of Newport News, Virginia

and Birdie Lucille Park of St. Petersburg, Florida. There were three

grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Mom joined the Pilgrim's Rest Church

of the Old Regular Baptist in April 1933 and when she was able she faithfully

filled her seat in her church and worshiped and praised her God in a way that

only she could. The last time that I saw her, she told me, &quot;I don't know

why the Lord is leaving me here, I'm ready to go to meet my Savior.&quot; She

loved the Lord. Mom was married to Lee Caudill on December 8, 1962 and they were

faithful to each other and to the Lord and always worshiped together. She leaves

one stepdaughter, Goldie Jones, to mourn her loss. Mom was always available to

help those in need. She was often called upon to go and help with the sick and

usually stayed there, forsaking all else, until that sickness was resolved. She

was a nurse, a minister, a waiter and a servant and all other things that God

had called her to be. She will be greatly missed and I pray that whoever reads

this obituary will see her again in &quot;that place not made by hands, eternal

in the Heavens&quot; because I'm sure that she is with the Lord shouting and

praising Him as she once did when we attended church together. Jesus said,

&quot;In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have

told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for

you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, ye may be

<p align="left">Oct. 2, 1903 - June 6, 1996 With much sadness and regret I will

attempt to write an obituary of my grandpa, Hie Click. Grandpa was born October

2, 1903 to Ulysses (Doe) and Amanda Click. He spent the next 92 years, until his

death, June 6, 1996, on the same creek where he was born. In early life at the

age of 29, he met and married Myrtle Boyd Click on Jan 6, 1932. To this union

were born 4 children N.D. Click, Fayetteville, North Carolina, Richard Click,

Wabash, Indiana, Rubestene Akers, Martin, Kentucky and Lavone Conn who preceded

him in death on April 15, 1986. Grandpa and Granny started their housekeeping in

what was called &quot;hard times,&quot; back when it was hard to make a dollar.

He plowed fields, worked in the coal mines, laid pipe lines. worked on the W.PA.,

and his last employment was with the C &amp; O Railroad. After the children were

grown and moved away on their own, God saw fit to separate this union of 36

years. On November 20, 1968, death caused a breach in this family by removing a

faithful companion and mother. For the next 24 years Grandpa made his home with

us. Not many grandchildren are as fortunate as us to be raised under the same

roof as their grandparent. This will make giving him up that much harder because

the closer the union the tighter the bond. Within this earthly union Grandpa

leaves behind to mourn his passing, 3 children, 10 grandchildren, 11 great

grandchildren, and 6 step-great grandchildren. But there is another union and a

different bond called the &quot;the grace of God.&quot; It was within this union

and this bond that he confessed a hope and a willingness to follow the Lord into

baptism. On August 28, 1993, at the age of 89, it was my privilege, with the

help of Elder Bill Tackett, to lay him in the watery grave. His last months here

were spent in declining health and a desire to go to a better world. He once

said in the hospital, &quot;I won't die till my time comes.&quot; When that time

came his passing was as that of one just falling asleep. Death has once more

caused a breach in this family. It once again brings mourning and sorrow as a

constant reminder of God's judgment upon the transgression of the first man he

made and upon all his descendants. But by the grace of God and the victory given

us through his son Jesus Christ we shall all meet again in a world without end.

<p align="left">This is in loving memory of our mother and grandmother, Lola

Click, who passed away on September 8 1995. Lola was born on May 11, 1906, in

Hindman, Ky. She was the daughter of David and Margie Smith Parks. She had one

sister, Leala Parks Terry of Garner, Ky, to whom she was extremely close When

John Click, son of Ezekiel and Suzanne Amburgey Click, was 10 years old he

spotted Lola across the playground at school and said to friends, &quot;That's

the girl I'm going to marry.&quot; After marriage John worked as a coal miner.

Lola raised two daughters, a garden, canned and preserved food, and was a great

cook. She made the most beautiful quilts that you can imagine. Lola was always

there for her family and neighbors. She would give a hug or a word of

encouragement. She would share the food they had or nurse a neighbor back to

health. She was very loved and well respected. Baptized into the Old Regular

Baptist Church, she was a member for 54 years. Lola and John were both deeply

religious people. In later years, she had diabetes and became unable to care for

herself. After John's death on February 11, 1991, she lived with her daughter

Evelee, and very special son-in-law, Gene Dixon. She received wonderful care and

we all feel this added many years to her life. We were blessed to have this

precious person with us for 89 years. John and Lola were more than good people

who worked hard and were well respected. They were the catalyst that held us

together as a family, gave us strength, guidance, and most of all, gave us

unconditional love. Now they are together in death, as in life, in Heaven, as on

earth. Totally devoted to each other. Both will live in our memory and hearts

forever. Lola is deeply missed by her sister, Leala Parks Terry; two daughters,

Maxine Olson and Evelee Dixon. She is also survived by grandchildren: Brenda

Olson Starsia, Randy Olson, David Dixon and Crystal Dixon Green;

great-grandchildren, Kimberly Hamwi Frye, Brittany Parker, Matthew Olson and

Christopher Olson; and great-great-grandchild, Courtland Frye II. Written with

love by granddaughters, Brenda and Kimberly</p>

<p align="left">With a loving heart we will try to write an obituary in memory

of our beloved mother, Margaret Coffey. She was born November 19, 1910 in

Magoffin County, Kentucky to Kelly Hale and Mary Vanderpool. She was married to

Dormant Coffey November 19,1931. To this union were born four children, Buel

(deceased), Mildred Fulton of Ray, Marjorie Brooks of Wellston, and Arnold

Coffey of Ray. She was preceded in death by her loving husband of over

fifty-five years. Brother Dormant passed away in May of 1987. She was also

preceded by her oldest son, Buel, in October of 1963. Margaret is survived by

her three children, eight grandchildren (Pat Ross Mcwhorter, David Ross, Johnny

Ross, Rick Brooks, Pam Brooks Updike, Jeff Coffey, Scott Coffey, and Jarrod

Coffey), eleven great-grandchildren, several brothers and sisters, and a host of

relatives and friends. Sister Margaret was a very hard worker all through her

life. She enjoyed raising a huge garden and many beautiful flowers. She always

enjoyed cooking big meals for her family and church friends. Sister Margaret was

a great witness to her family and friends. It was indeed a great witness that

her children never in their lives heard their mother raise her voice in anger or

say anything harmful about anyone. We have been truly blessed to have had such a

wonderful mother and friend. We look forward to meeting Mother and Daddy on the

streets of Glory some sweet day. Our loss is certainly Heaven's gain. Sadly

missed by Mildred &amp; Bob Fulton, Margie Brooks Arnold, and Brenda Coffey</p>

<p align="left">Bennie Collins was born on May 1, 1935 at Raven, Ky. He left

this world of trouble on December 8, 1995, making his stay here on earth 60

years, 7 months, and 8 days. He was the son of Arminda Short Collins and Robert

Collins, both of whom preceded him in death. On August 26,1955, Bennie was

married to Dina Page of Whitesburg, Ky. To this union were born 2 daughters,

Beverly Carol of Somerset and Gloria of Raven. One son, Jeffery Ray, preceded

Bennie in death. His 2 sons-in-law, Marcus Huff and Kenneth Slone, were loved by

Bennie as his own children. His 3 beloved grandchildren, Jason, Jennifer, and

Jillian, like us, have lost a dear person in their lives. Daddy was a fair and

just man who was loved and respected by all who knew him. He was a wonderful

father who used kind words as a means of discipline with his children. On March

the 25, 1979, Bennie was baptized into the Providence Old Regular Baptist

Church. We feel that it was one of the happiest days of Daddy's life. Bennie was

preceded in death by his 3 brothers, Frank, C., and Isadore. He leaves 1 sister,

Virgie Caudill of Kendalville, Ind. and a host of nieces, nephews,

sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law, and friends, as well as his Brothers and

Sisters in the Church. God had a plan for Daddy. We, who watched his suffering

didn't understand. I sometimes think God used Daddy to be an inspiration to

others. He was so sick for many years, getting worse as time went by. We watched

him suffer for so long and while he could still speak, he would call,

&quot;Jesus, Jesus&quot; He never questioned, &quot;Why me?&quot; He just kept

his faith and we feel that eternal rest with Jesus will be Daddy's reward. On

December the 8, 1995, the angels came and took him home. Written by the Family

<p align="left">If the Lord will help me I will try to write the obituary of my

loving Mother, Lillie Marie Leedy Compton, who passed from this life and entered

into eternal rest on Oct. 1, 1995 at Pikeville Methodist Hospital. It is so hard

to write about someone you loved so much, someone you had been with all your

life. With the help of the Lord all things are possible. Our Mother was the

oldest child born to William &quot;Bill&quot; Leedy and Elsie Bray Leedy. Mom

was born March 6, 1913. She was 82 years. and 7 months old at her passing. I

miss Mom so much, the old home place is so lonesome, but we have good memories

and the help of the Lord to help us along. The last words she said to me

&quot;I'll see you in the morning; don't worry about me I'm all right&quot;. I

believe I'll see her in the morning and I do believe she is all right. Mom was a

member of the Island Creek Old Regular Baptist Church for over 50 years. She

loved the Church and her Brothers and Sisters very much. At a young age Mom was

married to our Dad, Georgie Compton. They married July 16, 1932. Dad passed away

Feb. 23, 1975, at the young age of 66 years. Mom and Dad were blessed with four

children, two daughters, Emilee Justice, Island Creek, Pikeville, Ky. and Patty

Canupp, Columbus, Ohio; two sons, Cecil Compton, Ann Arbor, Mich. J.B. Compton,

Island Creek, Pikeville, Ky. She also left seven grandchildren and four

great-grandchildren. One great-grandchild preceded her in death, and two

step-great-grandchildren. Mom also left three sisters: Maxie Reynolds Venore,

Tennessee; Cleo Thomas Ypsilanti, Mich.; and Helena Justice, Betsy Layne, Ky.,

and two brothers, Henry Leedy, Ashland, Ky. and Edward Leedy, Betsy Layne, Ky.

After Mom passed away I was going through some of her things. I found this card

she had gotten from my brother for Mother's Day. She had written on the

envelope. &quot;To be read at my funeral, it is for all children;&quot; I didn't

find it until after her funeral so I am putting it in her obituary. What Mothers

Mean To Me Mothers means the memories, and thoughts I'll always treasure of

happy childhood days gone by and joy beyond all measure. Mothers mean a special

smile and tender loving care, good advise and a listening ear when I have

thoughts to share. Mothers means the magic touch that makes a happy home, and

loving thoughts that follow me whereever I may roam Mothers mean a lot of things

that words cannot define. When she's the wonderful Mother I'm so lucky to call

mine. Written for the family with much love in my heart for everyone of you.

Let's all put our trust in the Lord, and let him lead us, so we can all meet Mom

in Heaven some day. In loving memory, daughter Emilee Justice</p>

<p align="left">It is with great sorrow, and a broken heart we will try to write

of one we love so much. But God loved him too, so he let him go to sleep in him,

and stopped his pain until he comes to take him home. Earnest was born in Knott

County to Willie Buncker Conley and Martha (Ramey) Conley on January 1, 1921 and

was taken away from us on April 25, 1995, making his stay here on earth 74

years, 3 months, and 21 days. He married Edna Mae Paige on July 3, 1944, and to

this union were born five children. Two preceded him in death, Mitchell Lee and

Larry Ray. Two sons and one daughter survive him, James M. Conley and Lema Sue

Gibson of Mousie, Kentucky, and Leonard Conley of Fort Wayne, Indiana; ten

grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. He had three brothers and three

sisters that survive him: Marion (Huger) Conley, Melvin Conley, Lillie Green And

Hester Scott, all of Mousie, Kentucky.; Merritt Conley and Beatrice Collins of

Mcguffy, Ohio, and a host of friends and family. He loved his family very much,

and would help anyone in anyway he could. He worked all his life in the

underground coal mines, and was a retired UMWA coal miner of local union number

1745, of which he was very proud to be a part. He repented on April 22, 1994,

but wasn't able to be baptized in the Old Regular Baptist Church until September

18, 1994 due to his health, and continuous hospital stays. When Jesus comes

back, we will be with our husband and daddy again, never to be parted. Your

<p align="left">The blessings of the Lord are manifested in countless ways - not

the least of which is a kind, gentle, and loving mother and grandmother. Rosa

Cole was truly such a blessing to all who knew her. Through her actions, Mamaw

was a wonderful mother, grandmother, wife, neighbor, friend and Christian. A

selfless and generous person, Mamaw cherished every moment with her family and

was always willing to help others. Her sharp wit and keen sense of humor were

refreshing and often surprising and made our time with her even more enjoyable.

She was able to maintain her good spirits even in time of sickness. She loved to

read her Bible and attend church. Although on many occasions she was not

physically well, she made the extra effort to be in the Lord's house. Surely the

Lord has blessed her faithfulness. We believe that Mamaw is victorious over

death today. If we could hear her speak to us, I believe she would lovingly tell

us to rejoice for her victory and that she will never experience any more pain

or suffering. Truly, our loss is Heaven's gain. We hope and pray to be reunited

with her. She was born on March 1, 1911, to the late Wilburn and Tannie Johnson

Brown. On June 3, 1996, she departed her earthly life to enter into paradise

with the Lord. In addition to her parents and her husband, Dave, Rosa was

predeceased by a brother, Northern Brown, and two grandchildren, Timothy Damron

and Teresa Newsom. She is survived by two daughters, Bernice King and Loretta

Newsom, and one son, Ralph Cole, all of Robinson Creek, Kentucky; one sister,

Vassie Flanery of Robinson Creek, Kentucky; and four brothers: Alvin Brown of

Robinson Creek, Kentucky, Ballard Brown of Columbus, Ohio, Johnny Brown of

loved them all as his very own and always gave them good advise. He leaves three

half-sisters, five half-brothers and a host of nieces and nephews. It pleased

him when any of them came to see him at least once a year. Hezzie became a

member of the Cold Spring Old Regular Baptist Church. He always rushed me to get

started when the third Saturday and Sunday of each month came. He wanted to fill

his seat as long as he was able. He enjoyed hearing good preaching and singing.

When we got back home, he would say, &quot;We had a good meeting today.&quot; My

I'll be with him some sweet day where we won't have to part anymore. He has left

<p align="left">With great love, wonderful memories, a broken heart, and with

the help of our almighty God, I will try to write this precious obituary of my

loving brother. Tilton was a loving husband, devoted father to both his children

and grandchildren, a son to his father and mother, as well as to his

father-in-law and mother-in-law, a brother to his brothers and sisters, his

brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, an uncle to a host of nieces and nephews, a

friend to those that needed a friend and above all, I do believe, a son with our

Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ This loving son was born at Price, Kentucky,

February 10, 1941 to Woodrow and Monnie Brown Dye. He died September 19, 1996,

at The Veterans' Hospital in Lexington, KY, making his stay on God's footstool

fifty-five years, seven months and nine days. Tilton enlisted in the United

States Army the summer of 1962. After training, he was sent to Vietnam where he

served with honor and received the Air Metal with Oak Leaf Cluster. He is

survived by his wife of thirty-two years, Maxine Stumbo Dye, Price, KY; two

daughters, Shelly Marie (Michael) Newman, Lexington, KY, Angela Renee (Kevin)

Spurlock, Price, KY; his parents, Woodrow and Monnie Brown Dye, Printer, KY;

brothers: Milton of Columbus, Ohio; Andy of Printer, KY; Litton (Jimmy) of

Price, KY; and Ricky of Lexington, Ky; sisters: Freda Goins, Gleda Johnson and

Lucy Reynolds all of Printer, KY; three grandchildren: Tilton Kyle, Trenton

Michael, and Hannah Sheree, and a host of nieces and nephews. On the fourth

Saturday of June 1968, at Little Nancy Church, there was rejoicing in Heaven,

when Tilton and Mom gave their hands to the Church. Dad and Elder Matt Justice

baptized them the next day. Sometime later Tilton felt another calling from his

Lord and Savior to go preach the gospel - and was ordained as a minister on

March 24, 1973. Tilton took his calling seriously and cast his lot faithfully.

Later, Tilton and Mom came to be with Dad at the Pilgrim's Rest Church where he

was a faithful member to the end. In closing I would like to say to Maxine,

Shelly, and Angela, &quot;If you want to see Tilton again, you can, but you will

have to go the way he did and that is through Jesus Christ.&quot; I would like

to say Dad, &quot;No, you don't have Tilton to walk with you and talk to you on

this side of the Jordan River, but on the other side in the Promised Land, we

will see him as an Angel of God.&quot; Mom, you won't have to ask Tilton to rest

now, he's at rest. May God continue to comfort us. Written by his brother,

<p align="left">With much sadness and a broken heart we will try to write an

obituary of a loving husband, father and grandfather, Kendall Evans. He was born

October 24, 1932 to the late John B. and Betty Howell Evans. On December 31,

1955 he married Sylvia Tackett Evans. To this union were born 4 children:

Marcella Newsome of Grethel; Gary Douglas, Chris Shannon and Teresa Evans all of

Craynor. We have two daughters-in-law, Verdie Mae Evans and Patricia Evans of

Craynor, and one son-in-law, Burchell Newsome of Grethel. Kendall loved these

three as if they were his own. We also have six grandchildren whom we love with

all our hearts, one of whom preceded him in death, Burchell Newsome Jr.

Remaining are Petrina and Avery Jody Newsome, Kent Dougless, Heather Dawn, and

Christopher Brandon Evans. He has one sister, Hattie Howell of Craynor, and four

brothers, Hatter Evans of Grethel, Jay B and Edgar Evans, both of Dayton, Ohio

and Tivis Evans of Craynor, who followed him in death four months later. He was

a retired construction worker, coal miner and the neighborhood carpenter. It's

so hard to go on without him, I wish we could have had more time together, time

just went by too fast. We just had one short month together after he took sick,

the doctors and nurses didn't think he would make it three or four times. But

the good Lord let us keep him a little longer. Kendall was in the hospital about

three weeks the last time, and the last week he kept asking us to bring him

home, he wanted to come home so bad he would say &quot;Lets go home hon, you got

the car we can just go.&quot; I asked the doctor if there was any way possible

to bring him home, a few hours later the doctor let us bring him home. Kendall

got to come home with us one week before God took him from us. The last spell he

took he was praying and raised his arms in the air, we thought he was reaching

for us, and we took hold of his arms, but I'm sure he was reaching for Jesus.

Kendall was a very kind and loving man to all his family, friends and neighbors.

He never saw a stranger and was willing to help anybody who needed it. We sure

do miss him, it doesn't seem possible that he's gone, it seems like he's still

here taking care of us. We sure do love and miss him, and I hope that the Lord

finds a few odd jobs to keep him busy until we see him again. Written by his

four brothers: Halter Evans of Grethel, KY; Jay B. and Edgar Evans of Dayton,

Ohio; and one brother, Kendal Evans, our dad, who died four months earlier on

December 3, 1995. Tivis never met a stranger, he always had a kind word to say

to everyone. When you were around him he kept you laughing by making jokes, even

when he was sick in the hospital he would come up with something to make you

smile. Tivis had to have one of his feet taken off and he would still joke about

himself to make everyone else feel better. He said one day that the nurse asked

him how tall he was and he had replied, I'm 5' 5&quot; on one side and a

&quot;foot&quot; shorter on the other. Tivis loved music of all kinds, he would

sit and listen to the radio or tapes. As often as he could, he would make tapes

for all of us, from some of his favorite music. Shortly before Tivis died he was

in the Prestonsburg Hospital; he said he had seen our dad lying on a bed in

front of him, just watching him. Mom told Tivis that dad was still looking after

him, as all his family had done before. Tivis loved all his family so much.

Shortly before he passed away he spoke of his children and how he wanted them to

be taken care of and to tell his family that he loved every one of us. Tivis

will be sadly missed by all his family and friends. But we know he is in a

better place now. He is in Heaven, he and Daddy are with Grandma and Grandpa,

Old Regular Baptist Church at McDowell where she remained a member until her

death on January 1, 1996. She was a member of the Old Regular Baptist Church for

in Pike County, Kentucky, the only child of Ida Bevins Caines and Kenis H.

Caines. She was a 1929 graduate of Eastern Kentucky State Normal College. She

taught school in Pike County from 1930 to 1933. A fellow teacher introduced her

to her son, Thomas M. Gilbert, to whom she was married on December 20, 1931. Dad

passed away October 14, 1987. Three children were born to Mexie and Tom: Thomas

I. of Lorain, Ohio; John C. of Vermilion, Ohio; and Marlene Hoyarth of Indian

Harbor Beach, Florida. Mom was a homemaker and substitute teacher until 1960,

when she became a fulltime sewing instructor for the Singer Sewing Machine Co.

in Lorain, where we had moved to in 1940. Mom and Dad both retired in 1976 and

moved to Melbourne, Florida where they spent their &quot;golden years.&quot; Mom

enjoyed golf, bowling, cooking and sewing, but her greatest pleasure was in

fellowshipping with the congregation of Myrtle Church into which she had been

admitted upon giving her life over to God and being baptized on August 29, 1982.

Mom returned to Ohio in 1992 and attended Little Edna Church, which was in

correspondence with Myrtle Church, as often as she could. Mom departed this

earth on October 12, 1995, and joined Dad at Heaven's door, from whence we all

hope for glory. Survivors, in addition to her three children, include seven

grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren. We are comforted by the gospel of

Matthew which says &quot;Blessed are they that mourn,&quot; for we know that Mom

freely accepted the gift of salvation and the promise of eternal life. The

following bit of verse, by an anonymous author, approaches what we all feel in

our hearts. When God looked down upon the earth And chose to put new blessings

there He gave the sky the sunset's glow Gave laughter gay to children's play;

love the best lives closley shrined within each breast - a mother. &quot;Her

children arise and call her blessed.&quot; Proverbs 31:28 Written by her son and

friend, Tom Gilbert</p>

weary and needed rest. Mom told us children that the Lord was waiting on the

other side with His arms open for her, and that she wanted to go home with Him,

that she had a better home waiting for her. She had made peace with the Lord, In

April 1996 the fourth day, God called our precious Mommy away. Mom has gone to

Heaven above, where all is peace, joy, and love, Mom how we miss you around the

old home, our hearts fill so alone. There not a day that goes by that your not

<p align="left">It is with a sad and broken heart that I will try to write an

obituary of our father and grandfather, Hi Hall. He was the son of Hiram and

Nancy Hall. He was born July 16, 1933 in Knott County and departed this life

April 10, 1996. As a young man he married Bethel Mae Johnson, September 4, 1953.

Out of this union of love were five sons: Danny Hall, Frank Hall, Teddy Hall,

Dwayne Hall, and Timothy Hall; one daughter, Fanny Hall, and ten grandchildren.

Dad had six brothers and five sisters. Preceding him in death were four brothers

and two sisters. Surviving him are two brothers, James Hall and Richard Hall.

Dad was a man that everybody liked. He worked in the coal mines to provide for

his family. Dad could always tell if something was wrong with one of the

children. He would stay awake at night worrying over them. I believe Dad's

suffering is over. He would always say, &quot;Weep not for me, but weep for

yourself.&quot; The last few years of his life Dad and Mom began going to church

regularly. Dad loved to attend Providence Church at Dry Creek, Ohio. How he

loved to hear the preaching and singing there. Many lonely nights at home he

would be calling upon the name of the Lord, praying for us children. The Bible

says that &quot;Whosoever call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot; I

hope the children will live a better life, and love Mom while we have her with

us, and not worry her. Let us all begin to change our ways and prepare to meet

Daddy in that beautiful home. So often Dad would go talk to Monroe Jones and

other preachers, asking them to pray for him. His conversations differ as well

as his ways. Anyone who knew Dad could see the change in his life. Mom, Dad

loved you! You and he were so happy together. Today his voice is still, a vacant

place around home. I know you are lonely, but try to be glad, rejoice, and rest

in comfort knowing that Dad is much better off at home with Jesus! Written by

his son, Danny Hall</p>

Collins, and John Roy &quot;Boss Man&quot; of Topmost, Kentucky. Aunt Mae became

a member to the Providence Old Regular Baptist Church and lived a faithful and

dedicated member for 59 years. Uncle Bill never became a member to any church,

but let many friends and neighbors know that everything was all right between

him and God. As they had many hardships in life, it seemed as though they

accepted each with little or no complaints. As their health began to fail, in

July 1993, they were admitted to the Martin County Health Care Facility at Inez,

Kentucky, where they remained until death. In life they both cherished the very

little things, anyone visiting, church, and Aunt Mae enjoyed her sewing,

crocheting, gardening and flowers. Each held a very special place in their

hearts. Aunt Mae leaves 2 sisters, Viola Lewis and Daisy Mullins, both of

Virgie, Kentucky, and 1 brother, Jesse Bates, and a host of nieces and nephews.

Uncle Bill leaves 3 brothers: Morgan Hall, Salyersville, Ky.; C.M. Isaacs,

It is with sadness, broken hearts, and great pride in his accomplishments that we have attempted to write this tribute to our grandfather, Tommy Hall. Our home will never be the same anymore since our Papa has gone to be with Jesus. No words can express how we feel about our Papa. He was so full of life, happiness, and love for his family.<br>

Tommy Hall was born on Dec. 7, 1916 at Melvin, Kentucky. He was the son of the late George and Pricie Cole Hall. He had three brothers and four sisters. He is survived by two brothers, Earnest and Vondall, and one sister, Daisy.<br>

One thing Papa instilled in all of us was a good work ethic. He was passionate and dependable with anything he set out to do. For a large portion of his life, he worked in the coal mines. He worked for both Inland Steel and Island Creek Coal Companies. Papa took most

pride in being a long-standing member of the United Mine Workers Association,

Local Union 5899. Papa was very involved in his community. He was responsible

for starting the little league baseball program in Wheelwright. Papa's strong

love for baseball and children continued all of his life. Including becoming a

member of Joppa Church, one of the most important decisions Papa ever made was

December 21, 1939 when he married our grandmother, Maggie Hall. Papa vowed to

always provide for her and his family. He certainly kept his promise. Together

they raised three children, Suette, Patti, and Terry. They will always be

grateful to their Daddy for providing a good, loving home, life, and education.

Papa's belief of a good education continues through two generations, and

speaking for all of us we intend to carry on the tradition. Tommy was crazy

about his family. He has seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. We

each have been influenced by his personality and the life he lived. He taught

Todd and me how to play the banjo and guitar; Chad and Aaron, baseball; and all

of us his great sense of humor. I know a lot of family and friends are probably

thinking right now of their own stories about our Papa. He never met a stranger

and had a story or joke for everyone. Papa was kind and gentle to all of his

family and in March of 1993 he joined the Joppa Old Regular Baptist Church. He

and Mama attended every Sunday as long as health permitted. Papa loved his

church and his Brothers and Sisters. Papa wanted the best for his church and has

worked diligently to obtain land from the Railroad for Joppa Church. Our family

intends to pursue this in his honor. Today we say goodbye to a great husband,

father, and grandfather. Papa, we miss you and think of you daily. As you look

down on us from Heaven, we want you to know we will take care of Mammaw. We love

you and we know you are in a better place. Written by granddaughters Robin Rose

<p align="left">(1936-1995) With a sad and broken heart and the help of the Lord

we will try to write an obituary of a loving husband, father, and grandfather,

Burley Hamilton. Burley was born December 28, 1936 to the late Hasquie and

Gustie Hamilton of Clintwood Virginia. He was the youngest of 12 children, 6 of

whom preceded him in death. He died October 9, 1995 at the Joppa Old Regular

Baptist Church at Melvin Ky, in the lunchroom, making his stay here on earth 58

years 10 months and 12 days. Burley met and fell in love with Sadie (T.R.)

Johnson Hamilton. They were united in the eyes of God on January 17, 1958, and

into this union they were blessed with 5 children, 3 boys and 2 girls: Avery

(Jackie) Hamilton; Mary Sue Jones of Melvin, Ky.; Terry B Hamilton of McDowell,

Ky.; Gary Hamilton of Melvin, Ky.; Shelia Anna Tackett of Hi Hat, Ky. Burley

worked as a truck driver and a coal miner. He worked until the doctors took him

out of the mines because he was disabled. He worked hard each day and every day

to provide for his family, whom he loved so much. He had an even greater love

for God. He joined Joppa Old Regular Baptist Church May 9, 1992 and was baptized

by Elder Hershell Slone and Elder Arnold Tackett. That Sunday morning he was so

excited to tell everyone what good things the Lord had done for him that he

didn't wait for the church door to open to give his hand he went during

services. He filled his seat faithfully until moments before his death. When he

went to his sister churches he would always stand up and invite everyone to come

visit Joppa Church. His favorite song was &quot;I'm Going To Die On The

Battlefield&quot; and he sung it only a few weeks before his death at his

nephew's funeral. One of his brothers and sisters in church called him

&quot;Wild Man,&quot; while others called him &quot;Smiley&quot; or

&quot;Happy&quot; because he was always smiling. He greeted everyone with a

smile and a warm hand shake. He never met a stranger because he always had a

kind word to say to everyone he met. He showed his kindness and love to everyone

in and out of church. He would go visit sick people in the hospital and their

homes. If anyone needed him, he would help in any way he could. Left to mourn

his death are his wife; children; 8 grandchildren; 1 sister, Maxie Stanley; 4

brothers: Carson, Lincoln, Kermit, and his twin brother Worley Hamilton, all of

Clintonwood, Va.; and a host of nieces, nephews, friends, brothers, and sisters

in church. We all loved him more than words can say and our hearts ache each and

every day for him. He will live forever in our hearts. We will allow the

memories to live through his children and grandchildren. His death has left an

empty place in all our hearts that can never be filled. But our loss is Heaven's

gain, for there is one more bright star in God's Heaven. He can't come back to

us, but by the Grace of God we can go to him. Sleep on, sleep on. until we meet

again for your work here on earth is done. Written by a broken-hearted family</p>

write this obituary for our departed, but never forgotten, father and

grandfather. Ervin Hamilton was born August 12, 1914 in Teaberry, the son of the

late Wilburn Lee and Martha Jane Tackett Hamilton. Ervin passed away October 24,

1985, after a long illness. Ervin was 71 years of age. Ervin was preceded in

death by one daughter, Wanda Hamilton, two sisters, two brothers, one grandchild

and one great-grandchild. Ervin leaves to walk the path with God to take his

place in Heaven. He leaves to mourn his departure his beloved wife, Lillie Mae

Tackett Hamilton; four sons: Ray Hamilton Jr. and Will Hamilton of Beaver; Ervin

Hamilton Jr. of Lexington; Paul Eugene Hamilton of Danville; four daughters:

Elizabeth Henson, Geneva Hall, Eva Vance and Verdie Mae Hamilton all of Beaver;

six brothers: Frank and Sterling Hamilton both of Teaberry; Hershel and Willie

Hamilton, both of Beaver; Russell Hamilton of Price and Wilburn Hamilton Jr. of

Willard, Ohio; three sisters: Hazel Bentley and Mary Newsome, both of Beaver;

Goldia Newsome of Price; 30 grandchildren and 43 great-grandchildren and 2

great-great-grandchildren; many nieces, nephews, and friends. Ervin was a

retired coal miner; he was a member of the U.M.W.A Local No. 8100 at Ligon. The

last few words that I heard my grandfather say were, &quot;God's sending his

angels to take me home to be with my mother, girls pray with me.&quot; He took

his daughters' hands, they began to pray, tears gently fell, they could see this

peaceful look within him. God took away the foundation of the light and the man,

but the light still shines and the memories still linger. The light shines

bright in all our minds, our hearts and our dreams. The light that time will

never dim, the man that we all will never forget. Father was one of the true

gentleman of our times. He seemed to enjoy everyone that he met and left a great

impression upon them. He liked visiting the courthouse to see his old buddies,

and meeting new friends, for he never met a stranger. He especially loved the

visits from the family and friends, for you had to sit down and watch his

favorite sports, basketball and baseball games, or the news. You could look at

him, and in his eyes you could see the warmth and love that was within him. His

memory will always live on in our hearts and when the time comes for God to take

us home, will take the path, and we shall unite again in Heaven's paradise.

write this obituary for our cherished mother and grandmother. Lillie Mae Tackett

Hamilton was born June 1, 1917 at Teaberry, Kentucky, the daughter of the late

George and Becky Bentley Tackett of Beaver, Ky. She passed away February 14,

1996. She lived a fulfilled 78 years. Lillie Mae married the late Ervin Hamilton

on June 29,1933. Preceding her in death are 1 daughter, Wanda Hamilton, 3

sisters, 4 brothers, 1 grandchild and 2 great-grandchildren. Lillie Mae left

with her heart full of happiness for she has taken her place in Heaven, to walk

with God in perfect peace. She leaves behind her to mourn 8 children: Elizabeth

Henson of Ivel, Ky.; Geneva June Hall, Eva June Vance, Verdie Mae Hamilton, Ray

Lexington, Ky.; and Paul Eugene Hamilton of Danville, Ky. Also left are thirty

grandchildren, forty-three great-grandchildren, two great-great-grandchildren,

and many nieces, nephews and friends. In our hearts we feel God took our mother

on February 14, Valentines Day, to be with her beloved husband, Ervin, to

reunite their everlasting love for eternity. One thing people always remembered

about mother was her kind, warming smile. The family will never forget how that

smile never ceased to warm their hearts. Forget your grief and tears, for that

shining smile she had on earth is brighter, for she is in a perfect place. Mamaw

loved to attend the Samaria Regular Baptist Church, when she was able. She loved

working in her garden and raising her radiant flowers. To show her affection on

those long winter days she made sublime quilts for her children. They will

always possess these quilts she made with such maternal love. Each time we

visited Mamaw, she would want us to either be sitting, talking and laughing, or

sometimes, if they needed it, water her plants. She would always make sure that

everyone had eaten. Mamaw was always sitting on the porch waiting for company,

she loved having friends and family stop by and visit. We are happy to say that

in the years she was with us she was always there for us, she didn't ask

questions or judge us, she sat and listened with an understanding heart. We

believe she tried to lead us down the right path, for she had the wisdom,

strength, and the love in her heart to help us in our times of need. We would

ask her &quot;What would we ever do without you?&quot; she would always reply

with &quot;Don't worry, I would never leave my family.&quot; Now we all realize

what she meant, for she is still in our hearts. One very special gift she gave

us was how to be a better person and parent, and to always show the love you

have for your family. Our one wish is to be as strong, good, and loving as she

was. You always saw these qualities in her. We feel that Mamaw is resting in

peace with the Lord and loved ones. We believe our loss is Heaven's gain.

Dad worked in the coal mines for many years until he became disabled. For

several years Dad has been in and out of the hospital with bleeding ulcers,

diabetes, and a liver problem. We all thought he would suffer and die in a

hospital, but each time he always pulled through. When Dad left this world, he

died peacefully at home. Dad didn't belong to any church, but many Christian

people have told us of the good dreams they <br>

have had of him since his death. Daddy had a kind word and friendly laugh, as

well as a loving heart for all that knew him. The family, relatives, and friends

will all mourn the great loss of our Levi. Our home will never be the same

without Dad. There are tears in my eyes for you Daddy. We Love and miss you,

Dad. Written in loving memory, by his wife and children</p>

<p align="left">It is with fond memories, love in my heart, and with the help of

the almighty Lord, that I write the obituary of my dear mother-in-law and sister

in Christ. Octavia (Parsons) Hamilton was born August 18, 1910 and departed this

life on March 18, 1996 at the age of 85. She was the daughter of Isaac Parsons

and Mary Darcus (Hamilton) Parsons. She was one of 14 children; 12 preceded her

in death. One sister survives her, Melvinia P Gillis of Frankfort, Ky. Her late

sisters were: Armenia Taylor, Elizabeth Catherine Crum, Allie McMann, and Della

Hall. Her late brothers were: Jim Bob, John, Bill, Elemer, Zion, Jackson, and

twins Richard and Wilburn, who died in infancy. Octavia married Anthony

Hamilton, who survives her, on May 28, 1927. Anthony is the son of Freeman

Davenport &quot;Bud&quot; Hamilton and Virginia (Hall) Hamilton. From the union

between Anthony and Octaiva were born seven children. The first son died in

infancy. Edfert Hamilton of Lexington, Ky deceased October 17, 1990. Eddie

Hamilton of Harold, Ky.; Palmer Hamilton of Harold, KY; Gillis Hamilton of

Elkton, Md.; and Clara Martin of Elkton, Md. are left to mourn their dear

mother's passing. She also leaves 17 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren,

three step-great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild. Tava was

baptized August 20, 1978. Her membership was at Pilgrim's Home Old Regular

Baptist Church. Often they walked over three miles to church, when they didn't

have a ride. She fell and broke her hip around 1987 and never fully recovered.

She was bedridden and afflicted with much pain and suffering the last years of

her life. She was cared for by a devoted husband, Anthony, and her son, Palmer,

as well as her daughter-in-law, Joyce. Great will be their reward in Heaven for

their love and care that they gave to Mom. They met her every need. Her

daughter-in-law, Betty, who was like a daughter to her, often said Tava was the

only mother she ever knew, and she treated her like her own mother. This is only

a temporary &quot;goodbye,&quot; until we are reunited in Heaven when God calls

all His children home. Mom is no longer in pain, but resting in the arms of

Jesus Christ. She can not come back to us, but we can go to her, someday!

<p align="left">In loving memory of Travis Dwayne Hamilton - he was a loving

son, a devoted brother, a caring grandson. It is so hard to try to write an

obituary of a loved one. Dwayne was killed in a tragic accident on January 13,

1996. He was taken from us so fast, Dwayne knew how much we loved him. He will

never know how much we will miss him, and how much he meant to all of us. My son

will never know how much I miss him. Dwayne's father, Travis Darrell Hamilton,

was killed in a car accident when Dwayne was just a baby. He never got to know

his dad and know how much he was like him. Dwayne had a big heart, he always let

his family know that what was his was theirs, too. Dwayne left behind his

stepfather, Ricky Hamilton, who had been with him for twenty-one years. He also

left behind three brothers: Steven Darrell, Ricky Darren and Christopher Scott;

and one sister, Candy Deneen, all living at Teaberry. His grandparents who

preceded him in death are Little Ellis and Mellie Tackett of Beaver and Carlos

Hamilton of Teaberry. His grandmother, Ethel Hamilton, is still living at

Teaberry. If Dwayne were here with us he would be an uncle now, I know that

would have made him so happy. Dwayne, please watch over little Tyler Dwayne. I

know my son is in Heaven. God, my angel is now your angel. Not one day goes by

that he is not on my mind and I still can't speak his name without tears in my

eyes and pain in my heart. God, you have a plan for Dwayne, you needed him with

You in Heaven. Watch over us, help us make it through the day, help ease the

pain along the way. Now Dwayne, you get to meet Dad, walk with in Glory Land.

You love to hear your music every day. I know you were smiling when the harps in

Heaven began to play and the sweetness of the sounds when the angels sing.

Dwayne, know that you are missed every day, and you will never be forgotten.

said he could have joined the Church twelve years earlier. He was baptized by

Elders Monroe Jones and Dewey Roberts, and took his membership to the Old Long

Fork Regular Baptist Church, where he remained a faithful member until his

passing. Dad, we all love and miss you, we had to say good-bye for now but only

for a short while. When we meet again there will be no dialysis machines, no

pain, no sorrow, no tears, and best of all no parting of our ways. We are all

yet saddened by your death but feel we gained much by knowing you and having

shared your love. The old home will never be the same but if we will do the will

her beloved husband, Basil Hampton, on December 9, 1932. To this union were born

two children, Gladzie Fern and Vernon Webster, both of whom died in infancy.

Basil, her faithful husband of 64 years, stood by her bedside during the last

five years of her life and was at that post on Saturday morning when the angel

from Heaven came and took her home to receive her great reward. Martha joined

the Old Regular Baptist Church the fourth Saturday in April, 1935 at the young

age of 17. She was baptized that same day by Elder Drake Bowling and remained a

faithful member for over 61 years. She was an inspiration to all who knew her!

She never failed to tell you about Jesus and to talk about her church. Her

greatest joy in life came from getting dinner ready for the Enterprise Church

each church time and telling &quot;Bas,&quot; which is what she called him, just

how to place the food in the trunk of the car to protect it. She really loved

her church! Martha did so much to help the people of this community that it will

never be the same without her. She would love to shout, sing and praise her Lord

at church so much that it will never be the same without her. She lived a full

and happy life on earth and I'm sure she is now receiving the reward she was

always looking for. She will certainly be in that number when the saints go

<p align="left">With loving memories I will write this obituary of one that was

so dear to us, Edgar Hicks. He was born to the late Bill and Jemima Frasure

Hicks on August 5, 1916 at Pyramid, Kentucky in Floyd County, and departed this

life on November 28, 1995 of a sudden illness. Edgar was united in marriage to

Pearlie Marie Hale Hicks on December 15, 1942. Unto this union were born 10

children, including two sets twins. Surviving besides his dear companion,

Pearlie, are three daughters: Ruby Oliver, Flatwoods, Ky. Mima Parsons and Betty

Vanhorn both of Ashland, Ky.; and seven sons: Edgar W. (Eddie) of Ocala, FL.;

Michael (Mike) Charles, Paul and Henderson all of Ashland, KY; Melvin and Mark

of Lexington, Ky; fifteen grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Also left

to mourn their loss are three brothers: Floyd of Willard, Ohio; Willie,

Prestonsburg, KY; Burnis of Wilmington, Ohio; and three sisters: Delphia Fryer

and Edna Prater, both of Ashland, Ky.; and Margie White, Fayetteville, N.C.

Preceding him in death were three brothers: Ezra, Ernest and Elzie; and two

sisters, Ellen Shepherd and Anna Prater. Edgar was baptized by Elders Baxter

Osborne and Elias Cotton on December 7, 1946 and placed his membership with the

Little Jewell Church in Ashland, Ky. On December 10, 1978 he went by letter to

the Little Mary Church in Ashland and was ordained a deacon there on July 14,

1979, where he remained in fellowship until death. For outstanding service to

his country during World War II Edgar was awarded several medals, including the

Purple Heart. He was employed for several years by A.C. Lawrence Leather Co. and

Ramey Ford in Ashland, Kentucky. Edgar suffered a stroke about six years ago,

which left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak except a few words. Even

though he was confined to a wheel chair, he was never demanding but kind and

patient. We believe the life he lived was a light to all who knew him. He loved

company, and was always so pleased when the brothers and sisters from church

came to visit. Although we miss him so much, we feel that he has gone to that

eternal home where there is joy and peace forever. Edgar was laid to rest in the

Happy Ridge Cemetery in Ashland, Ky. Written by his sister, Delphia Fryer The 28

of November is a day I will always remember. To me it was a sad day, because I

got news from home that my Dad had passed away. Even though it hurts to know

he's gone from us at last, we know he's not suffering now, like he did in years

that's passed. He's singing now and shouting, I know he's being blessed, For now

he's Home with Jesus, to claim his peaceful rest. Written by his son, Edgar W.

<p align="left">In loving memory of our beloved daddy, I will try with much

sadness to write the obituary of Newberry Howell. He was the son of the late

Green and Nannie Hamilton Howell. He was born on April 26, 1930 and passed away

on Thursday night October 5, 1996 at 8:15 at his home. He went from this world

into God's loving care. Daddy had punished so much the last two years and prayed

so hard not to smother, but to go in his sleep. He went easy, I don't think he

even knew. His surviving brother and sisters are: Will Palmer Howell, Rosanna

Hamilton, Jean Deskins and Alice Miller. He married our mother, Pearl Carroll,

on July 17, 1952. There were three children born, one set of twins, Shirley

Compton on Virley Parsons Gunter, and one son, Cecil Howell. Daddy was a welder

and meter reader for Ashland Oil Exploration and retired after working for 40

years. He was dearly loved by the men and women at Ashland Oil. Those who came

to his funeral know what a beautiful service it was. He had an Ashland motorcade

from the funeral home to church and onto the gravesite. The men from Ashland Oil

helped to make the cemetery for him and they were his honorary pallbearers. It

was so beautiful that day, like God was smiling down on us. He would have been

so proud. He would thank each and everyone for coming. Daddy joined the Old

Regular Baptist Church after he had prayed and prayed about it. He would tell me

he felt he wasn't good enough, or wasn't doing good enough for the Lord. We

talked about it often and he would tell me his dreams. At last he had a dream

about &quot;Papaw&quot; (Green Howell). He was motioning for him to come with

him. Daddy said he couldn't leave his family, brothers, and sisters. Papaw told

him it was all right, that they would come later. So after that dream, he could

join with a good heart. One Saturday I was over cleaning house and Daddy ask me,

&quot;What are we going to do with all them babies?&quot; I told him he had

three babies. He said, &quot;Not them, all these in white dresses.&quot; Once he

asked Virley and Mom to watch those babies on the bed. He had told Aunt Alice

and Aunt Rosanna about people singing old-time songs. I know in my heart Daddy

is in a better place. I know Daddy was grateful for those who helped to give his

shots and pills, and work that machine from Texas. He would thank Virley, Patsy

, Mom, and especially Aunt Alice for being there every night. He once told Aunt

Rosanna, &quot;Now you can have Alice when I'm gone, but let me keep her

now.&quot; Thank you all, from the bottom of his heart Daddy has seven

grandchildren: Nathan Eric, Billy Brian and John Russell Parsons, Brooke Anne

and Jessica Lane Compton, Starsky Michael and Chase Tyler Howell. Daddy told

Cecil he didn't care to die, he just hated to leave the children. We all miss

you so much. I love you, Daddy. With much sadness and all my love, Shirley (Mamaw's

a person that you would fall in love with from the first time you met him. He

was everyone's grandpa. John C. Huff had a heart made of gold. He was the most

beautiful person on this earth. We hope to see you one day, Grandpa. Written by

his family, who love and miss him</p>

<p align="left">Today seems like such an empty day, my heart is broken, my tears

are flowing, but Jesus said He would bottle them up. By the grace of God I pray

Mom is resting until the great morning and all who love and keep God's

commandments can rise again when the trumpet sounds. We can all go rejoicing

home together. My mother was Mary Jane Hunter. She was born to John and Jane

Marshall on Stephen's Branch, Ky. August 20, 1901. Mom married Craig Hunter in

1919. They lived a Christian life and raised nine children. Three infants died

just after birth. Dad died in 1969, leaving Mom and nine of us children to mourn

our loss. In 1984, Marvin and Myrtie died and Verlie died in 1986. Gervie passed

away in 1995. Now there are five of us left to mourn the loss of our mother. Mom

belonged to Little Dove Church. She was a faithful member as long as she could

go. She joined the Little Dove Church October, 1934. She always enjoyed the

church and good people. Her doors were always open when she kept house. The

coffee pot and cake were always ready. No matter who came, she wanted them to

eat before they left. Mom spent the last seven or eight years with me. I fed her

every bite she ate for the last seven months of her life. Mom was very special

to her children and 46 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. There was a great

host of us all. We did everything we could for Mom to make her life comfortable.

Mom told us the week before she died that she was going to die. She started an

old song, &quot;Oh Sing to Me of Heaven When I am Called to Die.&quot; She sang

one verse real plain. Brother Freddy got the song book and finished singing it

for her. She loved to hear him sing. He was so good to Mom. He would lift her

from her wheelchair to the recliner and to bed. Mom, sleep on and rest. By the

Grace of God we will see you again. I hope the family will read the old King

James version Bible and prepare to get ready, because Jesus is coming again,

ready or not. He said it would have been better if you would have never been

born when your time is up. It's too late then. Love you all. Don't forget the

Old Regular Baptist Church. It's been a good home for me and Mom. Love and

prayers to all, Sister Sue Kidd and Brother Freddy Kidd</p>

<p align="left">It is with a sad and broken heart that we will try to write an

obituary of Dorothy Johnson. Dorothy was the daughter of the late Has Johnson

and Lillie Mae Hall Johnson. Dorothy was born on November 20, 1957 and departed

from this life June 20, 1996, making her stay here on earth 38 years and 7

months. Dorothy died at the McDowell Hospital following a long illness. Dorothy

was preceded in death by her father, four brothers and one sister. Left to mourn

their loss are her mom, Lillie Mae Johnson, four brothers: Otis Johnson. Bailey

KY; three sisters: Thelma Quillen of Dwale, KY; Bessie Keltner of Lima, Ohio and

Annie Gessel of Bevinsville, KY; many nieces, nephews, relatives, friends, and

Dorothy to come on in, that her pain and suffering are over. Her soul is at rest

around God's great throne. So we like to say to Dorothy's loved ones that she

had left back here, If you ever want to see her again you will have to serve the

same God as Dorothy did. Mom and I feel with all of our hearts that we will be

with her again and all of our loved ones gone on before us. Written by her

Brother, Mom, Otis and Lillie Mae Johnson &quot;Sleep on, Dorothy, `till

judgment day, when God will wake you from the sleeping grace. The ground will

open where you now lay and we will join you on the great day.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">It is with great sadness that we will try to write this obituary

of our loving parents, Harvey (June) Johnson and Oma (Thornsberry) Johnson. Dad

was born June 4, 1917, at Weeksbury, Ky. to the late Francis Marion and Leander

(Burke) Johnson who preceded him in death. He also has four brothers and one

sister who preceded him in death. Dad left us on April 13, 1994, making his stay

on earth 76 years, 10 months and 9 days. Then, exactly one year later, we lost

our sweet loving mother, Oma (Thornsberry) Johnson. She was born October 5,

1924, in Knott County to the late Cecil and Linda (Caudill) Thornsberry who

preceded her in death. She left us on April 13, 1995, making her stay on earth

70 years, 6 months and 8 days. She has two sisters and one brother who preceded

her in death. Mom and Dad were united in marriage on May 18, 1939, and to this

union 15 children were born. There are two sons, two daughters, one grandson,

and one granddaughter that preceded them in death. Surviving children are: Irene

Jones of Kite, Ky.; Myrtle Bates of Wayland, Ky.; Lois Caudill of Virgie, Ky.--,

Polly Bates of Topmost, Ky.; Ray Johnson, Joe Johnson, Jerry Johnson, Eddie

Johnson all of Kite, Ky.; Alice Collins, Barcy Slone, and Martha Hall all of

Topmost, Ky. They have 32 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren who mourn

their loss. Dad leaves behind two brothers, Joe Johnson and Ivan Johnson, and

one sister, Alma Johnson. Mom leaves behind seven sisters to mourn: Rosie Isaac,

Irene Isaac, Elizabeth Walker, Nancy Walker, Annie Doner, Marla Slate, and

Merlene Burchett. Our parents will surely be missed by all who loved them. They

left us hope that they are with our Lord, Jesus Christ, in Heaven. So, brothers

and sisters, let's make preparations so we all can be with them in Heaven. They

would want all their children with them, and let's hope that each and every one

of the children take heed and change before it's too late. So, sleep on Mommy

and Daddy, we love you both so much. Written by a broken-hearted familv</p>

<p align="left">Sister Lizzie Johnson was born on May 30, 1913 to William and

day. She was preceded in death by her husband, Bro. Andy Johnson; 8 brothers:

Lizzie received forgiveness and joined the Old Regular Baptists when she was a

young and tender girl of 17 years. Sister Lizzie loved to have singing and

praying and preaching in her home to the very end of her life. Sister Lizzie

doesn't need that anymore, but she requested nearly every brother and sister to

counsel her grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren

that if they wanted to be with Granny and Poppy again, they would have to get to

know Jesus in a pardon and remission of sin. Everybody who knew Sister Lizzie

knew how she loved to talk, but she did not just talk the talk of being a

Christian mother, she walked the walk. Now she is resting after her faithful

journey. Written by Bro. Herman McCown, Jr.</p>

on October 2, 1983. She first went to the Freewill Baptist Church, then she told

me of a dream she had of two angels coming and standing at the foot of her bed

and telling her to go be baptized into the Old Regular Baptist Church, and then

she would be happy. Jason and Jessica, Mommaw loved you both so much. You will

never know how much she referred to you all as her babies. Every time I talked

to her she said something about you all in some way. Just try to meet her in

Heaven someday. Russell, I know how lonely you must be without her, but let me

beg you to fall out with sin and be born again so you can meet her in Heaven

when this life is over. I believe with all my heart I will see her again before

long. Then we can rejoice together around that Bright Throne. I believe God

needed another rose for His garden, so he picked her. I miss talking to her, but

I can look forward to seeing her again. Let me say to Wayne, &quot;Son, I know

you will miss Mom and that you loved her, she loved you so much, but try to meet

her in Heaven someday.&quot; I will close this obituary by saying, &quot;Sleep

on, Sis. I hope to meet you over there on that bright shore. Written by her

<p align="left">With the help of God I will write an obituary of my late husband

Ezra Jones. Ezra was born September 24, 1923 to the late Ambrose Jones and

Jannie Quillen. He left this world March 31 st, 1996, making his stay here 72

years 6 months and 7 days. Ezra was a good man. He joined the Samaria Church in

1965 and became an ordained minister in 1968. He worked so hard to raise his

family. He loved his family very much. Ezra was first married to the late Annie

Hamilton. To them were born six children. Three preceded him in death. Left to

mourn their loss are his children: Joanne lames of Florida, Ezra Jones, Jr. of

Ohio and Jimmy Jones of Betsy Layne, Ky. Later he married Verna Hamilton and

they had two children, Joetta Adkins and Travis Glen Jones both of Grethel. He

left behind one brother, Elder Aaron Jones, twelve grandchildren and eleven

great-grandchildren. He loved his daughters-in-law, Angela and Brenda Jones,

like his own daughters, and his grandson, Randy Lambert, and his wife, Lisa. His

granddaughter, Denise Jones, was like his own. He loved her so. Denise loved him

like a dad. She misses him very much, as we all do. Ezra was hospitalized at the

McDowell Appalachian Regional Hospital for seventy days due to cancer. The

family took care of Ezra day and night. I don't know what I would have done

without my family and friends. I want to thank everyone who helped. I want to

thank Dr. Vicher and all the doctors and wonderful nurses and staff who cared

for Ezra. I will never forget any of them, because they were so good to Ezra and

all of us. We all love them for their help. I get so lonesome sometimes, but he

can't come back to us. I believe he is with Jesus now, at peace. I miss him so

much. By the help of God we can meet him one day. So I want to say to the

children, if you want to live with Daddy again, you had better pray today. He is

missed very much by every life that he touched. We all love and miss him. So

sleep on, just for a little time. We will be with you soon. We will never forget

you. I will meet you someday in Heaven, so tell Jesus I'm waiting on Him.

Jimmy Lee, Steve and Kristi. His daughter-in-law, Gwen, became the same as a

&quot;Papa's Pet.&quot; He also leaves three sisters: Jenny Alley, Gormet

Hamilton, and Marie Samons; one brother, Rudolph Jones; and a host of in-laws,

nieces, nephews and friends to mourn his death. He turned his life over to the

Lord and was shown so many blessings. His strength and faith has been an

inspiration to us. We have so many memories and the empty place in our hearts

<p align="left">It is with a sad and broken heart that we attempt to write the

obituaries of our dear, loving parents, Zettie &amp; Walter Justice. Dad and Mom

were married December 18, 1945, and to this union five children were born:

Brenda, Bonnie, Patrica, Bernice, and Clark. Mom was born July 1, 1928 and

departed this life May 27, 1977. She was the daughter of Johnny and Ethel Dye

Akers. She was preceded in death by her parents and three brothers. Mom never

worked outside the home, she was a homemaker. Mom went to church, but she never

joined - but she was a praying woman because she told us about it. We believe

she is resting in the arms of Jesus. Dad was born September 18, 1913, and

departed this life September 11,1995. He was the son of Will and Lourissa Farmer

Justice. He was preceded in death by his parents, wife, one granddaughter, eight

brothers, and a twin sister. He is survived by five children, 14 grandchildren,

and one sister. Dad was a carpenter by trade. He joined the old Regular Baptist

Church August 18, 1989, and was baptized the same day by Brother Wendell

Hamilton and Ellis Holbrook. Dad was in good health until June 1995. He was

never able to make it back to church. Every weekend he would talk about where

church was that day, he always wished he was able to be with his brothers and

sisters. He enjoyed all the visits from his brothers and sisters when they came

to talk and pray with him. He never gave up his faith in the Lord. About seven

hours before he died he told us he was walking with the Lord, and we. know he is

just gone home to be with a friend. Sadly Missed by their children,

grandchildren, and great-grandchildren</p>

<p align="left">We, the family, will try to write the obituary of our much loved

mother, Cindy Kidd. Mom was born April 28, 1912 at Honaker, Kentucky. She was

the daughter of Andrew Jackson Case and Nora Bell Kidd-Case. She was married to

our beloved father, Allen Kidd, on March 7, 1929. He preceded her in death on

June 13, 1989. Unto this union were born twelve children, eight girls and four

boys. These children are: Nannie Mae Hampton of Dayton, Ohio; Shirley Branham of

Vermilion, Ohio; Eugene Kidd of Morgantown, Ky.; Juanita Kidd-Cook of Norwalk,

Ohio; Minnie Jarrell of Banner, Ky.; Alice Faye Lawson of Dana, Ky.; Willard

Kidd of Hi Hat, Ky.; and Lora Katherine Akers of Banner, Ky. The deceased

children are Aline Crum, Magaline Kidd, William Green Kidd and Cecil Kidd. She

also has nineteen grandchildren and seventeen great-grandchildren who loved her

dearly. She was a member of the Little Salem Old Regular Baptist Church since

1952. There aren't enough words that could express how much we are going to miss

our mother. She was the most gentle and kind person anyone could know. We never

knew what it was for her not to be caring and loving. She didn't know how to be

mean, she just knew how to love her family. Our mother was a kind hearted and

forgiving person. Her heart was full of love for this family who is grieving for

her today. She was generous to a fault and loved her children, grandchildren and

great-grandchildren more than anything. Although we all grieve for her and feel

an enormous loss, we have to have faith that she is in a better place. She is

with Jesus today and I feel that she is watching over all of us right now. She

would want us all to continue loving one another as only a close family can. We

will have to stop and just remember the love she had for us all and draw

strength from that love. Written by the family</p>

Arthur Kiser, deceased in infancy, and Reed Kiser of Jenkins, Kentucky; 2

daughters, Belle Tackett of Pikeville, Kentucky, Mary Lou White of Bolivia,

North Carolina; 5 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren, all left to mourn

Old Regular Baptist faith. She will be sadly missed by her brothers and sisters

<p align="left">Bonnie G. Hall Kohler was born December 17, 1935, the daughter

of Everett and the late Carrie 0. Hall of Bevinsville, Ky. She departed this

life May 5, 1996 in an automobile accident in the state of Michigan, making her

stay here on this earth 60 years, 4 months and 18 days. She is survived by her

husband, Donald Kohler; one daughter, Deborah Thomas; two sons, Michael and Mark

Castle; and six grandchildren. Also surviving are six sisters: Eileen Johnson,

Lorraine Little, Jeanette Ramey, JoAnn West, Barbara Joyce Harris, Emily Ellen

Youngert; and one brother, James Wesley Hall, and numerous nieces and nephews.

Our hearts are so heavy with deep sorrow upon the loss of our dear loved one.

She was such a kind, loving, and giving person who was always there in times of

need. She gave herself so unselfishly. She was not a member of the church, but

one thing she had in her favor was that she believed the truth about repentance

and faith toward God, which is the basic principal of the doctrine of Jesus

Christ our Lord. Don, her husband, said that after the accident she was praying

to the Lord with much fervor, and we believe that because of the dreams and

visions that the Lord has given us as a witness her soul is in the Paradise of

God to await the resurrection of the body on that great and notable day.
